Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.)

Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, credit losses, advertising costs, and professional service fees.  The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead.  Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base.  However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023

Overview

Consolidated revenues in 2024 increased 8% to $910.9 million, from $841.3 million in 2023.  Consolidated net income in 2024 increased to $231.7 million, or $9.43 per diluted share in 2024, compared to $174.6 million, or $7.12 per diluted share, in 2023.  The increase in consolidated net income and earnings per diluted share during the year was primarily attributed to the $180.0 million gain on merger termination, partly offset by $63.2 million in transaction costs attributed to the terminated merger with Willscot Mobile Mini, net of provision for income taxes.  Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2023, included the $61.5 million gain on sale of discontinued operations from the divestiture of Adler Tanks, net of tax.  Excluding the gain and transaction costs attributed to the merger termination in the current year, and the gain on sale of discontinued operations in 2023, the Company's net income increased by approximately $33.9 million, or 30%, to $145.7 million, and diluted earnings per share increased $1.37, or 30%, to $5.93, compared to $4.56 in 2023.  The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales, rental, and rental related services revenues, as more fully described below.

There was no revenue, income or earnings per share from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $9.4 million and income from discontinued operations was $62.8 million, which included the net gain on sale of discontinued operations of $61.5 million.  Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.56.  For additional information on discontinued operations and the divestiture of Adler Tanks, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

For 2024 compared to 2023, on a consolidated basis from continuing operations:

•
Gross profit increased $41.8 million, or 11%, to $435.4 million.  Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $45.6 million, or 18%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues.  Portable Storage's gross profit decreased $5.0 million, or 7%, due to lower gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues.  TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit decreased $6.5 million, or 10%, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental and other revenues.  Enviroplex’s gross profit increased $7.7 million, primarily due to $25.6 million higher sales revenues and increased gross margin on sales revenues of 26.1%, compared to 20.9% in 2023.

•
Selling and administrative expenses decreased $7.1 million, or 3%, to $200.4 million, primarily due to $15.9 million in transaction costs incurred by the Company in 2023, attributed to the acquisitions of Vesta Modular, Brekke Storage, Dixie Storage and Inland Leasing, and the divestiture of Adler Tanks, partly offset by an increase in employee salaries and benefit costs of $7.8 million in 2024.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined that transaction costs incurred by the Company attributed to the terminated merger were significant and required separate presentation on the consolidated statements of income.  Due to this determination, the Company has excluded the transaction costs incurred by the Company from Selling and administrative expenses for all reportable business segments for the year ended December 31, 2024.

•
Other income, net increased $5.7 million due to the sale of a property in 2024, resulting in a net gain of $9.3 million, compared to the gain on sale of four properties in 2023.

•
Interest expense increased $6.7 million, due to 10% higher average debt levels of the Company, accompanied by 6% higher net average interest rates of 6.48% in 2024 compared to 6.12% in 2023.

•
Pre-tax income contribution by Mobile Modular, Portable Storage and TRS-RenTelco was 69%, 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to 62%, 22% and 16%, respectively, in 2023.  These results are discussed on a segment basis below.  Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 3% for 2024 and less than 1% for 2023.

•
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.1% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

•
Adjusted EBITDA increased $33.4 million, or 10%, to $351.7 million in 2024.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation and transaction costs.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found on page 45.

Mobile Modular

For 2024, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $73.1 million, or 13%, to $635.4 million compared to 2023, primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues.

Mobile Modular’s gross profit for 2024 increased $45.6 million, or 18%, to $303.5 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:

•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues
 – Rental revenues increased $32.6 million, or 11%, due to 9% higher average rental equipment on rent and 3% higher average monthly rental rates in 2024.  As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% in both 2024 and 2023, respectively, and other direct costs were 26% in 2024 and 30% in 2023, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 61% in 2024, compared to 57% in 2023.  The higher rental revenues and increased rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $33.1 million, or 20%, to $194.7 million in 2024.

•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services
 – Rental related services revenues increased $13.1 million, or 11%, compared to 2023.  The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher delivery, return delivery and dismantle revenues and higher site related services.  The higher revenues accompanied by higher gross margin percentage of 35% in 2024, compared to 34% in 2023, resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $4.9 million, or 13%, to $44.0 million in 2024.

•
Gross Profit on Sales
 – Sales revenues increased $28.0 million, or 18%, primarily due to higher new equipment sales of $143.3 million compared to $116.2 million in 2023.  The higher sales revenues and comparable gross margin of 32% in 2024, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $8.1 million, or 16%, to $58.3 million in 2024.  Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.

For 2024, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.9 million, or 1%, to $136.7 million, when compared to 2023.

Portable Storage

For 2024, Portable Storage’s total revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 7%, to $94.5 million compared to 2023, primarily due to lower rental and rental related services revenues, partly offset by $1.1 million higher sales revenues.  Lower gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues, partly offset by $0.4 million higher gross profit on sales revenues and a $2.3 million reduction in selling and administrative expenses, resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of $2.1 million, or 6%, to $30.8 million in 2024.

Portable Storage’s gross profit for 2024 decreased $5.0 million, or 7%, to $63.9 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:

•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues
 – Rental revenues decreased $4.6 million, or 6%, due to 7% lower average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 1% higher average monthly rental rates in 2024.  As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 6% and 5% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and other direct costs were 8% and 10% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 86% in 2024, compared to 85% in 2023.  The lower rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $3.5 million, or 6%, to $60.2 million in 2024.

•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services
 – Rental related services revenues decreased $2.8 million, or 14%, compared to 2023.  The decrease in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to a reduction in delivery and return delivery revenues.  The lower revenues coupled with lower gross margin percentage of 2% in 2024, compared to 9% in 2023, resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $1.5 million to $0.4 million, in 2024.

•
Gross Profit on Sales
 – Sales revenues increased $1.1 million, or 24%, primarily due to higher used equipment sales.  The higher sales revenues and comparable gross margin of 38% in 2024, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $0.4 million, or 24%, to $2.1 million in 2024.  Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Portable Storage’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.

For 2024, Portable Storage’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $2.3 million, or 7%, to $29.2 million, compared to $31.5 million in 2023.  The reduction in selling and administrative expenses was primarily the result of $2.5 million lower allocated corporate services, which in 2023 included transaction costs of $1.3 million, attributed to the divestiture of Adler Tanks.

TRS-RenTelco

For 2024, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues decreased $13.0 million, or 9%, to $135.2 million, compared to 2023, primarily due to lower rental and other revenues, partly offset by higher sales revenues.  Pre-tax income decreased $1.5 million, or 6%, to $23.2 million for 2024, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental and other revenues, partly offset by $1.9 million higher gross profit on sales revenues and a $4.0 million reduction in selling and administrative expenses.

TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit for 2024 decreased $6.5 million, or 10%, to $56.1 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:

•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues
 – Rental revenues decreased $12.5 million, or 11%, to $101.8 million, with depreciation expense decreasing $4.6 million, or 9%, and other direct costs decreasing $0.4 million, or 2%, resulting in a decrease in gross profit on rental revenues of $7.5 million, or 17%, in 2024 compared to 2023.  As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 43% and 42% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and other direct costs were 20% and 18% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 37% in 2024, compared to 40% in 2023.  The reduction in rental revenues was primarily attributed to 9% lower average rental equipment on rent and 2% lower average monthly rental rates. 

•
Gross Profit on Sales
 – Sales revenues increased $0.4 million, or 2%, to $27.5 million in 2024.  Gross profit on sales increased $1.9 million, or 14%, to $15.1 million, with a gross margin percentage of 55% in 2024, compared to 49% in 2023.  The higher gross margin during the year was primarily attributed to an increase in margin on used equipment sales.  Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.

For 2024, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $4.0 million, or 13%, to $27.0 million, when compared to 2023.  The reduction in selling and administrative expenses was primarily the result of $4.0 million lower allocated corporate services, which included transaction costs of $1.6 million in 2023 attributed to the divestiture of Adler Tanks.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022

Overview

Consolidated revenues in 2023 increased 13% to $841.3 million, from $733.8 million in 2022.  Consolidated net income in 2023, excluding the gain on sale of discontinued operations from the divestiture of Adler Tanks, decreased to $113.1 million, or $4.61 per diluted share in 2023, compared to $115.1 million, or $4.70 per diluted share, in 2022.  The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues, as more fully described below.

Revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $9.4 million, compared to $98.2 million for the same period in 2022.  Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $62.8 million, which included the net gain on sale of discontinued operations of $61.5 million, compared to $11.8 million for the same period in 2022.  Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.56, compared to $0.48 for the same period in 2022.  For additional information on discontinued operations and the divestiture of Adler Tanks, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

For 2023 compared to 2022, on a consolidated basis from continuing operations:

•
Gross profit increased $103.4 million, or 36%, to $393.6 million.  Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $96.0 million, or 59%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues.  Portable Storage's gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 25%, due to higher gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues.  TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit decreased $5.3 million, or 8%, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental and sales revenues.  Enviroplex’s gross profit decreased $0.9 million, or 17%, primarily due to $3.0 million lower sales revenues and lower gross margins of 20.9%, compared to 22.1% in 2022.

•
Selling and administrative expenses increased $64.6 million, or 45%, to $207.5 million, primarily due to increased headcount and employees’ salaries and benefit costs totaling $29.0 million, partly attributed to increased employee headcount from the Vesta Modular acquisition, and $21.4 million higher marketing and administrative costs, which included $15.9 million in acquisition and divestiture related transaction costs.

•
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold four properties, which resulted in a net gain on sale of $3.6 million.  The gain on sale, which was presented in Other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income, contributed $0.11 in earnings per diluted share.

•
Interest expense increased $28.3 million, due to 55% higher average debt levels of the Company, accompanied by 72% higher net average interest rates of 6.12% in 2023, compared to 3.55% in 2022.

•
Pre-tax income contribution by Mobile Modular, Portable Storage and TRS-RenTelco was 62%, 22% and 16%, respectively, compared to 50%, 22% and 27%, respectively, in 2022.  These results are discussed on a segment basis below.  Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was less than 1% for 2023 and 1% for 2022.

•
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.5% and 23.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The higher rate in 2023 was primarily due to changes in state business activity levels and nondeductible expenses.

•
Adjusted EBITDA increased $67.2 million, or 27%, to $318.4 million in 2023.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation and transaction costs.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found on page 45.

TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit for 2023 decreased $5.3 million, or 8%, to $62.6 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022:

•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues
 – Rental revenues decreased $7.1 million, or 6%, to $114.2 million, with depreciation expense decreasing $0.8 million, or 2%, and other direct costs decreasing $0.7 million, or 3%, resulting in a decrease in gross profit on rental revenues of $5.7 million, or 11%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 42% and 41% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and other direct costs were 18% in both 2023 and 2022, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 40% in 2023, compared to 42% in 2022.  The reduction in rental revenues was attributed to 7% lower average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 1% higher average monthly rental rates. 

•
Gross Profit on Sales
 – Sales revenues increased $2.5 million, or 10%, to $27.1 million in 2023.  Gross profit on sales decreased $1.6 million, or 11%, to $13.2 million, with a gross margin percentage of 49% in 2023, compared to 60% in 2022.  The reduction in gross margin during the year was primarily attributed to a decrease in margin on used equipment sales.  Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.

For 2023, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million, or 14%, to $31.0 million, primarily due to $2.6 million higher allocated corporate expenses, which included $1.6 million of allocated transaction costs from the divestiture of Adler Tanks, as compared to 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA

To supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs, share-based compensation, transaction costs, gains on property sales and non-operating transactions.  The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements.  Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges and non-operating transactions, including share-based compensation, transaction costs and gains on property sales is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company.  Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies.  Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges, transaction costs, gains on property sales and non-operating transactions.  The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow.  In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison.  The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation.  Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.  The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance.  Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from operations before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and non-operating transactions

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company’s unsecured Credit Facility, the Note Purchase Agreement, Series D Senior Notes, Series E Senior Notes and Series F Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”).  These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not:

•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this MD&A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 3.19 to 1.

•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 1.68 to 1.

At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants.  There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows.  Cash flows for the Company in 2024 as compared to 2023 are summarized as follows:

Cash Flows from Operating Activities:
 The Company’s operations provided net cash flows of $374.4 million for 2024,  compared to $95.3 million in 2023.  The $279.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the gain on merger termination from WillScot Mobile Mini after transaction costs, which contributed $86.0 million to net income during the year, and the $61.5 million gain on sale of discontinued operations of Adler Tanks included in operating activities during 2023.  Further, operating activities provided for an $61.6 million increase in accounts payable and a $43.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, as compared to 2023, which contributed to the net change in cash provided.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities:
 Net cash used in investing activities was $150.8 million for 2024, compared to $391.9 million in 2023.  The $241.1 million reduction in net cash used was primarily due to the $462.1 million paid for the business acquisitions of Vesta Modular, Brekke Storage, Dixie Storage and Inland Leasing in 2023, partly offset by $268.0 million in proceeds received from the sale of the Adler Tanks business.  The net effect of these transaction in 2023 was $194.1 million in cash used by investing activities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities:
 Net cash used in financing activities was $223.7 million in 2024, compared to net provided of $296.4 million in 2023.  The change in net cash during 2024 was primarily due to reduced borrowings under bank lines of credit and note purchase agreements.  The borrowings in 2023 were primarily attributed to the funding of the Vesta Modular, Brekke Storage, Dixie Storage and Inland Leasing acquisitions, and capital needs for the tax obligations arising from the divestiture of Adler Tanks.

Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets.  During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from borrowings.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into a merger agreement with WillScot Mobile Mini, which was subsequently terminated, resulting in proceeds received of $116.8 million, net of transaction costs, which were primarily used to paydown outstanding borrowings on bank lines of credit.  Comparatively, in 2023 the Company sold its Adler Tanks business, generating a total of $202.7 million in net proceeds, which were primarily used to expand the Company's rental asset fleet through the purchase of Vesta Modular.  These types of transactions are considered nonrecurring to the Company and not a normal part of continuing operations.  Sales of rental equipment occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses.  However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding.  Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock.

As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.

In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company has periodically made acquisitions of businesses and business assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company transacted a total of $462.1 million in acquisition related costs.  There were no acquisition related transactions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, respectively.  The Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $40.2 million in 2024, $44.0 million in 2023 and $17.6 million in 2022, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends.  The Company paid cash dividends of $46.8 million, $45.6 million and $44.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In September 2024, the Company's Board of Directors increased the capacity under the share repurchase program by authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the "Repurchase Plan"), an increase from the 1,309,805 remaining shares authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan established in August 2015.  The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased, and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time.  There were no shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  As of December 31, 2024, 2,000,000 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.

Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit

On July 15, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”).  The Credit Facility provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $950.0 million, of which as of December 31, 2024, $73.0 million was utilized through the term loan entered on April 23, 2024, by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $40.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.  The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.  The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $20.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due July 15, 2027, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended): (i) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022, (ii) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2021 and due March 17, 2028, and (iii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued June 16, 2021 and due June 16, 2026. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on July 15, 2027 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2020 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on April 23, 2022.

On August 19, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $20.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”).  The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of July 15, 2027, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services.  The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 30, 2020.

On April 23, 2024, the Company entered into a first incremental facility amendment with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and the first incremental lender (“BoA”) and the guarantors named therein (the “First Incremental Amendment”).  The First Incremental Amendment amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 15, 2022, as amended, by and among the Company, BoA, the other lenders named therein, and the guarantors named therein (the “Credit Agreement”) to institute an incremental term loan “A” facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the “Incremental Credit Facility”).  The proceeds from the Incremental Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes. Concurrently with entry into the First Incremental Amendment, the Company repaid revolving loans issued under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $75.0 million.

At December 31, 2024, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $650.0 million of which $342.4 million was outstanding and had the capacity to borrow up to an additional

-

-

$307.6 million.  The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):

•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 3.19 to 1.

•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 1.68 to 1.

At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants.  There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants.

Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement

On June 8, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series D and Series E Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement.  The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA.  Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.57% Series D Senior Notes, due March 17, 2028, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.35% Series E Senior Notes, due June 16, 2026, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply.

In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $300 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series D Senior Notes, Series E Senior Notes and Series F Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement.  Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers.  The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note.

6.25% Senior Notes Due in 2030

On September 27, 2023, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Series F Notes (the “Series F Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated June 8, 2023 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

The Series F Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum and mature on September 27, 2030.  Interest on the Series F Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on March 27, 2024 and continuing thereafter on September 27 and March 27 of each year until maturity.  The principal balance is due when the notes mature on September 27, 2030. The full net proceeds from the Series F Senior Notes were primarily used to fulfill the income tax obligations incurred from the divestiture of Adler Tanks.  At December 31, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Series F Senior Notes was $75.0 million.

2.57% Senior Notes Due in 2028

On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57% Series D Notes (the “Series D Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

The Series D Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.57% per annum and mature on March 17, 2028.  Interest on the Series D Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2021 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity.  The principal balance is due when the notes mature on March 17, 2028.  The full net proceeds from the Series D Senior Notes were used to pay off the Company’s $40.0 million Series B Senior Notes.  At December 31, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Series D Senior Notes was $40.0 million.

2.35% Senior Notes Due in 2026

On June 16, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% Series E Notes (the "Series E Notes") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

The Series E Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.35% per annum and mature on June 16, 2026.  Interest on the Series E Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 16, 2021 and continuing thereafter on June 16 and December 16 of each year until maturity.  The principal balance is due when the notes mature on June 16, 2026.  The full net proceeds from the Series E Senior Notes were used to pay down the Company’s credit facility.  At December 31, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Series E Senior Notes was $60.0 million.

Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the  Series D Senior Notes, Series E Senior Notes and Series F Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):

•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 3.19 to 1.

•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 1.68 to 1.

At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants.  There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants.

Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

At December 31, 2024, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2027, outstanding amounts under our 2.35%, 2.57% and 6.25% senior notes due in 2026, 2028 and 2030, respectively, and operating leases for facilities.  The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance.  The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2024 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.

The Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2025 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings.

Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 63 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective assumptions, estimates, and/or judgment.  Material changes in these assumptions, estimates or judgments could have the potential to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company has identified below the accounting policies that it believes could potentially have a material impact on operating results if a change in assumption, estimate and/or judgment were to occur.

-
50
-

Depreciation -
 The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products.  Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness.

The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation.  For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand.  Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies.  For portable storage containers, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, the quality of the steel construction, types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses.  Internal factors for portable storage containers may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies.  For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand.  Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies.

To the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to decrease or increase by one year, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease by approximately $5.0 million.  If the estimated residual values of all of our rental equipment were to change one percentage point, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would change by approximately $1.0 million. Any changes in depreciation expense as a result of a change in useful lives or residual values would result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit the Company would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the equipment.

Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - 
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment.  Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized.  The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as portable storage office conversions, restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades.  In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. The Company capitalized $17.0 million in extended life or value added refurbishments in 2024. Changes in these policies to expense these costs as incurred could impact the Company’s financial results.

Acquisition Accounting
 - The Company has made acquisitions of businesses in the past and records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  Long-lived assets (primarily rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of the Company’s acquisitions.  Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data.  The intangible assets acquired are primarily comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names.  These assets are valued on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins, projected cash flows, discount rates, customer attrition rates, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information.  When appropriate, the Company’s estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms.  Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact the Company’s financial results in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future.  As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments.

Impairment of rental equipment - 
The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation.  To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value.  The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  Determining fair value includes estimates and judgments regarding the projected net cash flows considering current and future market conditions including assumptions regarding utilization, rental pricing, the condition of the equipment, the equipment’s expected remaining life and sale proceeds.  Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations.

Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
 - The Company’s goodwill is not amortized to expense, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. These impairment assessments occur annually, or more frequently if an event occurs, or circumstances change in the interim that would indicate that it was more likely than not the fair value had reduced below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment assessment requires judgement including the identification

-
51
-

of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, business projections including changes in pricing, rental and sale activity and costs, long term growth rates and discount rates.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company performed qualitative assessments taking into consideration the market value of the Company, any changes in management, key personnel, strategy and any relevant macroeconomic conditions, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting units carrying value, including goodwill.

Intangible assets (other than goodwill) acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Definite lived intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized.  The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests these assets for potential impairment annually and whenever management determines events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Revenue recognition:

Lease revenue
 - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments.  Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned.  Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and portable storage container leases.  For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer.  These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases.  For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment.  Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.

Non-lease revenue
 - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers.  The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete.  Revenue from contracts that satisfy the criteria for over-time recognition are recognized as work is performed by using the input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contract costs for each contract.  For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract.  The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Judgment is involved in determining the performance obligations and standalone selling prices.  To the extent actual results were to differ from these estimates, the timing of profit recognition could change and impact the Company’s financial results.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 2.35%, 2.57% and 6.25% senior notes due in 2026, 2028 and 2030, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit.  Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2024.  The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities.  The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company’s Series E, Series D and Series F Senior Notes and the Company’s revolving lines of credit under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility as of December 31, 2024.

The Company formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., in 2004 in conjunction with the TRS acquisition and a wholly owned Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited, in 2013.  The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017.  The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the

financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates).  Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.  In 2024, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant.

The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk.

Management’s Report on Internal C
ontrol over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments.  All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.

The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values.  Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters.  The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Basis for opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

McGrath RentCorp

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Change in accounting principle

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted new accounting guidance in 2024 related to the disclosure of segment information in accordance with ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The adoption was retrospectively applied to 2023 and 2022.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

MCGRATH RENTCORP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979.  The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with 
three
 rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business.  At December 31, 2024, the Company was comprised of 
four
 reportable business segments: modular building segment ("Mobile Modular"), portable storage container segment (“Portable Storage”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”).
Mutual decision to terminate Merger Agreement with WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.
As previously disclosed, on January 28, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("WillScot Mobile Mini”), Brunello Merger Sub I, Inc., a California corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of WillScot Mobile Mini, and Brunello Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of WillScot Mobile Mini.  On September 17, 2024, the Company and WillScot Mobile Mini mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, effective upon WillScot Mobile Mini's cash payment of $
180.0
 million to the Company, which was received on September 20, 2024.
Transaction costs attributed to the Merger Agreement are reported in the Company's Corporate segment.  Expenses recognized as a result of the terminated merger during year ended December 31, 2024, were $
63.2
 million.  The termination payment received of $
180.0
 million, net of transaction costs, resulted in net proceeds received of $
116.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company determined that the transaction costs incurred on the terminated merger were significant and required separate presentation on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Due to this determination, the Company has excluded such transaction costs from Selling and administrative expenses and reported them separately on the consolidated statements of income as non-operating expenses.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Lease revenues
 - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments.  Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned.  Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and portable storage container leases.  For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer.  These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases.  For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment.  Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.

Non-lease revenues
 - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers.  Revenue from contracts that satisfy the criteria for over-time recognition are recognized as work is performed by using the input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contract costs for each contract.  The majority of revenue for these contracts is derived from long-term projects which typically span multiple quarters.  The Company uses third parties to provide certain services as part of its contracts with customers. The Company is considered the principal (vs. an agent) as the Company is responsible for the fulfillment of all service elements and risks associated with the underlying performance obligation. Revenue for these services is recognized on a gross basis.
Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services.
Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses.

-
63
-

Depreciation of Rental Equipment
Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes.  The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings and portable storage containers are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows:

Relocatable modular buildings

18
 years, 
50
% residual value

Relocatable modular accessories

3

Portable storage containers

 years
, 
62.5
% residual value

Electronic test equipment and accessories

1
 to 
8
 years
, 
no
 residual value

Costs of Rental Related Services
Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and portable storage container leases. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery.  Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Costs of rental related services associated with portable storage containers consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the containers.  These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment.  If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.  The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions.  Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred.  Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset.  There were 
no
 impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations
Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale.
Warranty Reserves
Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold.  The Company typically provides limited 
90
-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex.  Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant.
Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials

 and work-in-process.  Inventories are measured at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value

 for acquired units and estimated standard costs for manufactured units.  Net realizable value is defined as the value for which an asset can be sold, less the estimated costs of selling such asset.  The costs include expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, manufacturing, production costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition

.

-

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes.  Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment from continuing operations consist of the following:

9.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Construction in progress at December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land and land improvements.  For information on the property, plant and equipment from discontinued operations, refer to 
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software.  Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred.  Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.  These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software.  Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred.  The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality.  Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment.  There were 
no
 capitalized internal use software costs during the year ended December 31, 2024, and the Company capitalized $
0.2
 million in internal use software during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Shipping Costs
The Company includes third party costs to deliver rental equipment to customers in costs of rental related services and costs of sales.

Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Total advertising expenses were $
6.2
 million, $
5.9
 million and $
5.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse.  Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities.  A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods.  To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

-
65
-

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates.  Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, goodwill and trade name intangible assets from continuing operations which have indefinite lives totaled $
323.4
 million for both periods.  For information on goodwill and trade name intangible assets from discontinued operations, refer to
 Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely.  The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment.  If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.  Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results.
The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired.  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired.  If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2024.  The impairment analysis did 
no
t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2024.  There were 
no
 impairment charges in 2023 or 2022.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities.  
The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:

no
 shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In September 2024, the Company's Board of Directors increased the capacity under the share repurchase program by authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 
2,000,000
 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the "Repurchase Plan"), an increase from the 
1,309,805
 remaining 
shares authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan established in August 2015.  The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased, and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the

Company’s 
Board of Directors at any time.  In the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 there were 
no
 shares of common stock repurchased.  As of December 31, 2024, 
2,000,000
 shares remain authorized for repurchase. 

Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement.  Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $
69.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
59.5
 million at December 31, 2023.  The Company sells primarily on 
30
-day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified.  The Company records an allowance for credit losses in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable.  The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts.  Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for credit losses when an account is determined to be uncollectable.  The allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues.  The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company’s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.  The Company recognized credit losses of $
1.9
 million, $
2.6
 million and $
0.8
 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The allowance for credit losses was $
2.9
 million, $
2.8
 million and $
2.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable.  From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.

Net Investment in Sales-Type Leases
The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its rental equipment, primarily at its Mobile Modular and TRS-RenTelco operating segments.  Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 
12
 to 
36 months
 and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying rental asset.  The net investment in sales-type leases was $
6.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
3.7
 million at December 31, 2023.  The Company’s assessment of current expected losses on these receivables was not material and 
no
 credit loss expense was provided as of December 31, 2024.  The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience, the age of the lease receivable balances, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.  Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice.  The Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases, on an ongoing basis, using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:  historical payment history, credit score, size of operations, length of time in business, industry, historical profitability, historical cash flows, liquidity and past due amounts.  The Company uses credit scores obtained from external credit bureaus as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality of its new customers.  The Company does not own available for sale debt securities or other financial assets at December 31, 2024.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $
169.4
 million and $
169.2
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to the recorded value of $
175.0
 million in both periods.  The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation
The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada.  The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur.
The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017.  The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee.  All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year.
Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values.  The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant.  The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when it is probable that vesting conditions will be met.  In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. 

The Company recognizes forfeitures based on actual forfeitures when they occur.  The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized.  Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 10.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite and indefinite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for credit losses.  In addition, determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in a business or asset acquisition can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions.

NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, 
Income Taxes—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (Topic 740), which will require Companies to disclose annually the specific categories in income tax rate reconciliations, provide additional information for reconciling items which meet a quantitative threshold, and disaggregate domestic and foreign income or loss from continuing operations. Additionally, this ASU will also require the disclosure of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and applied on a prospective basis.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of this ASU.

NOTE 3. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective December 15, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (Topic 280), which requires public companies to provide more transparency in both quarterly and annual reports about the expenses they incur from revenue generating reportable business segments.  In addition, the ASU requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, an amount for other segment items by reportable business segment, including a description of its composition, and the primary measures of a business segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance.  The adoption of this new guidance resulted in changes to "Note 16. Segment Reporting" to the consolidated financial statements, impacting the presentation and disclosure of the Company's four reportable business segments.
Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-01, 
Leases
 (Topic 842): 
Common Control Arrangements
, 
which requires a lessee involved in a common control lease agreement to amortize leasehold improvements over the useful life of the improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset.  If

-
68
-

the 
lessor obtains the right to control the use of the underlying asset through a lease with another entity not within the same control group, the amortization period cannot exceed the period of the common control group. Furthermore, the ASU requires the accounting for a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset.  The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS
On February 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Vesta Housing Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“Vesta Modular”), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Indus
tries, for $
437.2
 million cash consideration on the closing date, which included certain adjustments, including net working capital and certain qualified capital expenditures.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company purchased a representation and warranty insurance policy to provide certain recourse in the event of breaches of representations and warranties of Vesta Modular and the seller of Vesta Modular under the stock purchase agreement.  Vesta Modular was a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions serving customers between its modular leasing and modular construction divisions.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, 
Business Combinations
, using the purchase method of accounting.  Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values on the closing date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.  The financial results of Vesta Modular were a part of the Mobile Modular segment since February 1, 2023, including $
7.7
 million of acquisition related transaction costs incurred during the current year as a result of the acquisition.

On March 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Jerald R. Brekke, Inc., DBA Brekke Storage ("Brekke Storage"), for a total purchase price of $
16.4
 million.  Brekke Storage was a regional provider of portable storage solutions in the Colorado market.  The acquisition expanded the Portable Storage fleet by approximately 
2,700
 units and provided a new regional operation to serve the Colorado market. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 using the purchase method of accounting.  The financial results of Brekke Storage were a part of the Portable Storage segment since March 1, 2023, including $
0.2
 million of transaction costs.
On April 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Dixie Temporary Storage, LLC ("Dixie Storage"), for a purchase price of $
4.9
 million.  Dixie Storage was a regional provider of portable storage solutions in the South Carolina market and is highly complementary to the Company's Portable Storage business segment.  The acquisition expanded the Portable Storage fleet by approximately 
800
 units and provided a new regional operation to serve the South Carolina market.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 using the purchase method of accounting.  The financial results of Dixie Storage were a part of the Portable Storage segment since April 1, 2023, including $
0.1
 million of transaction costs.
On July 1, 2023, the Company completed the purchase of assets of Inland Leasing and Storage, LLC ("Inland Leasing"), for a purchase price of $
3.8
 million.  Inland Leasing was a regional provider of portable storage solutions in the Colorado market and is highly complementary to the Company's Portable Storage business segment.  The acquisition grew the Portable Storage fleet by approximately 
600
 units, which will further support the Colorado market.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of "assets" in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 and the assessment of the fair value of the purchased assets was allocated primarily to rental equipment totaling $
3.0
 million and intangible assets totaling $
0.7
 million. Supplemental pro forma information has not been provided as the historical financial results of Inland Leasing were not significant.  Incremental transaction costs associated with the asset purchase were not significant.
The following tables summarize the purchase price allocations reflecting estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Vesta Modular, Brekke Storage and Dixie Storage business acquisitions, with excess amounts allocated to goodwill.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon their fair values on the closing date.  The valuation of intangible assets acquired is based on certain valuation assumptions including cash flow projections, discount rates, contributory asset charges and other valuation model inputs. The valuation of tangible long-lived assets acquired is dependent upon various analyses including an analysis of the condition and estimated remaining economic lives of the assets acquired.

The value assigned to identifiable intangible assets was determined based on discounted estimated future cash flows associated with such assets to their present value.  The combined acquired goodwill of $
216.8
 million reflects the strategic fit of Vesta Modular, Brekke Storage and Dixie Storage with the Company’s modular and portable storage business operations. The Company amortizes the acquired customer relationships over their expected useful lives of 
11
 years for Vesta Modular, 
8
 years for Brekke Storage and 
9
 years for Dixie Storage.  The expected useful life for the non-compete agreements is 
5
 years.  The trade name intangible acquired from the Vesta Modular acquisition was amortized over it's useful life of 
nine months
.  Goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and will be subject to future impairment testing.  The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over 
15
 years.

The following table reports the actual results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The pro forma financial information shows the combined results of continuing operations of the Company and Vesta Modular as if the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the period presented.  The pro forma results include the effects of the amortization of the purchased intangible assets and depreciation expense of acquired rental equipment valuation step up, interest expense on the debt incurred to finance the acquisitions.  A pro forma adjustment has been made to reflect the income taxes that would have been recorded at the combined federal and state statutory rate of

NOTE 5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On February 1, 2023, the Company completed the sale of Adler Tank Rentals, LLC to Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc. ("Ironclad"), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, for a sale price of $
268.0
 million.  The total transaction costs incurred from the divestiture was $
6.7
 million and $
2.1
 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The divestiture of the Company's Adler Tanks business represents the Company's strategic shift to concentrate its operations on its core modular and storage businesses. The sale price was subject to certain adjustments, including net working capital, certain qualified capital expenditures and certain transaction expenses to be borne by the Company.  In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a number of ancillary agreements, including an escrow agreement associated with net working capital adjustments, a restricted covenant agreement, a transition services agreement, and a number of leases whereby Ironclad or one of its affiliates would be a lessee to certain properties owned by the Company that the Adler Tanks business would continue to utilize after the sale. These ancillary agreements do not provide for continued involvement by the Company in Adler Tanks.  In accordance with ASC 205-20,

NOTE 6. LEASES
Lessee
The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations.  The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.
  Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material.  The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.  The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate.  If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.  Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised.  
These leases include one or more 
options to renew
, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from 
one
 to 
three years
.
  The amount of payments associated with such options is not material.  Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less.  The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities 
were
 $
12.6
 m
illi
on and $
14.8
 million, respectively, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, operating lease expense was $
6.4
 million and $
6.7
 million, respectively, 
wh
ich included short term lease expense of $
0.3
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 
3.5
 years and the weighted average discount rate was 
5.37
% and 
4.94
%, respectively.  The Company had 
no
 sub-lease income or finance leases during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Lessor
The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions.  The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement.  The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases.
  These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority.  The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options.  
Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from 
one
 to 
sixty months
.
  Customers have the 
option
 to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs.  All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately 
three
 to 
five years
.  The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory.  The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
As of December 31, 2024, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2025 and thereafter were as follows:

 million, 
consisting
 of $
589.3
 million of operating lease revenues 
and
 $
2.6
 million of finance lease revenues.  The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers.  The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term.  For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $
2.0
 million of sales revenues and $
0.6
 million of interest income.  
The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows:

NOTE 7. REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards.  The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, 
Leases
.   Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606).  The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.  The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete.  For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract.  The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.

Revenue from contracts that satisfy the criteria for over time recognition are recognized as work is performed by using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contract costs for each contract.  The majority of revenue for these contracts is derived from long-term projects which typically span 
multiple quarters
.  The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed contract receivables and contract assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.   In the Company’s contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones.  Billings can occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, or in advance, resulting in contract liabilities. These contract assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.  
The contract liabilities included in Deferred income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $
35.4
 million and $
40.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Sales revenues totaling $
35.4
 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2023.  For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, or revenue is recognizable prior to customer billing, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings.  These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $
13.0
 million and $
8.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The Company did not recognize any material contract asset impairments during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company's uncompleted contracts with customers which meet the criteria for over-time revenue recognition have unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
57.0
 million of revenue is expected to be recognized for unsatisfied or partially satisfied obligations.  
We expect to recognize revenue for approximately one half of these unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remaining balance recognized thereafter.
  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
267.4
 million of revenue was recognized for sales and non-lease services transferred at a point in time and approximately $
51.7
 million of revenue was recognized for sales and non-lease services transferred over time.

The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 
30
 day payment terms.  The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration.  Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment.  The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract.

Lease Revenues
Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments.  Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned.  Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and portable storage container leases.  For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer.  These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as

-
75
-

sales-type leases.  For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment.  Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.
Non-Lease Revenues
Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  For portable storage container and electronic test equipment leases, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues.

Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer.  Sales contracts that satisfy the criteria for over-time recognition are recognized as work is performed by using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contracts costs for each contract.  Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue.
Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses.
The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues from continuing operations by lease (within the scope of Topic 842) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended

Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed.  Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold.  The Company typically provides limited 
90
-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and 
one-year
 warranties 
on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex.  Although the Company’s

-
76
-

policy 
is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant.

The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases.  Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months.
Other Income, net
Other income, net consists of the net gain on sales of property, plant and equipment. These sales are generally recognized at a point in time, with contractually defined performance obligations that are typically transferred upon the closing date of the sale.  These types of sales are infrequent in occurrence and reported on the consolidated statements of income within the scope of ASC 610, 
Other Income
.  Proceeds to be received from the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit
On July 15, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”).  The Credit Facility provides for a $
650.0
 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $
950.0
 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $
40.0
 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $
20.0
 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $
20.0
 million Treasury Sweep Note due 
July 15, 2027
, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended): (i) the $
60.0
 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015,  which were repaid on 
November 5, 2022
, (ii) the $
40.0
 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2021 and due 
March 17, 2028
, and (iii) the $
60.0
 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued June 16, 2021 and due
 June 16, 2026
.  In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $
250.0
 million. The Credit Facility matures on 
July 15, 2027
 and replaced the Company’s prior $
420.0
 million credit facility dated March 31, 2020 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended.  All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on July 15, 2022.
On August 19, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $
20.0
 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”).  The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of 
July 15, 2027
, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services.  The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 30, 2020.
On April 23, 2024, the Company entered into a first incremental facility amendment with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and the first incremental lender (“BoA”) and the guarantors named therein (the “First Incremental Amendment”).  The First Incremental Amendment amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 15, 2022, as amended, by and among the Company, BoA, the other lenders named therein, and the guarantors named therein (the “Credit Agreement”) to institute an incremental term loan “A” facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
75.0
 million (the “Incremental Credit Facility”).  The proceeds from the Incremental Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes. Concurrently with entry into the First Incremental Amendment, the Company repaid revolving loans issued under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $
75.0
 million.

At December 31, 2024, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $
650.0
 million of which $
342.4
 million was outstanding and had the capacity to borrow up to an additional $
307.6
 million.  The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 
2.50
 to 1.  At December 31, 2024 the actual ratio was 
3.19
 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 
2.75
 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 
1.68
 to 1.
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either:  
(i) SOFR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin.  The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 
1.00
% to 
1.75
% for SOFR loans and 
0
% to 
0.75
% for base rate loans.  In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $
650.0
 million credit facility that is not used.  These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 
0.15
% to 
0.30
%.  As o
f December 31, 2024 and 2023, the applicable margins were 
1.25
% for SOFR based loans, 
0.25
% for base rate loans and 
0.20
%
 for unused fees.  Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $
20.0
 million facility not used.

The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility.

 million.
 Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 
2.50
 to 1.  At December 31, 2024, the actual ratio was 
3.19

The Company's tax loss carryforwards for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $
33.7
 million and $
16.7
 million for federal and state jurisdictions, respectively, which are expected to result in a future federal and state tax benefit of $
7.1
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively.  The availability of these tax losses to offset future income varies by jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the ability to utilize the tax losses may be subject to additional limitations.  The Company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period.  The Company’s state net operating loss carryforwards have differing carryforward periods.  The Company anticipates that the available net operating losses as of December 31, 2024, will be utilized prior to their respective expiration dates.

In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division.  The wind down of operations in India began in 2017.  As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $
0.6
 million.  These loss carry forwards have expired at the end of 
2024
 and the associated deferred tax assets and valuation allowance have been removed.

For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant.  The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $
0.9
 million, $
2.7
 million and $
2.6
 million, respectively.

The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.  For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50
 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
  The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were 
no
 material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions.  Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2020.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.  Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

NOTE 10. BENEFIT PLANS
Stock Plans
The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 
2,000,000
 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remained available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants.  The equity awards have a maximum term of 
7
 years at an exercise price of not less than 
100
% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted.  The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan.

The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits.  Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by 
two
 shares.  There were no significant modifications to the 2016 Plan or awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2024.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the share-based compensation expense was $
9.5
 million, $
8.3
 million and $
8.0
 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $
2.6
 million, $
2.2
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses.  There was 
no
 capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

No
 forfeitures are currently expected.  The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 based on the weighted average grant date values was $
11.1
 million, $
8.6
 million and $
9.3

Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
9.5
 million, $
8.3
 million and $
7.9
 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $
10.9

The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock.  The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was less than $
0.1
 million, $
9.4
 million and $
7.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise.  As of December 31, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans.

The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements.  Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

No
 options were granted in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans
The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit.  Each employee who has at least 
two months
 of service with the Company and is 
21
 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP.  The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions.  Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors.  Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 dividends deducted by the Company were $
0.4
 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $
0.1
 million in 2024.
At December 31, 2024, the KSOP held 
233,270
 shares, or

1
% of the Company’s total common shares outstanding.  These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

NOTE 11. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. In September 2024, the Company's Board of Directors increased the capacity under the share repurchase program by authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 
2,000,000
 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the "Repurchase Plan"), an increase from the 
1,309,805
 remaining shares authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan established in August 2015.  The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased, and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time.  There were 
no
 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  As of December 31, 2024, 
2,000,000
 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases.  Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value.  In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases.  
Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as 
follows:

The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience.  The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances.  The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control.  In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company.
The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $
225,000
 per claim.  Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $
350,000
 for prior claim years.  Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis.  In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate.  The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end.  The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates.  A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued.  In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops.  All of these factors have the potential to impact the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $
1.7
 million and $
1.6
 million, respectively.

The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely.  The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment.  If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.  The amount of an impairment loss that would be recognized is the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.  Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The Company last conducted a qualitative analysis of its goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter 2024, with 
no
 indicators of impairment.  In addition, 
no
 impairment 
triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Determining fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  The

-
86
-

Company 
bases its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives.  Amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
10.3
 million, $
10.7
 million and $
5.9
 million, respectively.  Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2024 and assuming 
no
 subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $
10.2
 million in 2025, $
9.8
 million in 2026, $
9.6
 million in 2027, $
8.2

million in 2028 and $
4.7
 million in 2029.  For information on intangible assets from discontinued operations refer to 
Note 5.

NOTE 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
There were 
no
 significant related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates.

NOTE 16. SEGMENT REPORTING
During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that its Portable Storage business segment met the criteria for separate recognition as defined in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280, 
Segment Reporting
.  The guidance under this topic requires a public business entity to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative thresholds to determine the significance of a business segment and whether the separate reporting of a business segment enhances the users' understanding of the reporting entity's performance, future net cash flows and judgments.  The Company evaluated the guidance within Topic 280 and made its determination to separately report the Portable Storage segment primarily due to the Company's continued growth in container fleet purchases and related increased revenues and improved profitability performance when compared to previously reported periods.  In addition to this determination, the Company also divested its Adler Tanks business segment during the year ended December 31, 2023.  Additional information regarding the divestiture of Adler Tanks can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers.  In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s 
four
 reportable segments are Mobile Modular, Portable Storage, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex.  
The Company's 
Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM")
 Joe Hanna, Chief Executive Officer, and management  focus on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental, rental related services and sales revenue growth, segment profit, and income before provision for income taxes.
  In addition to the evaluation of the aforementioned key measures of each reportable segment, the CODM and management evaluate supplemental information by reportable segment such as rental equipment acquisitions, fleet utilization, and average utilization to further assess segment performance and the future allocation of Company resources.  Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, Portable Storage and TRS-RenTelco, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues.  Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, Portable Storage and TRS-RenTelco based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits.  The Company does not report total assets by business segment.

Summarized financial information from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables:

ITEM 9.	CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.

ITEM 9A.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company.  Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.  The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level.

Management’s Assessment of Internal Control.
 Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 55.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
