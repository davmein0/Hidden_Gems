ITEM 1.	BUSINESS.

General Overview

McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”.  References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.

The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with three rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment.  Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business.  At December 31, 2024, the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its portable storage container segment (“Portable Storage”); (3) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”).

Mutual decision to terminate Merger Agreement with WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp

As previously disclosed, on January 28, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("WillScot Mobile Mini”), Brunello Merger Sub I, Inc., a California corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of WillScot Mobile Mini, and Brunello Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of WillScot Mobile Mini.  On September 17, 2024, the Company and WillScot Mobile Mini mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, effective upon WillScot Mobile Mini's cash payment of $180.0 million to the Company, which was received on September 20, 2024.

Transaction costs attributed to the Merger Agreement are reported in the Company's Corporate segment.  Expenses recognized as a result of the terminated Merger Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024, were $63.2 million.  The termination payment received of $180.0 million, net of transaction costs, resulted in net proceeds received of $116.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company determined that the transaction costs incurred on the terminated merger were significant and required separate presentation on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Due to this determination, the Company has excluded such transaction costs from Selling and administrative expenses and reported these costs separately on the consolidated statements of income as non-operating expenses.

Business Model

The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life.  When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth.  The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics:

•
The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative.

•
Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products.  The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership.

•
All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term.  Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, portable storage containers ("containers") have an estimated life of twenty-five years compared to a typical rental term of three to twelve months and electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months.

•
We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment.  For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately four years, in approximately three years for containers and approximately three years for electronic test equipment.

•
When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered.  Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory.  Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale.  Container asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality products and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments.  Steel containers have no technical obsolescence.  Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. 

The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses.  Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back-office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems.

Human Capital Management

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 1,219 employees, of whom 142 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 687, 177, 133 and 80 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Portable Storage, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.

The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth.  The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s employees.  The Company provides training in technical, operational and leadership skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development.  Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement.

RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS

Description

Modulars are designed for use as classrooms, temporary offices adjacent to existing facilities, sales offices, construction field offices, restroom buildings, health care clinics, child care facilities, office space and for a variety of other purposes and may be moved from one location to another.  Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes.  The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes.  The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available.  The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities.

Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications.   During 2024, Mobile Modular purchased 18% of its new modular units from one manufacturer.  The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity.

The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs.  Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades.  The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future.

Mobile Modular operates from regional sales and inventory centers serving large geographic areas.  These sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity.  The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base.  Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost.  When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental.  By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment.  Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age.  Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 16 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value.

Competitive Strengths

Strong Industry Position
 – Mobile Modular has a leading modular building fleet in the United States. Rental units for temporary classroom and other educational space needs are an important industry segment and the Company believes Mobile Modular is a leading supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools.  Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements.

Expertise 
– The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that delivers value to customers.  Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units.  Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service.  Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications.

Operating Structure 
–

Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that allow it to drive greater efficiency and pass the benefits to customers.  Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction.  The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs.

Asset Management
 – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet.  In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry.  The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life

to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance.  Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases.

Customer Service
 - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based.  The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience.  Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units.  Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency.  The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business.

Market

Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion.  Mobile Modular’s largest business segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below).  Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities.  Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs.  Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital.  The Company’s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units.

Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is primarily on rentals rather than sales.  Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing.  Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application.

Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units.  On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service.

Rentals

Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type.  Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions.  Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular.

The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization.  Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent.  Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear.  Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs.  The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment.

At December 31, 2024, Mobile Modular owned 41,299 new or previously rented modulars, with an aggregate cost of $1,414.4 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $34,247.  Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment.  At December 31, 2024, fleet utilization was 75.1% and average fleet utilization during 2024 was 77.5%.

Sales

In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers.  These sales may arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent or from specific requests for new buildings for a permanent need.

The Company has a dedicated team that focuses on these custom sale opportunities.  Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units.  During 2024 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 5% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 4% of the Company’s consolidated sales and 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.

Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers.  Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs.  However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future.

Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions.

Seasonality

Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year.  The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions.

Competition

Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense.  Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have.  In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country and have a stronger local presence in those places.  Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, the Pacific Northwest, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate.  The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense.  Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage.  Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units.  Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations.  The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars.

Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)

Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities.  Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues.   Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, the Pacific Northwest, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market.  Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes.  The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past three years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute:

Storage containers are made from weather-resistant corrugated steel and are 8 feet wide and available in lengths ranging from 8 to 53 feet, with 20-foot and 40-foot length containers being the most common.

•
Office containers are either modified or specifically manufactured containers that provide self-contained office space with maximum design flexibility.  Office containers are often referred to as ground level offices (“GLOs”). GLOs provide the advantage of ground level accessibility and high security.

Competitive Strengths

Strong Industry Position
 - The Company believes that Portable Storage is one of the largest participants in the temporary portable storage rental industry in North America.  Portable Storage has a national reach from branches serving the West, Pacific Northwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest.

Expertise and Customer Service
 – The Company believes that Portable Storage has highly experienced operating management and branch employees.  The Company believes that Portable Storage provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills, quality of fleet, driver development program and the quality of its responsiveness.

Asset Management
 – The Company believes that Portable Storage markets high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental products.  The Company depreciates its containers over a 25-year estimated useful life to 62.5% residual value.  We believe that if maintained, older containers will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment.  The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitors’ product availability and expected equipment returns.

Market

The portable storage container rental market in the U.S. has a large and diverse number of market segments including construction, retail, commercial and industrial, energy and petrochemical, manufacturing, education and healthcare.

The container rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards.

Rentals

Portable Storage rents its storage and office containers typically for rental periods of one to twelve months, although in some instances, rental terms can be over a year or longer.  Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 4% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost.  At December 31, 2024, Portable Storage owned 41,888 containers with an aggregate cost of $240.8 million or an average cost per unit of $5,750.  Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new and accessory equipment.  Utilization was 59.8% at December 31, 2024 and averaged 64.9% during the year.

Seasonality

Rental activity may vary depending upon the extent of retail activity that typically occurs during the fourth quarter and the impact inclement weather may have on construction activity.

Competition

The portable storage container rental industry is highly competitive.  Some of our competitors may be larger than we are, have greater financial and other resources than we have, are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do.  Portable Storage also competes against local companies that may have longer operating histories and a strong local presence. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates.  Portable Storage competes with these companies based upon product

in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests.  TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists.  TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business.

Market

Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion.  There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies.

TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries.  TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns.  A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements.

The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons.  Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime.  Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously.  The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints.

Rentals

TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer.  Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price.  TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value.

At December 31, 2024, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $344.0 million.  Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment.  Utilization was 58.6% as of December 31, 2024 and averaged 57.3% during the year.

Sales

Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings.  Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 21% to 27% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division.  For 2024, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 27% of total division gross profit.  Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities.  In 2024, approximately 20% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales.  The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2024 represented 3% of electronic test equipment sales, less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues.  There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers.  We believe the annual world-wide sales of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year.

Seasonality

Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February.  These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter.  These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter.

Competition

The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do.  TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability.  Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market.  Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options.
