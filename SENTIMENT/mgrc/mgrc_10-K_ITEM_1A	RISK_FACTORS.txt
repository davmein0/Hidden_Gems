ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties.  We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us.  Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize.  In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS:

Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.

Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors.  Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to:

•
general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products;

•
legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products;

•
the budgetary constraints of our customers;

•
seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets;

•
success of our strategic growth initiatives;

•
costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses;

•
the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales;

•
the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers;

•
the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors;

•
the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment;

•
supply chain delays or disruptions;

•
our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing;

•
inflation in the cost of materials, labor and new rental equipment;

•
the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets;

•
rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment;

•
movements in interest rates or tax rates;

•
changes in, and application of, accounting rules;

•
changes in the law and regulations applicable to our business operations; and

•
claims and litigation matters.

As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price.

Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock.

The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to:

•
our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations;

•
any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets;

•
investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC;

•
the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies;

-
14
-

•
any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry;

•
any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock;

•
any merger, acquisition or divestiture activity that involves us or our competitors; and

•
other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors.

In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.  These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.  Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations.  These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price.

Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business.

If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer.  We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel.  Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs.  Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel.

Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition.

We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers.  In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products.  Although in general, we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier.  We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers.  Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products.  In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms.  If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed.

We are subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security which could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business.

We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021.  Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations.  The attack did not result in any material disruption to our operations or ability to service our customers and did not affect our financial performance.

In the future, we could experience additional breaches of our security measures resulting in the theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, additional data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.

Any future breaches could subject us to reputational damage. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect.  We expend significant resources to minimize the risk of security breaches, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees annually, and engaging third-party experts and contractors. Significant and increasing investments of time and resources by management and Board have been, and will continue to be, required to anticipate and address cybersecurity risks and incidents.  However, given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, and often are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures in time to stop a cyber incident.  Thus, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent future breaches in our systems

-
15
-

(or that of our third-party providers). Such breaches could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties.

Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations.

Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions.  We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems, but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network.  Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations.  Any future cybersecurity attack causing disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner.

As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers.  In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws.

Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results.

We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.

We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans.  We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:

•
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;

•
diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business;

•
difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;

•
regulatory hurdles in completing the transaction;

•
difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business;

•
timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;

•
an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;

•
undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition;

•
negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition;

•
disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale;

•
loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees;

•
an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates;

•
recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;

•
incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and

•
becoming subject to litigation.

-
16
-

Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent and future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.  The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business.  The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel.  In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly.  If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility.  If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders.  In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.

We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.

A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the assets to be divested from the assets that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures.  These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.  In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business.  Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources.  Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.

At December 31, 2024, we had $377.6 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations.  Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value.  Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results.

Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.

The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:

•
the market price for new equipment of a like kind;

•
the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;

•
the supply of used equipment on the market;

•
technological advances relating to the equipment;

•
worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and

•
general economic conditions.

We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment.  Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years.  If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in credit losses relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher credit losses. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment.  If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels.  If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business.  If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our modular, containers and electronics rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses.  Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modulars and containers.  Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices.  Container asset management requires obtaining high quality, well-constructed products and repairing and maintaining the products to ensure its long life.  For each of our modular, container and electronic test equipment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws.  Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, hazardous substance handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety.  These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change.  We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws.  We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites.  These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances.

Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability.  For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles.  The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable.  Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material.  In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations.

Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property.  In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims.  Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency.  Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent.  Such proceedings are

-
18
-

invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims.  We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country.  Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence.

The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation.

Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.  If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed.  Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources.  In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law.  We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies.

If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results.

Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters.  In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake.  Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms.  In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance.  We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business.  We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism.  If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS:

Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated, and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments.

The agreements governing our Series D, E and F Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business.  In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt.  In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments.  These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.

A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.  In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments.  If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income.

Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates.  At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows.  Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $4.2 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $415.4 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2024.  If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected.

SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS AND PORTABLE STORAGE BUSINESS SEGMENTS:

Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability.

Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues.  Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets.  Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand.  Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business.

The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals.  The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market.  A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.  Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner.

To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted.  We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products.  Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income.

Various states where we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom.  School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms.  In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms.  The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements.  If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate.  Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Additionally, declining public school enrollment could lead to decreased demand for our products and services.

Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, which can change from time to time, governing construction, environmental health and safety, labor and employment, government contracts, transportation, immigration, anti-corruption, anti-trust and privacy, among others. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows.

Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental,

-
20
-

zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations.

As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied.  Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations.

Building codes are generally reviewed every three years.  All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits.

Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation.  These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets.  The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s.  When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation.  If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts.  These laws and regulations expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, potential early termination of contracts, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. Furthermore, these laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.

Mobile Modular and Portable Storage derive a portion of its revenues from contracts with U.S. federal government entities, government prime contractors, state entities and local entities, including school districts.  Contracts with government entities are subject to budgetary constraints, and our continued performance under our contracts with these agencies and their prime contractors, or award of additional contracts from these agencies or their prime contractors, could be jeopardized by spending reductions or budget cutbacks at these agencies.  Such contracts are also subject to unique laws and regulations, and the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to government contracting or changes to existing laws or regulations.  New laws, regulations or procurement requirements, or changes to current ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability.  In addition, any failure on the part of the company to comply with applicable government contract laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the termination or suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues, which would harm our business.

Furthermore, the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts.  For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding.  Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business.  The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts.  As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety.  A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly.  In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations.

Expansions of our modular and portable storage operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results.

In the past we have expanded our modular and portable storage operations into new geographies and states.  There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion.  In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions.  Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of

-

attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results.

Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our modular building business.

A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market.  Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions.  Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business.

We face strong competition in our modular building and portable storage markets and we may not be able to effectively compete.

The modular building and portable storage leasing industries are highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so.  The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers.  We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment and labor availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms.  We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.

Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry have greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have.  These competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building and portable storage container markets, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business.

We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular and container units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet.

As of December 31, 2024, 63% of our modular and 57% of our container portfolios had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term.  Generally, when a customer continues to rent the units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis.  If a significant number of our rented units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed.  Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet.  In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them.

Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability.

We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units.  The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.  Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet.  We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our drivers and subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of driver and subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance.  During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability.

Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition.

We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications.  With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company.  During 2024, Mobile Modular purchased 18% of its modular product from one manufacturer.  The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity.

Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows.

We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50% and containers to be 25 years with a residual value of 62.5%.  However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the products during our ownership is required for the product to reach their useful lives and residual values.  If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand.  In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers.  Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows.

Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income.

Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold.  We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary.  Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely.  If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims.  Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income.

SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT:

Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows.

TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries.  Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance.  Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges.  During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.

Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results.

Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February.  These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter.  These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods.

Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge.

Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers.

Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers.   This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge.  We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers.  Failure to properly select, manage and respond to

-
23
-

the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows.

If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected.

The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market.  We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers.  We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability.  Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options.  Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation.

The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers.  We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.

Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business within the U.S. and internationally, related to government contracts, immigration, export control, anti-corruption, anti-trust, privacy, environmental health and safety, labor and employment, among others. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. More specifically, if we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues.  In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue.   Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including:

•
international political, economic and legal conditions including political unrest and conflict, sanctions, tariffs and trade barriers;

•
our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, under U.S. and applicable foreign laws, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations;

•
greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables;

•
additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations;

•
difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally;

•
language and cultural barriers;

•
seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located;

•
difficulty with the integration of foreign operations;

•
longer payment cycles;

•
currency fluctuations; and

•
potential adverse tax consequences.

Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms.

We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada.  Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net

-

-

receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished.  This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results.  We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.

GENERAL RISKS:

Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable.

We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses.  Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward.  Further, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities.  In addition, the amount and timing of stock-based compensation may also impact the Company’s current tax provision.

Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations.

Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions.  New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.  Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally, as well as geopolitical tensions, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United States and globally, including inflation, cost increases from tariffs, slower than expected growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tightening of the credit markets, higher interest rates and currency fluctuations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.  These factors could negatively affect demand for our business.

Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in our industry and in the markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations.  Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to refinance debt.

Furthermore, sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, geopolitical tensions, including further escalation of war between Russia and Ukraine, further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, further escalation in the conflict between the State of Israel and Hamas, as well as further escalation of tensions between the State of Israel and various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade.  Any or all of these factors could negatively affect our revenue and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business and reputation.

Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees have sensitivities to ESG concerns.  Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more environmentally friendly products, supplier practices, or by failure to meet such customer expectations or demand.  We risk negative shareholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our reputation, if we do not act responsibly, or if we are perceived to not be acting responsibly in key ESG areas.  If we do not meet the ESG expectations of our investors, customers and other stakeholders, we could experience reduced demand for our products, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on our business and results of operations.

We have begun to report our prior modular building and portable storage segment in two separate segments of modular building and portable storage container. This segment reporting structure has been in effect for a limited period of time, and there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully operate the prior segment in two distinct segments, and the change could be confusing to investors and may not have the desired effects.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we began reporting our prior modular building and portable storage segment as two distinct segments of modular buildings and portable storage containers. Managing these changes has required, and may continue to require, significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. We have provided disclosures about this new

-
25
-

segment reporting structure, but there is no guarantee that investors or the market will understand this change to our financial reporting. There is also no guarantee that this change will have the desired effect. Failure of investors or analysts to understand our revised segment reporting structure may negatively affect their ability to understand our business and operating results which could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting segment level and consider the difference between the fair value of a reporting segment and its’ carrying value, when determining whether any impairment exists. There can be no assurance that the change to our segment reporting structure will not result in impairment charges in future periods.
