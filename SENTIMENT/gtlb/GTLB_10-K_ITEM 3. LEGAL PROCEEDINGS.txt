ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
GitLab Securities Class Action and Shareholder Derivative Cases
On September 4, 2024, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Dolly v. GitLab et al., Case No. 5:24-cv-06244-EKL, naming GitLab and certain of our officers. The complaint purports to assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), SEC Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, on behalf of persons and entities who acquired our common stock between June 5, 2023 and June 3, 2024 (the “Class Period”). Plaintiff alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants made material misrepresentations or omissions regarding our use of AI features and ability to monetize our AI capabilities that artificially inflated our stock price. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, damages in an unspecified amount, as well as fees and costs. Plaintiff amended his complaint on February 5, 2025 and March 7, 2025, and we will move to dismiss the second amended complaint in April 2025.
Two putative shareholder derivative cases have been filed containing allegations based on or similar to those in the securities class action. The cases were filed on February 14, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Preciado v. Sijbrandij et al., Case No. 3:25-cv-01597 
“Preciado”
); and on February 19, 2025 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Jones v. Sijbrandij et al., Case No. 3:25-cv-01735 (
“Jones”
). Both cases are allegedly brought on our behalf. Each of the lawsuits name us as a nominal defendant, and also certain of our officers and current and former members of our board of directors. The Jones complaint purports to assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act as well as breach of fiduciary duty, while the Preciado complaint purports to assert those claims as well as unjust enrichment and related corporate torts. The complaints seek to recover unspecified damages and other relief on our behalf. 
Based on the preliminary nature of the proceedings in these actions, the outcomes remain uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.
In addition to the shareholder matters described above, we are, and from time to time may become, involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and team members. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Overview
In today’s world, software defines the speed of innovation. Every industry, business, and function within a company is dependent on software. To remain competitive and survive, nearly all companies must digitally transform and become experts at developing, delivering, and securing software.
To meet these market needs, GitLab created the DevSecOps platform, a fundamentally new approach to software development and delivery. Built with a unified data model, our platform brings together all stakeholders in the software delivery lifecycle – from development teams to operations teams to security teams. With GitLab, all stakeholders can build better, more secure software, faster.
GitLab is the solution for significant business transformation needs. Across every industry – and across companies of every size – technology leaders want to make developers more productive so they can deliver better products faster; they want to measure productivity so they can increase operational efficiency; they want to secure the software supply chain so they can reduce security and compliance risk; and, they want to accelerate secure cloud migration, so they can unlock digital transformation results. These technology leaders need a platform that enables a value stream-driven mindset that shortens the time from idea to customer value and establishes a powerful flywheel for data collection and aggregation. They are looking for a platform approach that unifies the entire development experience, so that customers can outpace and out-innovate their competition.     
We believe GitLab offers the shortest path to unlock technology transformation and business      value. GitLab accelerates our customers’ ability to innovate by accelerating their software development     from weeks to minutes. It removes the need for point tools and delivers enhanced operational efficiency by eliminating manual work, increasing productivity, and creating a culture of innovation and velocity. Embedding security earlier in the development process, GitLab enables customers to improve software security, quality, and overall compliance.
GitLab is available to any team, regardless of the size, scope, and complexity of their deployment. As a result, we have more than 50 million registered users, and more than 50% of the Fortune 100 companies are GitLab customers. For purposes of determining the number of our active customers, we look at our customers with more than $5,000 of Annual Recurring Revenue, or ARR, in a given period, who we refer to as our Base Customers. For purposes of determining our Base Customers, a single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions that use The DevSecOps platform is considered a single customer for determining each organization’s ARR.

Table of Contents
GitLab is the only DevSecOps platform built on an open-core business model. We enable any customer and contributor to add functionality to our platform. 
In calendar year 2024, nearly 900 people contributed more than 3,000 merge requests back to the core product, extending GitLab’s in-house R&D efforts and empowering our most passionate users to make improvements to the DevSecOps solution they use every day. Our open-core approach engenders trust with our customers and enables us to maintain our high velocity of innovation.
Our transparent business value also helps us grow the open source community. We make our strategy, direction, and product roadmap available to the wider community in order to encourage and solicit their feedback. Through responsible transparency, we create a deeper level of trust with our customers and make it easier to solicit contributions and collaboration from our users and customers.
GitLab offers a flexible deployment model for our customers. 
For our self-managed offering, the customer installs GitLab in their own on-premise or hybrid cloud environment. For our SaaS offering, the platform is managed by GitLab and hosted either in our public cloud or in our private cloud based on the customer’s preference. We also offer GitLab Dedicated, our single tenant SaaS solution, ideally suited for organizations with complex security and compliance requirements. See the section entitled “
Key Business Metrics—Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate and ARR” below for additional information about how we define ARR.
Key Business Metrics
We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.
Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate and ARR
We believe that our ability to retain and expand our revenue generated from our existing customers is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and our potential future business opportunities. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate measures the percentage change in our ARR derived from our customer base at a point in time. Our calculation of ARR and by extension Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate, includes both self-managed and SaaS subscription revenue. We report Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate on a threshold basis of
 130% each quarter or the actual number if below 130%.
We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating, for all customers during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts of subscriptions, including our self-managed and SaaS offerings but excluding professional services. We calculate Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with our customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end, or the Current Period ARR. The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, price adjustments, user growth within a customer, contraction, and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate.

Customers with ARR of $100,000 or More
We believe that our ability to increase the number of $100,000 ARR customers is an indicator of our market penetration and strategic demand for The DevSecOps platform. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions that use The DevSecOps platform is considered a single customer for determining each organization’s ARR. We do not count our reseller or distributor channel

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Subscription - self-managed and SaaS
Subscription - self-managed
Our self-managed subscriptions include support, maintenance, upgrades, and updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Revenue for self-managed subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the stand-ready nature of subscription elements.
The typical term of a subscription contract for self-managed offerings is one to three years.
SaaS
Our SaaS subscriptions provide access to our latest managed version of our product hosted in a public or private cloud based on the customer’s preference. Revenue from our SaaS offerings is recognized ratably over the contract period when the performance obligation is satisfied.
The typical term of a subscription contract for SaaS offerings is one to three years.
License - self-managed and other
The license component of our self-managed subscriptions reflects the revenue recognized by providing customers with access to proprietary software features. License revenue is recognized up-front when the software license is made available to our customers.
Other revenue consists of professional services revenue which is derived from fixed fee and time and materials engagements. Revenue from professional services is recognized as the services are performed and control is transferred. For fixed fee engagements that include acceptance clauses, control is deemed to transfer upon customer confirmation, as defined in the respective contract. Accordingly, revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of all contractual requirements.
Cost of Revenue
Subscription - self-managed and SaaS
Cost of revenue for self-managed and SaaS subscriptions consists primarily of allocated cloud-hosting costs paid to third-party service providers, personnel-related costs associated with our customer support personnel, including contractors, third-party payment processing fees, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We expect our cost of revenue for self-managed and SaaS subscriptions to increase in absolute dollars as our self-managed and SaaS subscription revenue increases. As our SaaS offering makes up an increasing percentage of our total revenue, we expect to see increased associated cloud-related costs, such as hosting and managing costs, which may adversely impact our gross margins.
67
Table of Contents
License - self-managed and other
Cost of self-managed license and other revenue consists primarily of contractor and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, associated with the professional services team and customer support team, third-party payment processing fees, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost of revenue for self-managed license and other to increase in absolute dollars as our self-managed and other revenue increases.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. Operating expenses also include IT overhead costs.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our sales and marketing personnel, advertising, travel and entertainment related expenses, branding and marketing events, promotions, software subscriptions, and our allocated cloud infrastructure expenses for our free tier. Sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions paid to our sales force. Such costs incurred on acquisition of an initial contract are capitalized and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of three years, and any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of 
the renewal. However, prorated costs for commissions that are incremental to obtain a self-managed license contract are expensed immediately.
We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make strategic investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base, but to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including contractors, as well as cloud infrastructure expenses to support our internal development efforts, and software and subscription services. Costs related to research and development are expensed as incurred.
We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase investments in our existing products and services. However, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executives, finance, legal, and human resources teams. General and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, and director and officer insurance, 
as well as other consulting and professional services fees, software and subscription services, in-person company-wide event expenses, and any contract termination fees.
We incur expenses
 as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and expenses for insurance, investor relations, and related professional services. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a 
68
Table of Contents
percentage of our total revenue over time, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Interest Income, and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term inve
stments.
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Loss from Equity Method Investment, Net of Tax
Loss from equity method investment, net of tax, consists of our share of losses from the results of operations of 
Arch
, following its deconsolidation.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in the foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions because we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Revenue increased
 $179.3 million, or 31%, to $759.2 million for fiscal year 2025 from $579.9 million for fiscal year 2024. 
The increase 
was primarily due to the ongoing demand for The DevSecOps platform, including adding new customers, the expansion within our existing paid customers, and an increase in our number of customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, our expansion

is reflected by our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate being 
123% and 130%, respectively. We had 1,229 customers with ARR over $100,000 as of January 31, 2025, increasin
g from 955 customers with ARR over $100,000 as of January 31, 2024.
Revenue attributed to our variable interest entity, JiHu, was

, primarily driven by an increase in expense of $14.3 million related to our in-person company-wide event, $11.0 million in personnel-related expenses, mainly attributable to an increase in our average general and administrative headcount and an increase of 
$9.6 million
 in stock-based compensation expenses (as discussed in the section titled 
“Stock-Based Compensation Expense”
 below). Other factors contributing to the increase included $3.9 million from an accrual for indirect taxes on certain international sales, $3.8 million from a loss attributable to the fair value remeasurement of acquisition related contingent consideration, $2.4 million in consulting expenses, $1.7M in acquisition related expenses and $1.1 million in charitable donation of common stock.
General and administrative expenses attributed to our variable interest entity, 
JiHu, were $4.5 million and $1.9 million 
for fiscal year 2025
 and 2024, respectively. See “Note 11. Joint Venture and Equity Method Investment” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.

For fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, interest income increased primarily due to income earned from our cash equivalents and short-term investments as a result of higher interest rates during fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024.
The 
increase in other income (expense), net is mainly due the increase in interest income, an increase in foreign exchange gains and impairment loss of equity method investment in fiscal year 2024. The increase in foreign exchange gains is primarily related to the revaluation of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and realized foreign exchange gain upon the payment of the BAPA tax assessment in fiscal year 2025.

Our effective tax rate increased by approximately 254.5% for fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. A tax benefit is expressed as a positive rate because of our pretax loss. The increase in tax benefit was primarily due to the tax effects of the BAPA negotiations between the United States and Dutch tax authorities, as well as the execution of an agreement between GitLab B.V. and the Dutch tax authority to reduce the rate of tax imposed on the tax gain recognized upon the transfer of the economic rights of the Company’s intellectual property from the Netherlands to the United States.
Our effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2025 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the tax effects of the BAPA negotiations between the United States and Dutch tax authorities, and the Company’s foreign and domestic operations.
     We executed the BAPA agreements with the U.S. and Dutch tax authorities on October 10, 2024, and October 22, 2024, respectively. On October 28, 2024, we paid the tax assessment issued by the Dutch Tax Authority, or the DTA, which reflected the BAPA negotiations and the agreement to reduce the rate of tax on the gain from the transfer of economic IP rights. As a result of the BAPA and Dutch assessment, the 2015 through 2017 tax years are closed for GitLab B.V. Pursuant to the terms in the BAPA, the Company will file amended returns for the 2018 through 2023 fiscal years; the tax returns for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were not yet due as of the end of the current fiscal year. All U.S. federal and state tax net operating losses (“NOLs”) and credits, as well as Netherlands NOLs, are not yet recognized due to the determination that they are not more likely than not to be realized.
Under the provisions of 
ASC
 740, 
Income Taxes
, the determination of our ability to recognize our deferred tax assets requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when determining our ability to recognize deferred tax assets. Consistent with prior years, we maintain that it is not more likely than not that we can recognize deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. The evidence we evaluated included operating results during the most recent three-year period and future projections. More weight is given to historical results than to expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Certain entities’ net losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation

allowance against its net deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and could be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of deferred tax assets.
As of 
January 31, 2025
, our U.S. federal 2018 through 2024 tax years were open and subject to potential examination in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, in the United States, any net operating losses or credits that were generated in prior years but not yet fully utilized in a year that is closed under the statute of limitations may also be subject to examination. Our Netherlands tax years are currently open for the tax years from 2018 to 2024, subject to adjustments as a result of the recently negotiated BAPA. We believe that we have adequately reserved for the outcome of the BAPA. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
As of January 31, 2025, unrecognized tax benefits were $25.6 million, of which $9.5 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. As of 
January 31, 2024
, the unrecognized tax benefits were $402.7 million, of which $213.7 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. We have settled and paid the BAPA tax liability with the DTA, thereby reducing the current tax liability previously classified as an unrecognized tax benefit to an immaterial amount. For unrecognized tax benefits unrelated to the BAPA, we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the remaining long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease.
It is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. For the 
years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, t
he Company recognized interest and penalties of $5.3 million, $56.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from issuances of equity securities, preferred stock and payments received from our customers. 
As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments aggregating t
o
 $992.4 million and $1.0 billion
, respectively, which were held for working capital and strategic investment purposes. As of January 31, 2025
, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks, money markets funds, 
treasuries
, and commercial paper, while short-term investments mainly consist of treasuries, corporate debt securities, 
agency securities, 
and commercial paper.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the price at which we are able to procure third-party cloud infrastructure, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of The DevSecOps platform. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Operating Activities
Our largest source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, and overhead expenses. We have generated positive cash flows in fiscal year 2024 and negative cash flows in fiscal years 2025 and 2023 from operating activities. We      have supplemented working capital through net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities.
Cash used in operating activities during the 
year ended January 31, 2025
 was $64.0 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $9.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $236.8 million (mainly attributable to stock-based compensation expense of $185.9 million and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, net of $49.7 million), and net cash outflows of $291.7 million used in changes of our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were the increase of accounts receivable of $99.6 million, the increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $58.1 million, the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $253.4 million (mainly attributable to $187.7 million for the BAPA payment), and the decrease in other non-current liabilities of $7.8 million, partially offset by the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.4 million, the increase in accrued compensation and related expenses of $4.7 million, and the increase in deferred revenue of $108.7 million. These changes primarily reflect our strong sales growth driving higher accounts receivable, and increased deferred contract acquisition costs, the aforementioned BAPA payment impact driving lower accrued expenses and other liabilities, and continued expansion of our customer subscription base leading to increased deferred revenue.
Cash provided by operating activities during the 
year ended January 31, 2024 
was $35.0 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $429.5 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $222.2 million (mainly attributable to stock-based compensation expense of $163.0 million and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, net of $43.5 million), and net cash inflows of $242.3 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $259.4 million, the increase in deferred revenue of $79.3 million and the increase in accrued compensation and related expenses of $15.2 million, partially offset by the increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $53.1 million, the increase in accounts receivable of $36.3 million, and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $23.7 million.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities during the 
year ended January 31, 2025
 was $30.5 million, primarily consisting of a $20.2 million payment for a business combination, net of cash acquired, a $7.7 million payment for an asset acquisition, and $3.8 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.7 million in proceeds from maturities, net of purchases of short-term investments.
77
Table of Contents
Cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2024 was $86.2 million, primarily consisting of $81.7 million in purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds from maturities, $2.5 million outflow as a result of an escrow payment related to a prior business combination, $1.6 million in purchases of property and equipment, and $0.5 million of other investing activities.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities during the 
year ended January 31, 2025
 was $32.6 million, attributable to $24.0 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock options exercises, and $13.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ESPP, partially offset by $4.9 million for the settlement of acquisition related contingent cash consideration.
Cash provided by financing activities during the 
year ended January 31, 2024
 was $45.2 million, attributable to $32.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock options exercises, and $12.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ESPP.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment, plus any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA, plus any non-recurring payments related to the formation of JiHu. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments in property and equipment, any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA, and any non-recurring payments related to the formation of JiHu, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, and strengthening our financial position. One limitation of adjusted free cash flow is that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period.
The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in thousands):

Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We believe our judgments and estimates associated with the determination of standalone selling price for each performance obligation in revenue recognition, which we discuss further below, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
See “Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price or SSP for each performance obligation. We use judgment in determining SSP for our products and services. To determine SSP, we maximize the use of observable standalone sales and observable data, where available. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, we utilize available information that may include other observable inputs or use the expected cost-plus margin approach to estimate the price we would charge if the products and services were sold separately.
Self-managed subscriptions include both (i) a right to use the underlying software and (ii) a right to receive post-contract customer support during the subscription term. Post-contract customer support comprises maintenance services (including updates and upgrades to the software on a when and if available basis) and support services. We have concluded that the right to use the software, which is recognized upon delivery of the license, and the right to receive technical support and software fixes and updates, which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, are two distinct performance obligations. Since neither of these performance obligations are sold on a standalone basis, we estimate the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation using a model based on the “expected cost plus margin” approach and update the model on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances change. This model uses observable data points to develop the main inputs and assumptions which include the estimated historical costs to develop the paid features in the software license and the estimated future costs to provide post-contract customer support. Based on this model, we determined the SSP allocation for each of our paid tiers across various subscription tenures.
Compensation Recovery Analysis
As disclosed in “Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, this Form 10-K reflects our identification and correction of certain errors in our prior year financial statements. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, consisting entirely of independent directors, conducted a recovery analysis of incentive-based compensation received by our executive officers during the relevant period, as contemplated by Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and in accordance with our Executive Officer Clawback Policy. Based on this analysis, no recovery of incentive-based compensation is required, as the financial statement adjustments did not impact the metrics used to determine incentive compensation during the relevant recovery period, and thus there was no erroneously awarded compensation.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
We have operations both within the United States and internationally. We 
are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in 
interest
 rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
As of 
January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, we h
ad $992.4 million and $1.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, our cash equivalents and short-term investments of $898.3 million and $955.3 million, respectively, mainly consist of money market funds, treasuries, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working capital and strategic investment purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates, which could affect our results of operations. Based on our investment portfolio balance as of January 31, 2025, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 1% (100 basis points) would result in a decrease or an increase in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $4.7 million. Such losses would only be realized if we sell the investments prior to maturity. The weighted-average life of our investment portfolio was approximately 6 months as of January 31, 2025.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
To date, all of our sales contracts have been denominated in U.S. dollars, except for our variable interest entity, JiHu, which sells in local currency in its designated area. Our revenue is not subject to a material foreign currency risk. Operating expenses within the United States are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, while operating expenses incurred outside the United States are primarily denominated in each country’s respective local currency. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is each country’s respective local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many 
factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. In the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, or expenses increase, our operating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in
 the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. Moreover, as of January 31, 2025, we have $59.9 million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of these
 cash balances may materially c
hange along with the weakness or strength of the U.S. dollar. As of January 31, 2025, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future.

GitLab Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GitLab Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Evaluation of standalone selling prices (SSPs) for self-managed subscription and self-managed license performance obligations
83
Table of Contents
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized self-managed subscription revenue and self-managed license revenue of $458.9 million and $68.4 million, respectively, for the year ended January 31, 2025. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP. To determine SSP the Company maximizes the use of observable standalone sales and observable data where available. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, the Company utilizes available information that may include market conditions, pricing strategies, the economic life of the software, and other observable inputs and uses the expected cost plus margin approach to estimate the price the Company would charge if the products and services were sold separately.
We identified the evaluation of SSPs for self-managed subscription and self-managed license performance obligations as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the key assumption used to determine SSP, which required challenging auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging and subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the estimated costs to develop the paid features in the expected cost plus margin approach. Additionally, the estimate of SSP was sensitive to variation in this key assumption.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. 
•
We tested certain controls over the Company’s revenue process, including controls over the development of SSPs and the relevance and reliability of the underlying data. 
•
We evaluated the overall methodology used to determine the estimate of SSPs based on the expected cost plus margin approach.
•
We performed sensitivity analyses over the Company’s assumptions used to determine the SSPs to identify the costs to develop the paid features as the key assumption and to assess the impact of changes in the assumption on the Company’s SSPs.
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the key assumption by comparing it to historical data, internal data, and relevant peer data, where available. 
•
We evaluated the data utilized by management to estimate the cost to develop the paid features by examining a selection of requests to merge code and interviewing the Company’s engineering team.
•
We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of estimated selling prices.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited GitLab Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Fiscal Year
The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal year 2025 and 2024 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allocation of revenue to the license element in the Company's self-managed subscriptions, estimating the amortization period for capitalized costs to obtain a contract, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of contingent consideration, taxation of intangible property in company formation, merger, or acquisition transactions, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits, valuation of acquired intangibles assets and impairment of goodwill. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the accounts of wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries as well as a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The ownership interest of other investors is recorded as noncontrolling interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company determines the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary and the variable interest entity in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary and the variable interest entity operate. Items included in the financial statements of such subsidiaries and the variable interest entity are measured using that functional currency.
Gains and losses that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended January 31, 2025
, 
2024
 and 
2023
, the Company recognized foreign exchange gains (losses), net of $
9.4
 million, $(
2.9
) million and $
5.1
 million, respectively. 
For subsidiaries and the variable interest entity where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, the Company uses the period-end exchange rates to translate assets and liabilities, the average monthly exchange rates to translate revenue and expenses, and historical exchange rates to translate stockholders’ equity into U.S. dollars. The Company records translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
 For the 
years ended January 31, 2025
, 
2024
 and 
2023
, the Company recognized foreign translation adjustments of $(
11.9
) million, $(
3.9
) million and $(
6.1
) million, respectively.

Table of Contents
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash
 and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, consists of cash held in checking and savings accounts, investments in money market accounts and certain highly-liquid investments. The Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted cash as of January 31, 2023, consists of a $
2.5
 million acquisition related security deposit withheld in an escrow for any potential post-closing indemnification claims. The Company fully paid this acquisition-related holdback during the year ended January 31, 2024. Refer to “Note 6. Acquisitions.” 
Short-Term Investments - Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its marketable securities with stated maturities of three months and greater at the date of purchase as short-term investments due to its ability to use these securities to support the Company’s current operations.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, a
ll short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or based on quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. If the fair value of a security falls below its amortized cost, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value if management intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If neither of these conditions are satisfied, impairment is assessed for credit losses by comparing the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis, and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the excess of amortized cost over expected cash flows. Impairment losses not attributable to credit losses are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax. 
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized upon sale and are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale is included within interest income on our consolidated statements of operations.
Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period and are adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income of the consolidated statements of operations.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable, which represent trade receivables from the Company’s customers, are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends credit of typically 30 to 60 days to its customers in the normal course of business and does not require collateral from its customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable.
As of 
January 31, 2025 and 2024
, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $
1.0
 million and $
0.7
 million, respectively. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance when identified.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. At times, cash deposits may be in excess of insured limits. The Company believes that the financial institutions or corporations that hold its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these 
96
Table of Contents
balances. 
The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses on accounts receivable when deemed necessary.
The Company uses various distribution channels.
 As
 of January 31, 2025, 
two of these channel partners represented 
11
% and 
12
% of the accounts receivable balance, respecti
vely, while as of January 31, 2024, two of these channel partners represented 
12
% and 
13
% of the accounts receivable balance. There were no individual customers whose balance represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and 2024.
There were no individual customers whose revenue represented more than 10% of total revenue during the 
years ended January 31, 2025
, 
2024
 and 
2023
.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which to transact and the market-based risk. We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature. The Company also recorded acquisition related contingent considerations at fair value, as further discussed in “Note 4. Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.” 
The Company measures assets and liabilities at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires it to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U.S. GAAP describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure the fair value:
Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial or nonfinancial asset or liability.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue primarily from offering self-managed (on-premise) and SaaS subscriptions. Revenue is also generated from professional services, including consulting and training.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the promised products and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products and services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, the Company applies the following five-step model as a framework:
1)
Identify the contract with a customer.
 We consider the terms and conditions of our arrangements with customers to identify contracts under ASC 606. We consider that we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, we can identify each party's rights regarding the products and services to be transferred, we can identify the payment terms for the products and 
97
Table of Contents
services, we have determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based upon factors including the customer's historical payment experience or, for new customers, credit and financial information pertaining to the customers. At contract inception, we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and 
accounted for as a single contract. Further, contract modifications generally qualify as a separate contract.
The typical term of a subscription contract for a self-managed or SaaS offering is 
one
 to 
three years
. Our contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term and we act as principal in all our customer contracts. Customers have the right to terminate their contracts generally only if we breach the contrac
t and we fail to remedy the breach in accordance with the contractual terms.
2)
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
. Performance obligations in our contracts are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
Our self-managed subscriptions include 
two
 performance obligations: (i) to provide access to proprietary features in our software, and (ii) to provide support and maintenance (including the combined obligation to provide software updates on a when-and-if-available basis).
Our SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which is evaluated to be a single performance obligation.
Services-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are distinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.
Some of our customers have the option to purchase additional licenses or renew at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not provide a material right as they are either at the same price as the existing licenses or are within our range of standalone selling price (“SSP”) and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation. Where material rights are identified in our contracts, they are treated as separate performance obligations.
3)
Determine the transaction price
. We determine transaction price based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring products and services to the customer.
Our contracts are non-refundable and non-cancellable. We do not offer refunds, rebates, or credits to our customers in the normal course of business.
For contracts with a one year term, we applied a practical expedient available under ASC 606 and therefore do not make an evaluation for the existence of a significant financing component. In these contracts, at contract inception, the period between when we expect to transfer a promised product or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that product or service will be one year or less. For contracts with terms of more than a year, we have applied judgment in determining that advance payments in such contracts are not collected with the primary intention of availing finance and therefore, do not represent a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales tax and other indirect taxes). We do not offer the right of refund in our contracts.
4)
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP 
98
Table of Contents
for each performance obligation. We use judgment in determining the SSP for our products and services. We typically assess the SSP for our products and services on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances change. To determine SSP, we maximize the use of observable standalone sales and observable data, where available. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, we utilize available information that may include other observable inputs or use the expected cost-plus margin approach to estimate the price we would charge if the products and services were sold separately. The expected cost-plus margin approach is currently used to determine SSP for each distinct performance obligation for self-managed subscriptions.
We have concluded that (i) the right to use the software and (ii) the right to receive technical support and software fixes and updates are 
two
 distinct performance obligations in our self-managed subscriptions. Since neither of these performance obligations are sold on a standalone basis, we estimate SSP for each performance obligation using a model based on the “expected cost-plus margin” approach and update the model on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances change. This model uses observable data points to develop the main inputs and assumptions, which include the estimated historical costs to develop the paid features in the software license and the estimated future costs to provide post-contract customer support.
5)
Revenue is recognized when or as we satisfy a performance obligation
. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised products and services to a customer. We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the products and services to our customers for an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and services. All revenue is generated from contracts with customers.
Subscription - self-managed and SaaS
Subscription - self-managed
The Company's self-managed subscriptions include support, maintenance, upgrades, and updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Revenue for 
self-managed subscriptions
 is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the stand-ready nature of subscription elements.
The Company offers two tiers of paid subscriptions as part of the self-managed model: Premium and Ultimate.
The typical term of a subscription contract for self-managed offerings is 
one
 to 
three years
.
SaaS
We also offer two tiers of paid SaaS subscriptions: Premium and Ultimate. These subscriptions provide access to our latest managed version of our product hosted in a public or private cloud based on the customer’s preference. Revenue from our SaaS products (Subscription revenue - SaaS) is recognized ratably over the contract period when the performance obligation is satisfied.
The typical term of a subscription contract for SaaS offering is 
one
 to 
three years
.
License - self-managed and other
The license component of our self-managed subscriptions reflects the revenue recognized by providing customers with rights to use proprietary software features. 
Other revenue consists of professional services revenue which is derived from fixed fee and time and materials offerings, subject to customer acceptance for certain fixed fee offerings. Uncertainty exists about customer acceptance and therefore, control is presumed to transfer upon confirmation from the customer, as defined in each professional services contract. Accordingly, revenue is recognized upon 
99
Table of Contents
satisfaction of all requirements per the applicable contract. Revenue from professional services provided on a time and material basis is recognized over the period services are delivered.
The Company presents financial information about disaggregation of revenue in “Note 3. Revenues” of the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred Revenue and Contract Assets
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Such amounts are recognized as revenue over the contractual period. The portion of deferred revenue that the Company will recognize during the twelve-month period from the balance sheet date is recorded within current liabilities and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term.
The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Customers are generally billed in advance, including some multi-year contracts, but the majority of customers in multi-year contracts specifically request to pay annually in advance. Where the value of revenue recognized exceeds the value of amounts invoiced for a contract at the end of a reporting period, the excess is reclassified from deferred revenue to contract assets until invoiced. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  
During the 
years ended January 31, 2025
, 
2024
 and 
2023
, $
331.8
 million, $
217.0
 million and $
145.9
 million, respectively, of revenue was recognized, which was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the reporting periods presented.
Remaining Performance Obligations
As of January 31, 2025, the aggregate transaction price allocated to billed and unbilled remaining performance obligations for which revenue has not yet been recognized was appr
oximately $
945.0
 million. Of this amount, the Company  expects to recognize approximately 
61
% over the next 12 months and 
87
% over the next 24 months.
Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs
Sales commissions and bonuses that are recoverable and incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers are capitalized.
Commissions and bonuses paid upon the acquisition of an initial contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit which has been determined generally to be 
3
 years based on historical analysis of average customer life and useful life of our product offerings. Commissions paid for subsequent renewals are amortized over the renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis and included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. However, costs for commissions that are incremental to obtain a self-managed license contract are expensed immediately. The Company periodically reviews these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs. The Company did not recognize any impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs during the periods presented.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue for self-managed and SaaS subscriptions consists primarily of allocated cloud-hosting costs paid to third party service providers, personnel-related costs associated with our customer 
100
Table of Contents
support personnel, including contractors, third-party payment processing fees, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. 
Cost
 of self-managed license and other revenue consists primarily of contractor and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses, associated with the professional services team and customer support team, and allocated overhead.

Research and Development
Costs related to research and development of the Company’s software offerings are expensed as incurred. These costs consist primarily of compensation paid to the Company's research and development personnel, including contractors.
The Company’s internal customer software development process follows an iterative process that results in more frequent software releases than do traditional sequential or waterfall development methodologies and also results in internal validation of the software releases very shortly before they are made available to customers. Therefore, to date, costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility through internal validation of the software releases. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. To date, software development for internal use has been immaterial and no such costs have been capitalized.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included within sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Th
ese include costs incurred on public relations, website design, advertising, field marketing, and market research services.
 The Company incurred advertising costs of $
34.5
 million, $
32.5
 million and $
27.3
 million during the 
years ended January 31, 2025
, 
2024
 and 
2023
, respectively.
Loss Contingencies
If an exposure to any potential claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. If applicable, the Company records receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. Due to uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability and may revise its estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Management applies significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that 
101
Table of Contents
were more likely than not to be realized in the future. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. 
Compliance with income tax regulations requires the Company to take certain tax positions.  In assessing the exposure associated with various filing positions, the Company determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company uses a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are included within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
Comprehensive Loss and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive loss includes net loss and changes in stockholders’ equity that are excluded from net loss due to changes in the Company’s cumulative foreign currency translation account and unrealized gains or losses on short-term investments.
Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net loss per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic loss per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive instruments. We exclude equity instruments from the calculation of diluted loss per share if the effect of including such instruments is anti-dilutive. Since we are in a net loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has granted equity classified stock-based awards to team members, members of its board of directors, and non-employee advisors. The majority of the Company's stock-based awards have been granted to team members and the service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over 
four years
.
The cost of stock-based awards granted to team members is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is generally recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options.
In May 2021, the Company granted 
3
 million shares of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) tied to our Class B common stock to Mr. Sijbrandij, our Co-founder and former CEO. The RSUs contain a service condition and a performance condition based on the achievement of 
eight
 separate stock price hurdles/tranches ranging from $
95
 to $
500
 per share. The fair value of the RSUs was determined utilizing a 
102
Table of Contents
Monte Carlo valuation model. We recognize total stock-based compensation expense over the derived service period of each tranche using the accelerated attribution method, regardless of whether the stock price hurdles are achieved. The RSUs were forfeited during the year ended January 31, 2025. Refer to “Note 9. Equity” for further discussion. 
In September 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to enable eligible team members to purchase shares of our Class A common stock with accumulated payroll deductions. We recognize stock-based expenses related to the shares to be issued under the ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We have been determining the volatility input based on the historical volatility of our peer group until such time as we established a 2-year public trading history of our own stock price. For the new offering period starting December 2023, we transitioned to using an average blend of historical volatility of our peer group and volatility of our own stock price when determining the volatility input. 
Since fiscal year 2023, JiHu has maintained an employee stock option plan ("JiHu 2022 ESOP") for its employees. In June 2024, the board of directors of JiHu approved a new employee stock option plan ("JiHu 2024 ESOP") for its employees in order to grant additional shares. The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and stock option awards is measured on the date of grant and compensation costs related to these awards are recognized on a graded attribution method as the grants include a performance condition for both the JiHu 2022 ESOP and JiHu 2024 ESOP ("JiHu ESOPs"). The Company considers the RSAs and stock option awards granted pursuant to the JiHu ESOP as potentially dilutive equity instruments that will result in dilution of the Company’s stake in JiHu upon vesting of such awards (or, in the case of option awards granted pursuant to the JiHu ESOP, upon vesting and subsequent exercise into shares of JiHu common stock). Any such dilution will be accounted for as an equity transaction. Until such awards granted pursuant to the JiHu ESOP are vested (or, in the case of option awards, vested and ultimately exercised into shares of JiHu common stock), the Company will continue to record the recognized stock-compensation expense of JiHu as part of the noncontrolling interest.
In June 2022, the Company granted 
0.4
 million performance stock units (“2022 PSUs”) to senior members of its management team and in December 2024, the Company granted 
0.3
 million performance stock units (“2024 PSUs”) to its new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The 2022 and 2024 PSUs are subject to the achievement of specified performance targets and continuous service through the applicable vesting dates. The fair value of 2022 and 2024 PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the date of grant and compensation costs related to awards expected to vest are recognized on a graded-vesting method over the requisite service periods. The estimate of awards expected to vest is reassessed by management at each reporting period.

Table of Contents
Business Combination
We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire beginning from the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
We amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over a period of 
three years
.
The liabilities for any contingent consideration are established at the time of the acquisition and will be evaluated at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value adjustment is recorded in general and administrative expenses.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated us
eful life of 
five years
, a
nd computers over 
two years
.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, based on whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. At the lease commencement date, the Company determines the lease classification between finance and operating and recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for each lease component. A right-of-use asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make payments during the lease term. The Company has operating leases for office premises leased by JiHu, as well as for an immaterial short-term sales office in India. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components separately. The Company does not recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases (i.e., leases with a term of 12 months or less).
The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The discount rate used to determine the present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date for borrowings with a similar term. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments
 adjusted for prepaid lease payments to lessors
.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset (including an intangible asset) may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If a long-lived asset (including an intangible asset) is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets (including intangible assets) in any of the years presented. 
104
Table of Contents
We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors, including our market capitalization, we determined there to be no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.
Equity Method Investment
The Company applies the equity method of accounting to investments when it has significant influence, but not controlling interest in the investee. The Company’s equity method investments are reported at cost and adjusted each period for its proportionate share of the investee’s income or loss. The cost on initial recognition of retained interest in a former subsidiary is based on fair value on the date of loss of control. The Company’s proportionate share of the net loss resulting from the investment is reported under loss from equity method investment, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Refer to “Note 11. Joint Venture and Equity Method Investment” for more information.
Revision of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
During the quarter ended January 31, 2025, the Company identified errors related to the understatement of certain tax liabilities associated with the formation of our joint venture, JiHu in February 2021. The Company concluded that the impact of the errors on previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the annual periods ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 were immaterial. However, the Company has revised the prior-period consolidated financial statements to correct these errors.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 1 financial instruments, such as money market funds which are traded in active markets, is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments such as commercial paper, corporate debt and U.S. government securities are obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable in the market, including readily available pricing sources for the identical underlying security that may not be actively traded. The Company’s marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. 
The Company uses the specific-identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of the Company’s short-term investments classified as available-for-sale. For the periods presented, the Company did not have any material realized gains or losses as a result of maturities or sales of short-term investments.

6. Acquisitions
Opstrace
On December 3, 2021, th
e Company completed the acquisition of Opstrace, Inc., a technology company based in San Francisco, California.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $
13.5
 million, which included contingent cash consideration.
As of January 31, 2023, t
he Company held $
2.5
 million in an escrow as partial security for post-closing indemnification claims made within 
18
 months of the closing da
te. The Company fully paid out this acquisition-related holdback during the 
year ended January 31, 2024.
Rezilion
On May 23, 2024 (the “Asset Acquisition Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets, primarily software intellectual property, of Rezilion Inc. and its subsidiary, Rezilion Ltd. (collectively, “Rezilion”) for approximately $
7.3
 million in cash.
The Rezilion transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired were concentrated in the developed intellectual property. Acquisition-related direct transaction costs were capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired.
114
Table of Contents
On the Asset Acquisition Date, the fair value of the developed technology was $
7.7
 million including $
0.4
 million of acquisition-related direct costs. The developed technology acquired has an estimated useful life of 
three
 years
.
Oxeye
On March 20, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of Oxeye Security Limited (“Oxeye”), a cloud-native application security and risk management solution company based in Israel. The Company believes this acquisition will allow the Company to strengthen its product offerings.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following (in thousands): 
Closing cash consideration
$
16,737

Cash held in escrow

Total consideration
$
20,330

Total consideration includes $
3.6
 million deposited in an escrow account as partial security for post-closing indemnification claims made within 
15
 months of the Acquisition Date. As the Company is not the legal owner of the escrow account, it is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2025. 
As part of the acquisition, there was also a holdback in the amount of $
3.2
 million to be paid to the 
two
 co-founders (the “founder holdback”) in 
three
 equal tranches of 
33.3
%. The first such payment will be paid if certain milestones are achieved on or before the first anniversary of the closing date, provided such founder is employed by the Company upon completion of the milestones. The second and third tranches will be paid provided such founder is employed by the Company on the second and third anniversaries of the closing dates, respectively. As the founder holdback arrangement represents compensation for post-combination services, the Company has excluded the entire $
3.2
 million from the purchase price to be allocated, and will recognize the amount as expense over the period of services rendered after factoring in the likelihood of achieving the milestones in the first year. 
During the 
year ended January 31, 2025
, the milestones attached to the first payment tranche were achieved and $
1.1
 million was paid out to the 
two
 co-founders. The Company recorded $
1.1
 million of the founder holdback in general and administrative expenses in its consolidated statement of operations for the 
year ended January 31, 2025
.
Acquisition related transaction costs were $
1.2
 million for the 
year ended January 31, 2025
, and were recorded by the Company in general and administrative expenses in its consolidated statement of operations.
The Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values, with the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and the purchase consideration reflected in goodwill. The total purchase price of $
20.3
 million was allocated using information available to the Company at the time of acquisition. The Company may continue to adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation after obtaining more information regarding asset valuations, liabilities assumed, tax-related items and revisions of preliminary estimates. 
During the year ended January 31, 2025, The Company recorded an acquisition measurement period adjustment of $
0.3
 million to reflect adjustments to certain deferred tax assets resulting from the filing of income tax returns for the periods prior to acquisition date. These purchase price allocation adjustments resulted in a $
0.3
 million decrease to goodwill and a corresponding increase to the deferred tax liability

As of the Acquisition Date, developed technology of the acquired business had an estimated useful life of 
three years
. The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was estimated using the replacement cost method, which utilizes assumptions for the cost to replace it, such as time and resources required, as well as a theoretical profit margin and opportunity costs. The goodwill is primarily attributed to the synergies expected to be realized following the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for Israeli income tax purposes.
Results of operations of the business acquired have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. The revenue and net income (loss) earned by the business acquired following the acquisition are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations; and accordingly, pro forma financial statements have not been presented.

Former CEO Restricted Stock Units (“Former CEO RSU”)
In May 2021, 
the Company granted 
3
 million RSUs tied to its Class B common stock to Sytse Sijbrandij, the Company’s co-founder and former CEO, with an estimated aggregate grant date fair value of $
8.8
 million. As measured from the grant date, the derived service period of the respective tranches ranges from 
2
 to 
7
 years. In December 2024, Mr. Sijbrandij resigned from his position as CEO and as a result, all unvested RSUs were forfeited, which resulted in a $
3.4
 million net gain of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended January 31, 2025. During the years ended January 31, 2024 and 
2023
, the Company recorded $

no
 unrecognized stock-based compensation expense remaining related to these RSUs.
2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
In September 2021, the Company’s board of directors and its stockholders approved the ESPP and participation of eligible team members.
During the quarter ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s stock price on the purchase date, May 31, 2024, was lower than the Company’s stock price on the previously applicable offering date. As a result, the offering in effect was reset with the lower stock price becoming the new offering price and rolled over to a new 
24-month
 offering period. The reset was treated as a modification resulting in incremental expense totaling $
1.0
 million, which is being recognized over the remaining requisite service period as of the date of reset.
During the quarter ended July 31, 2023, the Company’s stock price on the purchase date, May 31, 2023, was lower than the Company’s stock price on the previously applicable offering date. As a result, the offering in effect was reset with the lower stock price becoming the new offering price and rolled over to a new 
24-month
 offering period. The reset was treated as a modification resulting in incremental expense totaling $
9.4
 million, which is being recognized over the remaining requisite service period as of the date of reset.
The following table summarizes assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the ESPP for the offering period in effect using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

11. Joint Venture and Equity Method Investment
Joint Venture
In February 2021, the Company along with Sequoia CBC Junyuan (Hubei) Equity Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership) and Suzhou Gaocheng Xinjian Equity Investment Fund Partnership (Limited Partnership) executed an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to establish GitLab Information Technology (Hubei) Co., LTD (“JiHu”), a legal entity in the People’s Republic of China. The Company accounted for JiHu as a variable interest entity and consolidated the entity in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. As of January 31, 2025 and 
2024
, the Company retains control over JiHu with its equity stake at
 appro
ximately 
54
% for each period presented. 
Since fiscal year 2023, JiHu has maintained an employee stock option plan (“JiHu 2022 ESOP”) for its employees. In June 2024, the board of directors of JiHu approved a new employee stock option plan (“JiHu 2024 ESOP”) for its employees in order to grant additional shares. The fair value of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and stock option awards is measured on the date of grant and compensation costs related to these awards are recognized on a graded attribution method; as the grants include a performance condition for both the JiHu 2022 ESOP and JiHu 2024 ESOP (“JiHu ESOPs”). 
As a result of forfeitures triggered by the departure of certain executives from JiHu in fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024, the Company reversed stock-based compensation previously recorded for such executives. There were no forfeitures in fiscal year 2023. For the years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $
1.8
 million stock-based compensation net expense, $
1.5
 million net gain and $
7.8
 million stock-based compensation expense, respectively.
As of January 31, 2025, approximately $

The Company executed the Bilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement (“BAPA”) agreements with the United States Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) and the Netherlands’ Dutch Tax Authority (“DTA”) on October 10, 2024, and October 22, 2024, respectively. On October 28, 2024, the Company paid $
187.7
 million to satisfy the tax assessment issued by the DTA, including accrued interest, which reflected the BAPA negotiations and the agreement to reduce the rate of tax on the gain from the transfer of economic IP rights. As a result of the BAPA and the DTA assessment, the 2015 through 2017 tax years are closed for GitLab B.V. Pursuant to the terms in the BAPA, the Company will file amended returns for the 2018 through 2023 fiscal years; the tax returns for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were filed. All U.S. federal and state tax net operating losses (“NOLs”) and credits, as well as Netherlands NOLs, are not yet recognized due to the determination that they are not more likely than not to be realized. 
As of 
January 31, 2025
, the Company’s U.S. federal 2018 through 2024 tax years were open and subject to potential examination in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, in the United States, any net operating losses or credits that were generated in prior years but not yet fully utilized in a year that is closed under the statute of limitations may also be subject to examination. The Company’s Netherlands tax years are currently open from tax years 2018 to 2024, subject to adjustments as a result of the 
126
Table of Contents
recently negotiated BAPA. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for the outcome of the BAPA. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from all existing and potential examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company continues to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
As of January 31, 2025, unrecognized tax benefits approximated $
25.6
 million, of which $
9.5
 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. As of 
January 31, 2024
, unrecognized tax benefits approximated $
402.7
 million, of which $
213.7
 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company has settled and paid the BAPA tax liability with the DTA, thereby reducing the current tax liability previously classified as an unrecognized tax benefit. For unrecognized tax benefits unrelated to the BAPA, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the remaining long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease.

Loss Contingencies
In accordance with ASC 450, 
Loss Contingencies,
 the Company accrues for contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an estimated liability related to certain labor matters regarding its use of contractors in certain foreign countries. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, the estimated liability relating to these matters was $
1.4
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively, is recorded in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Warranties and Indemnifications
The Company enters into service level agreements with customers which warrant defined levels of uptime and support response times and permit those customers to receive credits for prepaid amounts in the event that those performance and response levels are not met. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant failures to meet defined levels of performance and response. In connection with the service level agreements, the Company has not incurred any significant costs and has not accrued any liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company agrees to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach 
128
Table of Contents
of such agreements, intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties, and other liabilities relating to or arising from the Company’s platform or the Company’s acts or omissions. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments.
In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that may enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
Legal Proceedings
GitLab Securities Class Action and Shareholder Derivative Cases
On September 4, 2024, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Dolly v. GitLab et al., Case No. 5:24-cv-06244-EKL, naming GitLab and certain of our officers. The complaint purports to assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), SEC Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, on behalf of persons and entities who acquired our common stock between June 5, 2023 and June 3, 2024 (the “Class Period”). Plaintiff alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants made material misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Company’s use of AI features and ability to monetize the Company’s AI capabilities that artificially inflated the Company’s stock price. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, damages in an unspecified amount, as well as fees and costs. Plaintiff amended his complaint on February 5, 2025 and March 7, 2025, and we will move to dismiss the second amended complaint in April 2025.
Two putative shareholder derivative cases have been filed containing allegations based on or similar to those in the securities class action. The cases were filed on February 14, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Preciado v. Sijbrandij et al., Case No. 3:25-cv-01597 (
“Preciado”
); and on February 19, 2025 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Jones v. Sijbrandij et al., Case No. 3:25-cv-01735 (
“Jones”
). Both cases are allegedly brought on the Company’s behalf. Each of the lawsuits name the Company as a nominal defendant, and also certain of the Company’s officers and current and former members of the Company’s board of directors. The Jones complaint purports to assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act as well as breach of fiduciary duty, while the Preciado complaint purports to assert those claims as well as unjust enrichment and related corporate torts. The complaints seek to recover unspecified damages and other relief on the Company’s behalf.
Based on the preliminary nature of the proceedings in these actions, the outcomes remain uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.
In addition to the shareholder matters described above, the Company is, and from time to time may become, involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of management, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.
Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and team members. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless 
129
Table of Contents
of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
15. Subsequent Events 
On March 3, 2025, the Company announced that Ian Steward will join as Chief Revenue Officer, effective May 3, 2025. Ashley Kramer, who has been serving as Interim Chief Revenue Officer while maintaining her role as Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer, will continue in both positions until the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") ("certifying officers") have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of January 31, 2025
. 
Our certifying officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2025.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). The Company's management, with participation of the CEO and CFO, under the oversight of our board of directors, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 using the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP's report appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness
As disclosed in our previously issued Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During fiscal year 2024, we determined that a material weakness existed due to a lack of policies and procedures related to the operation of control activities and inadequate communication of information to control owners and operators related to the objectives and responsibilities for internal control in a manner which supports the internal control environment at the Company. In particular:

We did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (“IT”) general controls for information systems used in the financial reporting processes related to revenue. In particular, we did not design and maintain effective (i) program change management controls to ensure that IT programs, data changes and migrations affecting financial IT applications and underlying records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately and (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, restricted user and privileged access to our financial applications, data and programs to the appropriate personnel. The ineffective design and operation of IT general controls resulted in the ineffective operation of automated controls and manual controls using reports and information from the impacted information systems used in the financial reporting processes related to revenue.
We implemented remediation actions during fiscal year 2025 to address this material weakness and enhance our control environment. Our remediation actions included:
•
Strengthening IT governance and designing IT general controls related to certain revenue systems, including program change management, restricting user access to our internal systems used for financial reporting and enhancing the retention of contemporaneous documentation of reviews over IT general controls, and

•
Developing and deploying training programs regarding the operation and importance of internal controls.
We have tested and evaluated the implementation of these new and revised processes and internal controls to determine whether they are designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that they will prevent or detect a material error in our consolidated financial statements. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that this material weakness has been remediated as of January 31, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired objectives. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

The Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan was entered into during an open trading window in accordance with the Company’s policies regarding transactions in the Company’s securities and is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

93,175
 shares, which reflects the aggregate maximum number of shares underlying Ms. Farmer’s restricted stock units which may be sold, without excluding the shares that will be sold to satisfy the tax withholding obligations, so long as the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock is higher than certain minimum threshold prices specified in the Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan between April 1, 2025 and 
December 26, 2025
.
The Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan includes a representation from Ms. Farmer to the broker administering the plan that she was not in possession of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or the securities subject to the Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan at the time it was entered into. A similar representation was made to the Company in connection with the adoption of the Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan under the Company’s policies regarding transactions in the Company’s securities. Those representations were made as of the date of 
adoption
 of the Farmer Rule 10b5-1 Plan, and speak only as of such date. In making those representations, there is no assurance with respect to any material nonpublic information of which Ms. Farmer was unaware, or with respect to any material nonpublic information acquired by Ms. Farmer or the Company after the date of the representation.
Once executed, transactions under each of the Sijbrandij Rule 10b5-1 Plan, the Robins Rule 10b5-1 Plan and the Farmer 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and/or Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or report any modification, termination, or other activity under current or future Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by Mr. Sijbrandij, Mr. Robins, Ms. Farmer or other officers or directors of the Company.
