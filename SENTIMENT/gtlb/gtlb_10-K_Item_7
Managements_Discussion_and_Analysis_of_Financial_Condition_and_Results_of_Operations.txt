These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and else

It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Annual Report may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forw
ard-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. We undertake no obligation t
o update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as require
d by law. 
You should read 
this report
 and the documents that we reference in 
this report
 and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as exhibits to 
this report
 with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.
Summary Risk Factors
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those risks more fully described below in the section titled “Risk Factors.” These risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks:
•
Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately and effectively manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems, processes and controls, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.
•
Our recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. Our growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
•
We have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis. If we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.
•
Security and privacy breaches may hurt our business.
•
We face heightened risk of security breaches because we use third-party open source technologies and incorporate a substantial amount of open source code in our products.
•
We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

•
We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
•
If our services fail to perform properly, whether due to material defects with the software or external issues, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to liability claims.
•
The market for our services is relatively new and rapidly evolving with uncertain growth expectations which would adversely affect our future results and the trading price of our Class A common stock.
•
We are dependent on sales and marketing strategies to drive our growth in our revenue. These sales and marketing strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities. Any decline in our customer renewals and expansions could harm our future operating results.
•
Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.
•
As our product offerings mature and expand, our pricing and packaging for new products may result in existing customers purchasing new products on terms less favorable to us in order to replace the products they currently purchase or subscribe for from us.
•    The implementation of AI and machine learning technologies in our services may result in reputational harm, liability, increased expenditures, or other adverse consequences to our business operations.
•
Transparency is one of our core values. While we will continue to prioritize transparency, we must also promote "responsible" transparency as transparency can have unintended negative consequences.
•
The Handbook may not be up to date or accurate, which may result in negative third-party scrutiny or be used in ways that adversely affects our business.
•
Customers may choose to stay on our free self-managed or SaaS product offerings instead of converting into a paying customer.
•
Failure to effectively expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our services.
•
We rely on our management team and other key team members and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key team members or our inability to hire, integrate, train and retain qualified personnel, could harm our business.
•
Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed. 
•
We engage our team members in various ways, including direct hires, through PEOs and as independent contractors. As a result of these methods of engagement, we face certain challenges and risks that can affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
