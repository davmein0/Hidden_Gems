OVERVIEW
Mercury Systems is a technology company that delivers mission-critical processing to the edge to solve the most pressing aerospace and defense challenges. Mercury’s products and solutions are deployed in more than 300 programs and across 35 countries. The Company is headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, and has over 20 locations worldwide.
The Mercury Processing Platform is the unique advantage we provide to our customers. It comprises the innovative technologies we’ve developed and acquired for more than 40 years that bring integrated, mission-critical processing capabilities to the edge. Our processing platform spans the full breadth of signal processing—from RF front end to the human-machine interface—to rapidly convert meaningful data, gathered in the most remote and hostile environments, into critical decisions. It allows us to offer standard products and custom solutions from silicon to system scale, including components, modules, subsystems, and systems and it embodies the customer-centric approach we take to delivering capabilities that are mission-ready, trusted and secure, software-defined, and open and modular.
As a leading manufacturer of essential components, products, modules and subsystems, we sell to the top U.S. and European defense prime contractors, the U.S. government and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) commercial aerospace companies. Our mission-critical products and solutions are deployed by our customers for a variety of applications including sensor and radar processing, electronic warfare, avionics, weapons, and command, control, communications, and intelligence ("C4I"). Mercury has built a trusted, robust portfolio of proven capabilities, leveraging the most advanced commercial silicon technologies and purpose-built to exceed the performance needs of our defense and commercial customers. Customers add their own applications and algorithms to our specialized, secure and innovative products and pre-integrated solutions. This allows them to complete their full system by integrating with their platform, the sensor technology and, increasingly, the processing from Mercury.

Our deep, long-standing relationships with leading high-tech and other commercial companies, coupled with our targeted research and development (“R&D”) investments and industry-leading trusted and secure design and manufacturing capabilities, are the foundational tenets of this highly successful model. We are leading the development and adaptation of commercial technology for aerospace and defense solutions. From chip-scale to system scale and from data, including RF to digital to decision, we make mission-critical technologies safe, secure, affordable and relevant for our customers. 
 Our capabilities, technology, people and R&D investment strategy combine to differentiate Mercury in our industry. We maintain our technological edge by investing in critical capabilities and intellectual property (“IP” or “building blocks”) in processing, leveraging open standards and open architectures to adapt quickly those building blocks into solutions for highly data-intensive applications, including emerging needs in areas such as artificial intelligence (“AI”).
As of June 27, 2025, we had 2,162 employees. Our consolidated revenues, net loss, diluted net loss per share, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 were $912.0 million, $(37.9) million, $(0.65), $0.64 and $119.4 million, respectively. Our consolidated revenues, net loss, diluted net loss per share, adjusted loss per share and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 were $835.3 million, $(137.6) million, $(2.38), $(0.69) and $9.4 million, respectively.

On August 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 6 (“Amendment No. 6”) to our credit agreement dated May 2, 2016, as amended to date. Amendment No. 6 permanently decreased borrowing capacity to $900.0 million, with a temporary reduction in credit availability to $750.0 million until we meet a minimum consolidated EBITDA level of $75.0 million excluding (a) adjustments for cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, (b) EAC charges and other non-cash expenses, charges, and losses addbacks and (c) deducts to reverse EAC charges previously added back, in each case for a last twelve-month period. We had $591.5 million in outstanding borrowings both prior to and following the closing of Amendment No. 6. See Note L in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the  Revolver.
On January 29, 2025, we executed a workforce reduction that eliminated approximately 145 positions, which resulted in restructuring charges of $4.9 million for employee separation costs, which costs are classified as restructuring and other charges within our statement of operations and other comprehensive income. The headcount savings, primarily within R&D and cost of revenues, are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately $15 million, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested in the business with the remainder supporting improved profitability and operating leverage for our fiscal year 2026.
On March 28, 2025, we announced the departure of our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, with Mr. Ballhaus, our Chairman and CEO, leading the business operations group, with the group’s senior leaders reporting directly to him. Mr. Farnsworth, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, assumed additional responsibilities including leading a rigorous and focused organization-wide management operating system; actioning a robust and aligned technology investment strategy; overseeing execution related customer engagements; and driving operational performance. 
On April 15, 2025, we entered into a strategic supply agreement under which Cicor Group acquired the Company's manufacturing operations in Plan-Les-Ouates, Switzerland, and exclusively provides contract manufacturing to supply the Company's international operations with electronic products over the next five years.
On April 30, 2025, we completed an asset acquisition of Star Lab, a subsidiary of Wind River Systems, Inc., that provides anti-tamper and cybersecurity software solutions designed to protect mission-critical processors from advanced attacks.

On July 18, 2023, we executed the planned evolution of our 1MPACT value creation initiative, embedding the processes and execution of 1MPACT into our operations organization. The 1MPACT office concluded its responsibilities, having successfully incorporated the principles behind 1MPACT into how we think about continuous improvement at all levels of the Company. 
On August 15, 2023, we announced William L. Ballhaus has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer.
On August 9, 2023, we approved and initiated a workforce reduction that, together with the consolidation of 1MPACT into our operations organization, eliminated approximately 150 positions resulting in $9.5 million of severance costs. Our plan enacted several immediate cost savings measures that simplified our organizational structure, facilitated clearer accountability, and aligned our priorities, including: (i) embedded the 1MPACT value creation initiatives and execution into the Company’s operations; (ii) streamlined organizational structure and removed areas of redundancy between corporate and divisional organizations; and (iii) reduced selling, general, and administrative headcount and rebalanced discretionary and third party spend to better align with our priority areas.

On November 7, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 5 (“Amendment No. 5”) to the Company’s Credit Agreement dated May 2, 2016, as amended to date. Due to the uncertainty surrounding a government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution and the potential impact on the second quarter and fiscal 2024 results, we proactively executed Amendment No. 5 to allow for a temporary increase in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant requirement from 4.50 to 5.25 for the second quarter ended December 29, 2023. As part of Amendment No. 5, we agreed to a temporary reduction of Revolver capacity to $750.0 million through the earlier of May 15, 2024 or the filing of the compliance certificate for the period ended March 29, 2024. We had $576.5 million in outstanding borrowings both prior to and following the closing of Amendment No. 5. See Note L in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the Revolver.
On January 12, 2024, we adopted a plan to consolidate our Mission Systems and Microelectronics divisions into one unified structure that incorporates multiple business units and functions, under the leadership of an Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer effective as of January 22, 2024. This consolidation was designed to simplify our organizational structure, facilitate clearer accountability, and align to our priorities. On January 12, 2024, we approved and initiated workforce reductions that eliminated approximately 100 positions resulting in an additional $9,841 of severance costs for fiscal 2024. See Note H in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussions of restructuring charges incurred during the year.
On June 17, 2024, we approved the next phase of our consolidation efforts and implemented a workforce reduction that eliminated approximately 100 positions and resulted in restructuring charges of $6,781 for employee separation costs. See Note H in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussions of restructuring charges incurred during the year.

Total revenues increased $76.7 million, or 9.2%, to $912.0 million during fiscal 2025, as compared to $835.3 million during fiscal 2024. Revenues increased year over year as we pivoted our resources in fiscal 2025 to executing on our program base, including progress toward full rate production of our common processing architecture programs, following the prioritization of resources to execute our challenged programs in fiscal 2024. Point in time revenue and over time revenue represented 53% and 47%, respectively, of total revenue during fiscal 2025. Point in time revenue increased $112.3 million and

Table of Contents
over time revenue decreased $35.5 million as we transitioned many of our development programs to production. Point in time revenue and over time revenue represented 45% and 55%, respectively, of total revenues during fiscal 2024. 
We experienced revenue increases across the modules and sub-assemblies and integrated solutions product groupings of $60.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease to the components product grouping of $2.5 million. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by the radar, other, and C4I end applications increases of $67.7 million, $34.4 million, and $15.1 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases to other sensor and effector and electronic warfare end applications of $30.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. We experienced increases across several of our platforms during fiscal 2025 when compared to fiscal 2024; Land, Other, and Naval platforms increased $50.5 million, $43.5 million, and $7.9 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases to Airborne and Space platforms of $20.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The largest program increases were related to LTAMDS, KC-46, MH-60R/S, THAAD and a secure processing program, partially offset by decreases to the SCAR and ADTS programs when compared to the prior period. There were no programs comprising 10% or more of our revenues for fiscal 2025 or 2024.

Gross margin was 27.9% for fiscal 2025, an increase of 440 basis points from the 23.5% gross margin realized during fiscal 2024. The higher gross margin was primarily driven by net EAC change impact on our programs recognized over time of $21.1 million recorded in the period, an incremental improvement of approximately $52.2 million, or 650 basis points, when compared to the prior period as well as lower manufacturing adjustments of $16.4 million, related to inventory reserves, warranty expense, and certain other non-recurring cost adjustments. We may experience increases in our manufacturing costs related to the imposition of tariffs on the import of components from other countries. See
