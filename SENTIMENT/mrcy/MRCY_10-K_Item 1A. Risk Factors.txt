Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 7.4%, to $154.4 million during fiscal 2025 as compared to $166.8 million during fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the full year impact of the reduction in force initiated in fiscal 2024, resulting in lower compensation costs of $14.4 million. There were also reductions in bad debt expense and software licensing fees of $14.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by higher litigation and settlement, bonus, and consulting expense of $9.9 million, $5.0 million, and $1.8 million, respectively.

Research and development expenses decreased $33.7 million, or 33.3%, to $67.6 million during fiscal 2025, as compared to $101.3 million for fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the savings from headcount reductions of 211 employees, resulting in lower expense of $25.8 million. There were also reductions in consulting and outside service, equipment and supplies, and depreciation expense of $8.8 million, $4.2 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, partially offset by higher bonus expense of $5.9 million.

The acquisition costs and other related expenses we incurred during fiscal 2025 includes $1.4 million related to the sale of our manufacturing operations in Plan-Les-Ouates, Switzerland and the associated supply agreement with Cicor Group and $0.6 million related to run-rate amortization of fair value adjustments from purchase accounting on prior acquisitions. 
Acquisition costs during fiscal 2024 were primarily included $0.7 million related to run-rate amortization of fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, $0.3 million related to the conclusion of the Board of Directors' review of strategic alternatives, as well as $0.3 million for third-party advisory fees in connection with engagements by activist investors.
We could incur acquisition costs and other related expenses periodically in the future as we continue to seek acquisition opportunities to expand our technological capabilities and especially within the sensor and effector and C4I markets. Transaction costs incurred by the acquiree prior to the consummation of an acquisition would not be reflected in our historical results of operations.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $12.5 million and $51.6 million on losses before income taxes of $50.4 million and $189.3 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits, changes to reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits and state taxes, partially offset by nondeductible compensation and tax provisions related to stock compensation.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits and state taxes, partially offset by tax provisions related to stock compensation. 
We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the majority of our state research and development tax credit carryforwards. The realizability of deferred tax assets is continuously monitored, and the need for a valuation allowance is reassessed each reporting period based on the best available information. While sufficient taxable income to utilize the remainder of deferred tax assets is currently projected, changes to our forecast could lead to the establishment of a valuation allowance in future periods.

On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted, which includes a broad range of tax provisions and extended and modified certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), including, but not limited to, restoration of 100% bonus depreciation, EBITDA-based interest expense limitation and immediate expensing of domestic research and development expenditures. Due to the timing of the bill being enacted after fiscal 2025, the impact of the OBBBA will be reflected in fiscal 2026. We are evaluating the impacts of this legislation on future periods.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary sources of liquidity come from existing cash and cash generated from operations, our Revolver, and our ability to raise capital under our universal shelf registration statement. Our near-term fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. During fiscal 2024, our working capital decreased primarily related to unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. As we completed our challenged programs and received follow-on production awards, both our unbilled receivables and inventory have begun converting to cash, which is reducing our working capital balances. During fiscal 2025, our working capital balance declined $90.1 million compared to the prior year.
Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, our available Revolver, cash generated from operations and our financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Shelf Registration Statement
On October 4, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC. The shelf registration statement, which was effective upon filing with the SEC, registered each of the following securities: debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants and units. We intend to use the proceeds from financings using the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, which may include the following:
•
the acquisition of other companies or businesses;
•
the repayment and refinancing of debt;
•
capital expenditures;
•
working capital; and
•
other purposes as described in the prospectus supplement.
We have an unlimited amount available under the shelf registration statement.  
Revolving Credit Facilities
On November 7, 2023, due to the uncertainty surrounding a government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution and the potential impact on the second quarter and fiscal 2024 results, we proactively executed Amendment No. 5 to the Revolver, as amended to date, with a syndicate of commercial banks and Bank of America, N.A acting as the administrative agent allowing for a temporary increase in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant requirement from 4.50 to 5.25 for the second quarter ended December 29, 2023. As part of Amendment No. 5, we agreed to a temporary reduction of Revolver capacity to $750.0 million through the earlier of May 15, 2024 or the filing of the compliance certificate for the period ended March 29, 2024.
On August 13, 2024, we executed Amendment No. 6 to the Revolver, decreasing the permanent borrowing capacity to $900.0 million, with a temporary reduction in credit availability to $750.0 million until we met a minimum consolidated EBITDA level of $75.0 million excluding (a) adjustments for cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, (b) EAC charges and other non-cash expenses, charges, and losses addbacks and (c) deducts to reverse EAC charges previously added back, in each case for a last twelve-month period. The temporary reduction in credit availability was removed as of the filing of our fiscal 2025 Q2 compliance certificate, and capacity returned to $900 million.

During fiscal 2025, we did not have any additional borrowings or repayments. As of June 27, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the Revolver. The borrowing capacity as defined under the Revolver as of June 27, 2025 is approximately $900.0 million, less outstanding borrowings of $591.5 million. See Note L in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Revolver.
Receivables Purchase Agreement
On September 27, 2022, we entered into an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement (“RPA”), pursuant to which we could offer to sell certain customer receivables, subject to the terms and conditions of the RPA. On August 13, 2024, we terminated the RPA in conjunction with entering into a new receivables purchase and service agreement.

Table of Contents
On August 13, 2024, we entered into a $60.0 million committed receivables purchase and servicing agreement (“RPSA”) with a new party. The RPSA has an initial term of two years. Pursuant to the RPSA, the new party has committed to purchase receivables at a discount from a list of certain of our customers, maintaining a balance of purchased receivables at or below $60 million. We had $52.2 million of factored accounts receivable as of June 27, 2025 and incurred factoring fees of approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2025. We had $33.8 million of factored accounts receivable as of June 28, 2024 and incurred factoring fees of approximately $1.9 million in fiscal 2024.

Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $128.6 million during fiscal 2025 primarily as the result of $138.9 million provided by operating activities, $6.2 million of proceeds from sale of manufacturing operations to Cicor Group, $3.7 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, $2.7 million provided by the sale of our mc.com domain name, and $1.9 million provided by other investing activities. These inflows were partially offset by $19.8 million invested in purchases of property and equipment, $4.5 million of cash paid in the asset acquisition of Star Lab and $2.2 million of cash paid in deferred financing and offering costs.
Operating Activities
During fiscal 2025, we had an inflow of $138.9 million in cash from operating activities compared to a $60.4 million inflow during fiscal 2024. The increase during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a lower net loss of $99.7 million, higher inflow from deferred revenues and customer advances of $32.6 million, lower outflow from the benefit for deferred income taxes of $20.9 million, a higher inflow from other non-current assets of $8.1 million and an inflow from accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued compensation of $8.1 million, as compared to an outflow of $0.7 million due to accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued compensation in the prior period. This activity was partially offset by a lower inflow from accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and costs in excess of billings of $46.5 million and a lower provision for bad debt of $14.4 million. Fiscal 2024 also included a $7.4 million inflow from the cash settlement for the termination of the interest rate swap.
Investing Activities
During fiscal 2025, we invested $13.5 million, a decrease of $20.8 million, as compared to $34.3 million during fiscal 2024 primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment of $14.5 million, the proceeds from the sale of manufacturing operations to Cicor Group of $6.2 million, $2.7 million provided by the sale of mc.com, and an inflow of $1.9 million provided by other investing activities, partially offset by $4.5 million of cash paid in the asset acquisition of Star Lab. 
Financing Activities
During fiscal 2025, we had $1.4 million in cash provided by financing activities, as compared to $82.7 million during fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, we made no borrowings or repayments on the Revolver, as compared to net borrowings of $80.0 million during fiscal 2024. Fiscal 2025 included $3.7 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by $2.2 million of cash paid in deferred financing in conjunction with the amendment to our Revolver during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

Purchase obligations represent open non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components and services used in normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements aggregated $206.4 million at June 27, 2025. A component of the sale of manufacturing operations to Cicor Group is a commitment to purchase $50.0 million of inventory from the Cicor Group over the next five years.
We had a liability at June 27, 2025 of $4.0 million for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. We do not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, do not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the above table.
Our standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited.
As part of our strategy for growth, we continue to explore acquisitions or strategic alliances. The associated acquisition costs incurred in the form of professional fees and services may be material to the future periods in which they occur, regardless of whether the acquisition is ultimately completed. 
We may elect from time to time to purchase and subsequently retire shares of common stock in order to settle employees’ tax liabilities associated with vesting of a restricted stock award. These transactions would be treated as a use of cash in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

RRANGEMENTS
Other than certain indemnification provisions, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During fiscal 2025 and 2024, we did not engage in any related party transactions.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In our periodic communications, we discuss certain important measures that are not calculated according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, and free cash flow.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before other non-operating adjustments, interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, COVID related expenses, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. We use adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining a portion of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and

Table of Contents
information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.
The following table reconciles our net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to our adjusted EBITDA:

These charges are typically related to acquisitions and organizational redesign programs initiated as part of discrete post-acquisition integration activities. We believe these items are non-routine and may not be indicative of ongoing operating results.
(2) Acquisition, financing and other third party costs for fiscal 2025 are related to costs associated with the sale of manufacturing operations to Cicor Group and financing costs.
(3) Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company increased the rate of its matching contributions from 3% to 6% of participants' eligible annual compensation and changed the form of these contributions from cash to company stock. Fiscal 2023 also includes forfeitures of $6.8 million of stock-based compensation from the Company's former CEO's resignation.
Adjusted income and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We use these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define adjusted income as net income before other non-operating adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, COVID related expenses, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
Adjusted income and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

Fiscal 2023 also includes forfeitures of $6.8 million of stock-based compensation from the Company's former CEO's resignation.
(4) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the add-backs involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision. 
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow adjustment described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of our obligations which require cash.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. We believe the following critical accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most subjective judgment.

ECOGNITION
We recognize revenue at a point in time or over time as the performance obligations are met. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Contracts with distinct performance obligations recognized at a point in time, with or without an allocation of the transaction price, totaled 53% and 45% of revenues for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. Total revenue recognized under contracts over time was 47% and 55% of revenues for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. 
Revenue recognized at a point in time generally relates to contracts that include a combination of components, modules and sub-assemblies, integrated subsystems and related system integration or other services. Revenue is recognized at a point in time for these products and services (versus over time recognition) due to the following: (i) customers are only able to consume the benefits provided by us upon completion of the product or service; (ii) customers do not control the product or service prior to completion; and (iii) we do not have an enforceable right to payment at all times for performance completed to date. Accordingly, there is little judgment in determining when control of the good or service transfers to the customer, and revenue is recognized upon shipment (for goods) or completion (for services).
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Standalone selling prices of our goods and services are generally not directly observable. Accordingly, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. The objective of the expected cost plus a margin approach is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis. Our determination of the expected cost plus a margin approach involves the consideration of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each contract. Specifically, we consider the cost to produce the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar parts, our ongoing pricing strategy and policies, often based on the price list established and updated by management on a regular basis, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold.
Revenue is recognized over time (versus point in time recognition) for long-term contracts with development, production and service activities where the performance obligations are satisfied over time. These over time contracts involve the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex modules and sub-assemblies or integrated subsystems and related services. Revenue is recognized over time, given: (i) our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or (ii) our performance creates an asset with no alternative use to us and (iii) we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. These contracts include both fixed-price and cost reimbursable contracts. Our cost reimbursable contracts typically include cost-plus fixed fee and time and material (“T&M”) contracts. We consider whether contracts should be combined or segmented, and based on this assessment, we combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single contract, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, we may separate an arrangement, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement and the related performance criteria were negotiated. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period. For all types of contracts, we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable. These losses are recognized in advance of contract performance and as of June 27, 2025, approximately $4.5 million of these costs were in Accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
For over time contracts, we typically leverage the input method, using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. We believe that this method represents the most faithful depiction of our performance because it directly measures value transferred to the customer. Contract estimates and estimates of any variable consideration are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that may span several years. These assumptions include: the amount of time to complete the contract, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the availability of subcontractor services and materials; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We bear the 
39
Table of Contents
risk of changes in estimates to complete on a fixed-price contract which may cause profit levels to vary from period to period. For cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. In the limited instances where we enter into T&M contracts, revenue recognized reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate, as well as reimbursement of other direct billable costs. For T&M contracts, we elected to use a practical expedient permitted by ASC 606 whereby revenue is recognized in the amount for which we have a right to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer. For over time contracts, we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable.
Accounting for contracts recognized over time requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs, in particular, assumptions relative to the amount of time to complete the contract, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. Our estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each over time contract monthly to assess the contract’s schedule, performance, technical matters and estimated cost at completion. Changes in estimates are applied retrospectively and when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified, such revisions may result in current period adjustments to earnings applicable to performance in prior periods. 
We generally do not provide our customers with rights of product return other than those related to assurance warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods over a period of 12 to 36 months. We accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment. We do not consider activities related to such assurance warranties, if any, to be a separate performance obligation. We offer separately priced extended warranties which generally range from 12 to 36 months that are treated as separate performance obligations. The transaction price allocated to extended warranties is recognized over time in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. 
On over time contracts, the portion of the payments retained by the customer is not considered a significant financing component because most contracts have a duration of less than one year and payment is received as progress is made. Many of our over time contracts have milestone payments, which align the payment schedule with the progress towards completion on the performance obligation. On some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment, which is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to facilitate inventory demands at the onset of a contract and to safeguard us from the failure of the other party to abide by some or all of their obligations under the contract.
We define service revenues as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development, production, or delivery of tangible assets, software or specific capabilities sold by us. Examples of our service revenues include: analyst services and systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. We combine our product and service revenues into a single class as services revenues are less than 10 percent of total revenues.

We value our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or its net realizable value. We write down inventory for excess and obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Actual demand, product mix and alternative usage may be higher or lower resulting in variations in on our gross margin.

We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and in any interim period in which events or circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, a decline in our market capitalization, the loss of significant business, significant decreases in funding for our contracts, or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. 
We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill impairment guidance provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly known as “step zero”) to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the two-step test. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments by management about macro-economic conditions including our operating environment, industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel, and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If we conclude that further testing is required, the impairment test is completed. Step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates. The discount rates used in the DCF model were based on a weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”) determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period, which reflects our estimate of stable, perpetual growth. We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach. Finally, we 
40
Table of Contents
compared the estimates of our fair values to our total market capitalization to assess the reasonableness of our reporting units’ combined determined fair value.
 Key assumptions of the forecast model over expected revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates are subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity. We make every effort to forecast future financial performance as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed. These assumptions were reviewed by management and compared to assumptions used in prior analyses and were deemed reasonable. There were no material changes in the key assumptions during the periods presented. 
There are inherent uncertainties and management judgement required in these determinations and risks to the forecast included but are not limited to program/product execution, transition from development to production programs, industry related make-buy decisions, and global market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment. We continuously monitor and evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance and expectations of projected financial performance and cash flows, and changes in our stock price in relation to the carrying value of its reporting units, among other relevant factors. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require us to perform an interim impairment assessment and record an impairment charge. In addition, we use the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions of the income approach.
The Company utilizes the management approach for determining its operating segment in accordance with ASC 280. There has been no change to the Company's conclusion of one operating and reportable segment in fiscal 2025.
In accordance with FASB ASC 350, 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
 (“ASC 350”), the Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results of the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. Component level financial information is reviewed by management across two divisions: Microelectronics, and Mission Systems. Accordingly, these were determined to be the Company's reporting units. 
As part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, we utilized a discount rate for each of our reporting units, as defined by ASC 350, that we believe represents the risks that our businesses face, considering their sizes, the current economic environment, and other industry data we believe is appropriate. The discount rates for Microelectronics and Mission Systems were 9.5%, and 9.0%, respectively. The annual testing indicated that the fair values of our Microelectronics and Mission Systems reporting unit had an estimated fair value substantially in excess of their carrying values, and thus no further testing was required.
We also review finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist, such as a significant reduction in undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. Should the fair value of our finite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary.

The determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deductions and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used for which a reserve has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
We use a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon

Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to our investment portfolio and the Revolver. 
Our investment portfolio includes money market funds from high quality U.S. government issuers. A change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises, the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, investments are generally available for sale and we generally limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For our variable rate borrowings, we may use a fixed interest rate swap, effectively converting a portion of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. We utilize interest rate derivatives to mitigate interest rate exposure with respect to our financing arrangements. There were $591.5 million of outstanding borrowings against the Revolver at June 27, 2025.

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit quality. As of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, we had $309.1 million and $180.5 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or invested with our financial and lending institutions.
We provide credit to customers in the normal course of business. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. As of June 27, 2025, five customers accounted for 48% of our receivables, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. As of June 28, 2024, five customers accounted for 51% of our receivables, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings.

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we conduct business outside the United States through our foreign subsidiaries in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Spain where business is largely transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in the exchange rates of local currencies. Local currencies are used as the functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Consequently, changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ statements of operations into U.S. dollars, which may in turn affect our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
We have not entered into any financial derivative instruments that expose us to material market risk, including any instruments designed to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures. We may, however, hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future.

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mercury Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 27, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 27, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Estimate of total contract costs to be incurred for certain fixed price contract revenue recognized over time
As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, revenue recognized over time for the year ended June 27, 2025 represented 47% of total revenues. For contracts where revenue is recognized over time under fixed price arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue based on the ratio of (1) actual contract costs incurred to date to (2) the Company’s estimate of total contract costs to be incurred.
We identified the evaluation of total contract costs to be incurred for certain fixed price contract revenue recognized over time as a critical audit matter given the complex nature of the Company’s products sold under such contracts. In particular, evaluating the Company’s judgments regarding the amount of time to complete the contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop estimates of total contract costs to be incurred for partially completed performance obligations. This included controls related to the estimated amount of time to complete the contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. We considered factors, including the value and stage of completion, to select certain customers’ contracts to evaluate the Company’s assumptions underlying the estimate of total contract costs to be incurred. We inspected the selected contracts to evaluate the Company’s identification of performance obligations and the determined method for measuring contract progress. We compared the Company’s original or prior period estimate of total contract costs to be incurred to the actual costs incurred for completed contracts to assess the Company’s ability to accurately estimate costs. We inquired of operational personnel of the Company to evaluate progress to date, the estimate of remaining costs to be incurred, and factors impacting the amount of time and cost to complete the selected contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. We inspected correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customers for the selected contracts as part of our evaluation of contract progress.

STIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
B
USINESS
 C
OMBINATIONS
The Company utilizes the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, 
Business Combinations,
 (“ASC 805”), for all transactions and events in which it obtains control over one or more other businesses, to recognize the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired, even if less than one hundred percent ownership is acquired, and in establishing the acquisition date fair value as of the measurement date for all assets and liabilities assumed. The Company also utilizes ASC 805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. Other estimates include: 
•
estimated step-ups for fixed assets and inventory;
•
estimated fair values of intangible assets; and
•
estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquiree.
While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date, the estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the purchase price allocation period, which is generally one year from the business acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. For changes in the valuation of intangible assets between the preliminary and final purchase price allocation, the related amortization is adjusted in the period it occurs. Subsequent to the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to assets acquired or liabilities assumed is included in operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined.

EASES
The Company measures its lease obligations in accordance with ASC 842,
 Leases
, (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for most lease arrangements.
The Company has arrangements involving the lease of facilities. Under ASC 842, at inception of the arrangement, the Company determines whether the contract is or contains a lease and whether the lease should be classified as an operating or a financing lease. This determination, among other considerations, involves an assessment of whether the Company can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. 
The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities as of the lease commencement date based on the net present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. ASC 842 requires lessees to use the rate implicit in the lease unless it is not readily determinable and then it may use its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to discount the future minimum lease payments. Most of the Company's lease arrangements do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its IBR to discount the future minimum lease payments. The Company determines its IBR with its credit rating and current economic information available as of the commencement date, as well as the identified lease term. During the assessment of the lease term, the Company considers its renewal options and extensions within the arrangements and the Company includes these options when it is reasonably certain to extend the term of the lease. 
The Company has lease arrangements with both lease and non-lease components. Consideration is allocated to lease and non-lease components based on estimated standalone prices. The Company has elected to exclude non-lease components from the calculation of its ROU assets and lease liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less do not result in recognition of a ROU asset and a lease liability and will be expensed as incurred over the lease term. Leases of this nature were immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company has lease arrangements that contain incentives for tenant improvements as well as fixed rent escalation clauses. For contracts with tenant improvement incentives that are determined to be a leasehold improvement that will be owned by the lessee and the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, it records a reduction to the lease liability and amortizes the incentive over the identified term of the lease as a reduction to rent expense. The Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the identified lease term on contracts with rent escalation clauses. 
Finance leases are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements and the Company is not a lessor in any material lease arrangements. There are no material restrictions, covenants, sale and leaseback transactions, variable lease payments or residual value guarantees in the Company's lease arrangements. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, net, Accrued expenses, and Operating lease liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our obligations under leases.
R
EVENUE
 R
ECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the five step model set forth by ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, (“ASC 606”), which involves identification of the contract(s), identification of performance obligations in the contract, determination of the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price to the previously identified performance obligations, and revenue recognition as the performance obligations are satisfied. 
During step one of the five step model, the Company considers whether contracts should be combined or segmented, and based on this assessment, the Company combines closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single contract, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, the Company may separate an arrangement, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement and the related performance criteria were negotiated. The conclusion to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period. 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Certain contracts with customers require the Company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the Company’s published product specifications and, on occasion, with additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases, the Company conducts such tests and, if they are completed successfully, includes a written confirmation with each order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of acceptance by its customer. The Company's contracts with customers generally do not include a right of return relative to delivered products. In certain cases, contracts are modified to account for changes in the contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Certain contracts with customers have options for the customer 
50
Table of Contents
to acquire additional goods or services. In most cases the pricing of these options are reflective of the standalone selling price of the good or service. These options do not provide the customer with a material right and are accounted for only when the customer exercises the option to purchase the additional goods or services. If the option on the customer contract was not indicative of the standalone selling price of the good or service, the material right would be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. 
The Company is a leading technology company serving the aerospace and defense industry, positioned at the intersection of high-tech and defense. Revenues are derived from the sales of products that are grouped into one of the following three categories: (i) components; (ii) modules and sub-assemblies; and (iii) integrated solutions. The Company also generates revenues from the performance of services, including systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. Each promised good or service within a contract is accounted for separately under the guidance of ASC 606 if they are distinct. Promised goods or services not meeting the criteria for being a distinct performance obligation are bundled into a single performance obligation with other goods or services that together meet the criteria for being distinct. The appropriate allocation of the transaction price and recognition of revenue is then determined for the bundled performance obligation.
Once the Company identifies the performance obligations, the Company then determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. Variable consideration typically arises due to volume discounts, or other provisions that can either decrease or increase the transaction price. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the method the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. The determination of the estimates for variable consideration require judgment, and are based on past history with similar contracts and anticipated performance. Further, variable consideration is only included in the determination of the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur. There are no constraints on the variable consideration recorded.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Standalone selling prices of the Company’s goods and services are generally not directly observable. Accordingly, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which the Company estimates the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. The objective of the expected cost plus a margin approach is to determine the price at which the Company would transact if the product or service were sold by the Company on a standalone basis. The Company's determination of the expected cost plus a margin approach involves the consideration of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each contract. Specifically, the Company considers the cost to produce the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar parts, the Company’s ongoing pricing strategy and policies, often based on the price list established and updated by management on a regular basis, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold.
The Company analyzes the standalone selling prices used in its allocation of transaction price on contracts at least annually. Standalone selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in the Company’s business necessitates a more frequent analysis or if the Company experiences significant variances in its selling prices.
Revenue recognized at a point in time generally relates to contracts that include a combination of components, modules and sub-assemblies, integrated solutions and related system integration or other services. Contracts with distinct performance obligations recognized at a point in time, with or without an allocation of the transaction price, totaled 
53
%, 
45
% and 
44
% of revenues in the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025, June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue is recognized at a point in time for these products and services (versus over time recognition) due to the following: (i) customers are only able to consume the benefits provided by the Company upon completion of the product or service; (ii) customers do not control the product or service prior to completion; and (iii) the Company does not have an enforceable right to payment at all times for performance completed to date. Accordingly, there is little judgment in determining when control of the good or service transfers to the customer, and revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control (for goods) or completion (for services).
The Company engages in contracts for development, production and service activities and recognizes revenue for performance obligations over time. These over time contracts involve the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex modules and sub-assemblies or integrated subsystems and related services. Revenue is recognized over time, due to the fact that: (i) the Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; and (ii) the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The Company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. These contracts 
51
Table of Contents
include both fixed-price and cost reimbursable contracts. The Company’s cost reimbursable contracts typically include cost-plus fixed fee and time and material (“T&M”) contracts.
For over time contracts, the Company typically leverages the input method, using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. The Company believes that this method represents the most faithful depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures value transferred to the customer. Contract estimates and estimates of any variable consideration are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that may span several years. These assumptions include: the amount of time to complete the contract, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the availability of subcontractor services and materials; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. The Company bears the risk of changes in estimates to complete on a fixed-price contract which may cause profit levels to vary from period to period. For cost reimbursable contracts, the Company is reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. In the limited instances where the Company enters into T&M contracts, revenue recognized reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate, as well as reimbursement of other direct billable costs. For T&M contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount for which the Company has a right to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer. For over time contracts, the Company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable.
Total revenue recognized under over time contracts was 
47
%, 
55
% and 
56
% of revenues in the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025, June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.
Accounting for contracts recognized over time requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs, in particular, assumptions relative to the amount of time to complete the contract, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of contract amendments which may result in cumulative adjustments. The Company’s estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each over time contract monthly to assess the contract’s schedule, performance, technical matters and estimated cost at completion. Changes in estimates are applied retrospectively and when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified, such revisions may result in current period adjustments to earnings applicable to performance in prior periods. The aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes across the Company’s portfolio of programs can have a significant effect upon its reported Loss from operations, Net loss and Diluted net loss per share in each of the reporting periods. The net impact of changes in estimates had the following impact on the Company’s operating results:

The Company generally does not provide its customers with rights of product return other than those related to assurance warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods over a period of 
12
 to 
36
 months. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment. The Company does not consider activities related to such assurance warranties, if any, to be a separate performance obligation. The Company does offer separately priced extended warranties which generally range from 
12
 to 
36
 months that are treated as separate performance obligations. The transaction price allocated to extended warranties is recognized over time in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. 
On over time contracts, the portion of the payments retained by the customer is not considered a significant financing component because most contracts have a duration of less than one year and payment is received as progress is made. Many of the Company's over time contracts have milestone payments, which align the payment schedule with the progress towards completion on the performance obligation. On some contracts, the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment, which is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to facilitate inventory demands at the onset of a contract and to safeguard the Company from the failure of the other party to abide by some or all of their obligations under the contract.
 All revenues are reported net of government assessed taxes (e.g., sales taxes or value-added taxes).

Contract balances result from the timing of revenue recognized, billings and cash collections, and the generation of contract assets and liabilities. Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced to the customer and the right to payment is not subject to the passage of time. Contract assets are presented as unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings, net of allowance for credit losses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities consist of deferred product revenue, billings in excess of revenues, deferred service revenue, and customer advances. Deferred product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because the Company has not satisfied its performance obligations under the contract. Billings in excess of revenues represents milestone billing contracts where the billings of the contract exceed recognized revenues. Deferred service revenue primarily represents amounts invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts or extended warranty contracts, which are recognized over time in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order. Contract liabilities are included in deferred revenue and the long-term portion of deferred revenue is included within other non-current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract balances are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis.

The contract asset balances were $
278,475
 and $
304,029
 as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The contract asset balance decreased due to $
452,171
 of billings, offset by revenue recognized under over time contracts of $
426,617
 during the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025. The contract liability balances were $
127,605
 and $
74,367
 as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The contract liability increased due to a higher volume of advanced milestone billing events as well as timing of revenue recognized across multiple programs.

Accounts receivable, net, represents amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended as necessary. The allowance is based upon an assessment of the customer's credit worthiness, reasonable forecasts about the future, history with the customer, recovery of balances from contract settlements, and the age of the receivable balance. The Company typically invoices a customer upon shipment of the product (or completion of a service) for contracts where revenue is recognized at a point in time. For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, the invoicing events are typically based on specified performance obligation deliverables or milestone events, or quantifiable measures of performance.

On September 27, 2022, the Company executed an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement (“RPA”), pursuant to which the Company could offer to sell certain customer receivables, subject to the terms and conditions of the RPA. 
On August 13, 2024, the Company terminated the RPA in conjunction with entering into a new receivables purchase and service agreement.
On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a $
60,000
 committed receivables purchase and servicing agreement (“RPSA”) with a new party. The RPSA has an initial term of two years. Pursuant to the RPSA, the new party has committed to purchase receivables at a discount from a list of certain of the Company’s customers, maintaining a balance of purchased receivables at or below $
60,000
. Under the RPSA, a portion of the factored receivables is paid by the counterparty in cash and classified as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid as receivables are collected by the Company.
Proceeds for amounts factored by the Company are recorded as an incr
ease to cash and a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash flows attributable to factored receivables are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Factoring fees are included as Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's

The Company measures at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, restricted cash, interest rate derivatives, and contingent consideration. ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures
, specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy:
Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

NVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value, and consists of materials, labor and overhead. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates inventory for net realizable value. Once an item is written down, the value becomes the new inventory cost basis. The Company reduces the value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand and non-cancelable on-order inventory in excess of estimated usage. The excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses.

SSETS
Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase (see Note F). In accordance with the requirements of Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or when events and circumstances ("triggering event") occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. Potential triggering events include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance and expectations of projected financial performance and cash flows, and changes in the Company's stock price in relation to the carrying value of its reporting units, among other relevant factors. Adverse changes to these events and circumstances could require the Company to perform an interim impairment test. 
Intangible assets result from the Company’s various business acquisitions (see Note G) and certain licensed technologies, and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including completed technology, licensing agreements, patents, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to 
12.5
 years or over the period the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.

Long-lived assets primarily include property and equipment, intangible assets and ROU assets. The Company regularly evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with ASC 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
 (“ASC 360”). The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
Property and equipment are the long-lived, physical assets of the Company acquired for use in the Company’s normal business operations and are not intended for resale by the Company. These assets are recorded at cost. Renewals and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures that increase the efficiency of the assets are expensed as incurred. Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method (see Note E).
As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally 
three years
. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for material and services and certain payroll and related fringe benefit costs are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized $

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”). The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
ASC 740 requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 
50
% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, restricted cash, accounts receivable and payable, contract assets and liabilities and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The Company determined the carrying value of long-term debt approximated fair value due to variable interest rates charged on the borrowings, which reprice frequently. 
During the first quarter ended September 29, 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate hedging agreement (the “September 2023 Swap”). 
The fair value of the September 2023 Swap is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivative, leveraging observable inputs other than quoted prices, such as interest rates. As of June 27, 2025, the fair value of the September 2023 Swap was a liability of $

Goodwill

In accordance with FASB ASC 350, 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other 
(“ASC 350”), the Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results of the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. Component level financial information is reviewed by management across two reporting units: Mission Systems and Microelectronics. Accordingly, these were determined to be the Company's reporting units which is consistent with the prior period. There were no adjustments to the carrying value of Goodwill during fiscal 2025 and 2024.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Based on the quantitative evaluation, the Company determined that the Mission Systems and Microelectronics reporting units had estimated fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values. The Company concluded that its goodwill was not impaired. 
The Company is required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026. Adverse changes to the underlying information assumptions used in its assessment of potential triggering events could require the Company to perform an interim impairment test. If assumed revenue growth rate and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or the Company’s common stock price significantly declines from current levels, among other factors, its Mission Systems and Microelectronics reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. Any impairment charges that the Company may record in the future could be material to its results of operations and financial condition.

The Company reviews net intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. Based on the Company’s last assessment, the Company believes that the carrying values of net intangible assets were recoverable as of June 27, 2025. However, if business conditions deteriorate, the Company may be required to record impairment losses, and or increase the amortization of intangibles in the future. Any impairment charges that the Company may record in the future could be material to the results of operations and financial condition.
During fiscal 2025, the Company acquired completed technologies of $
4,866
 with a useful life of 
7.5
 years in connection with the Company's asset acquisition of Star Lab.
H.
Restructuring
During fiscal 2025, the Company incurred $
7,216
 of restructuring charges in connection with workforce reductions that eliminated approximately 
145
 positions.
The Company incurs restructuring and other charges in connection with management's decision to undertake certain actions to realign operating expenses through workforce reductions and the closure of certain Company facilities, businesses and product lines. The Company's adjustments reflected in restructuring and other charges are typically related to organizational redesign programs or discrete post-acquisition integration activities initiated as part of discrete post acquisition integration activities.

Table of Contents
During fiscal 2024, the Company initiated several immediate cost savings measures that simplify the Company’s organizational structure, facilitate clearer accountability, and align to the Company’s priorities, including: (i) embedding the 1MPACT value creation initiatives and execution into the Company’s operations; (ii) streamlining organizational structure and removing areas of redundancy between corporate and divisional organizations; and (iii) reducing selling, general, and administrative headcount and rebalancing discretionary and third party spending to better align with the Company’s priority areas. On July 20, 2023, the Company executed the plan to embed the 1MPACT value creation initiatives into operations. On August 9, 2023, the Company approved and initiated a workforce reduction that, together with the 1MPACT related action, eliminated approximately 
150
 positions resulting in $
9,548
 of severance costs during fiscal 2024. On January 12, 2024, the Company approved and initiated workforce reductions that eliminated approximately 
100
 positions resulting in an additional $
9,841
 of severance costs during fiscal 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Company approved and initiated workforce reductions that eliminated an additional 
100
 positions, resulting in an additional $
6,781
 of severance costs in fiscal 2024. The workforce reductions that eliminated approximately 
350
 positions in fiscal 2024 were across manufacturing, SG&A and R&D based on ongoing talent and workforce optimization efforts.
All of the restructuring and other charges are classified as Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income and any remaining severance obligations are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. The remaining restructuring liability is classified as Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits, releases to reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits and state taxes, partially offset by tax provisions related to stock compensation.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits and state taxes, partially offset by tax provisions related to stock compensation.
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits, releases to reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits and state taxes, partially offset by valuation allowances recorded and tax provisions related to stock compensation.

Commitments and Contingencies

 C
LAIMS
The Company is subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against the Company and intends to defend itself vigorously. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations, or financial position. 
On December 7, 2021, counsel for National Technical Systems, Inc. (“NTS”) sent the Company an environmental demand letter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A, and CERCLA 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, related to a site that NTS formerly owned at 533 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts. NTS received a Notice of Responsibility from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”) alleging trichloroethene, freon and 1,4-dioxane contamination in the groundwater emanating from NTS’s former site. NTS alleges in its demand letter that the operations of a predecessor company to Mercury that was acquired in the Company's acquisition of the Microsemi Carve-Out Business that once owned and operated a facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts contributed to the groundwater contamination. NTS is seeking payment from the Company of NTS’s costs for any required environmental remediation. In April 2022, the Company engaged in a meet and confer session with NTS pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A to discuss the status of the environmental review performed by NTS and its licensed site professional. The Company subsequently delivered a letter to NTS outlining the deficiencies in their claim and reiterated that the Company is not obligated to tender a substantive response to their demand without first having received the responsive information requested in connection with the meet and confer session. In April 2024, counsel for NTS sent additional communications on their demand that the Company participate in their environmental monitoring and remediation planning, and in May 2024, the Company responded with a rebuttal of the allegations. The Company believes the NTS claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. In addition, in November 2021, the Company responded to a request for information from MassDEP regarding the detection of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroakyl substances) in the Acton, Massachusetts Water District’s Conant public water supply wells near the former facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts at a level above the standard that MassDEP published for PFAS in October 2020. The Company has not been contacted by MassDEP since the response was provided in November 2021. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, the Company may have for these environmental matters. While the Company has not received any communications on these environmental matters in over a year, the Company assesses them each quarter and plans to only continue reporting updates in the Company's quarterly reports only when there is an update on the claims.
On June 19, 2023, the Board of Directors received notice of the Company's former CEO’s resignation from his positions of President and Chief Executive Officer. The Board accepted his resignation effective June 24, 2023. In his notice, the former CEO claimed he was entitled to certain benefits, including equity vesting, severance, and other benefits, under his change in control severance agreement (the “CIC Agreement”) because he had resigned with good reason during a potential change in control period. The Company disputes these claims and maintains that he resigned without good reason. On September 19, 2023, the former CEO filed for binding arbitration under the employment rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). An arbitrator was appointed on November 29, 2023. On March 25, 2024, the arbitrator denied the former CEO’s motion for compensation during the dispute and payment of his legal fees, preserving those matters for the arbitration hearing. An arbitration hearing was conducted from March 31 through April 9, 2025. Following the arbitration hearing, the parties filed post-hearing briefs on May 16, response briefs on June 13 and conducted oral arguments on June 30, 2025. Unless the arbitrator requests additional time, and the parties' consent to such request, the arbitrator is expected to deliver a ruling on the claims no than August 14, 2025. The Company continue to contest vigorously the claims under the CIC Agreement and believes that the Company has strong arguments that the former CEO’s claims lack merit. If the arbitrator rules in the Company's favor, the Company may still need to pay the former CEO’s reasonable legal fees, interest, and compensation during the dispute. If instead the arbitrator rules for the former CEO, the Company could be liable for up to approximately $
14,100
, based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on June 26, 2023, for accelerated equity vesting, severance, and other benefits under the CIC Agreement, plus interest, legal fees and expenses and compensation during dispute, which could include the former CEO's base salary and other amounts based on the compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which he participated. The Company categorically denies any wrongdoing or liability under the CIC Agreement, but the outcome of potential 
65
Table of Contents
arbitration is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the Company will incur a liability in this matter, and the Company estimates the potential range of exposure from $
0
 to $
14,100
, plus costs and attorneys’ fees and compensation to the former CEO during the dispute.
On December 13, 2023, a securities class action complaint was filed against the Company, Mark Aslett, and Michael Ruppert in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint asserted Section 10(b) and 20(a) securities fraud claims on behalf of a purported class of purchasers and sellers of the Company's stock from December 7, 2020, through June 23, 2023. The complaint alleged that the Company's public disclosures in SEC filings and on earnings calls were false and/or misleading. On February 27, 2024, the Court entered an order appointing Carpenters Pension Trust Fund for Northern California as lead plaintiff. On April 18, 2024, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint including William Ballhaus and David Farnsworth as additional defendants and amended the class period to February 3, 2021 through February 6, 2024. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on May 24, 2024, and after the plaintiffs’ filed their opposition motion and the Company filed its reply to their opposition, a hearing on the motion was conducted by the Court on July 24, 2024. On July 24, 2024, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice and permitted the plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed for leave to amend their complaint on August 23, 2024, the Company filed its opposition motion on September 6th, the plaintiffs filed their response brief on September 17, 2024, and the Company filed its reply on September 30, 2024. On February 20, 2025, the Court issued an order that dismissed claims relating to 14 of 17 challenged statements and that allowed the remaining three challenged statements to proceed. The Court also dismissed Messrs. Ruppert and Farnsworth from the lawsuit. The parties are in the discovery process. Subject to the terms of our by-laws and applicable Massachusetts law, Mr. Aslett and Mr. Ballhaus are indemnified by the Company for the federal securities class action.
On October 11, 2024, the Company received a shareholder derivative demand on behalf of Robert Sawyer alleging substantially the same claims as those covered in the federal securities class action. On November 14, 2024, the Company entered into a tolling agreement on this derivative demand. On February 28, 2025, the Company received a derivative demand on behalf of James Jones alleging substantially the same claims as those covered in the federal securities class action and the Robert Sawyer derivative demand. On May 20, 2025, the Board of Directors formed a Special Investigation Committee of independent directors to investigate the subject matters of the demand letters. On June 6, 2025, James Jones, on behalf of nominal defendant Mercury Systems, Inc., filed a derivative complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court in Essex County against Mark Aslett, Michael Ruppert, William Ballhaus, David Farnsworth, Orlando Carvalho, Lisa Disbrow, Barry Nearhos, Howard Lance, Debora Plunkett, Gerard DeMuro, Scott Ostfeld, Roger Krone, William O’Brien, Vincent Vitto, James Bass, Michael Daniels, and Mary Louise Krakauer, all current or former Mercury officers or directors. This derivative action has been stayed while the Special Investigation Committee conducts its investigation. On July 17, 2025, the Company received a derivative demand on behalf of Pauline McKinnon alleging substantially the same claims as those covered in the federal securities class action and the James Jones and Robert Sawyer derivative demands. The Company believes the claims in the federal securities class action, derivative demands, and derivative action are without merit and intend to defend itself vigorously. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, the Company will have for this matter.
On January 31, 2024, a former employee at the Company's Torrance, California location, filed a wage and hour class action lawsuit in California state court in Los Angeles County, along with a companion Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) lawsuit, to act in a representative capacity for other Mercury Mission Systems, LLC employees in California, alleging a range of violations of California wage and hour regulations. On October 1, 2024, a second former employee at our Torrance location filed a PAGA notice to act in a representative capacity on allegations of a range of violations of California wage and hour regulations. On December 21, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle to settle these wage and hour class action claims for $450, which settlement in principle is subject to a final settlement agreement and review and approval by the court.

NDEMNIFICATION
 O
BLIGATIONS
The Company's standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited.

The Company may elect from time to time to purchase and subsequently retire shares of common stock in order to settle an individual employees’ tax liability associated with vesting of a restricted stock award or exercise of stock options.

Debt
Revolving Credit Facilities
On February 28, 2022, the Company amended the Revolver to increase and extend the borrowing capacity to a $
1,100,000
, 
5-year
 revolving credit line, with the maturity extended to February 28, 2027. As of June 27, 2025, the Company's outstanding balance of unamortized deferred financing costs was $
3,523
, which is being amortized to Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss over the term of the Revolver and includes the costs incurred in conjunction with the November 2023 amendment to the Revolver.
On November 7, 2023, due to the uncertainty surrounding a government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution and the potential impact on the second quarter and fiscal 2024 results, the Company proactively executed Amendment No. 5 to the Revolver, as amended to date, with a syndicate of commercial banks and Bank of America, N.A acting as the administrative agent allowing for a temporary increase in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant requirement from 
4.50
 to 
5.25
 for the second quarter ended December 29, 2023. In conjunction with Amendment No. 5 to the Revolver, the Company incurred $
1,931
 of new deferred financing costs that will be amortized over the remaining term of the Revolver. Refer to exhibit 10.7.5 included herein. 
On August 13, 2024, the Company executed Amendment No. 6 to the Revolver, decreasing the permanent borrowing capacity to $
900,000
, with a temporary reduction in credit availability to $
750,000

2,249
 of new deferred financing costs that will be amortized over the remaining term of the Revolver. As part of the amendment, the Company wrote off $
714

This write-off is included in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Refer to exhibit 10.7.6 on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC on August 13, 2024.
Maturity
The Revolver has a 
5-year
 maturity and will mature on February 28, 2027.
Interest Rates and Fees
Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest, at the Company’s option, at floating rates tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or the prime rate plus an applicable percentage in the case of dollar denominated loans or, in the case of certain other currencies, such alternative floating rates as agreed. The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans has initially been set at SOFR plus 
1.25
% and in future fiscal quarters will be established pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio.
In addition to interest on the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of any borrowings, the Company will also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized commitments under the Revolver, which fee has initially been set at 
0.20
% per annum and in future fiscal quarters will be established pursuant to a pricing grid based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The Company will also pay customary letter of credit and agency fees.
Covenants and Events of Default
The Revolver provides for customary negative covenants, including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on the incurrence of debt or guarantees, the creation of liens, the making of certain investments, loans and acquisitions, mergers and dissolutions, the sale of assets including capital stock of subsidiaries, the payment of dividends, the repayment or amending of junior debt, altering the business conducted, engaging in transactions with affiliates and entering into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. The Revolver also requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, including a quarterly minimum consolidated cash interest charge ratio test and a quarterly maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio test.
The Revolver also provides for customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, the failure to make required payments of principal and interest, certain insolvency events and an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Revolver will be entitled to take 
67

various actions, including the termination of unutilized commitments, the acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Revolver and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
Guarantees and Security
The Company’s obligations under the Revolver are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s material domestic wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).

Employee Benefit Plans
Pension Plan
The Company maintains a pension plan (the “Plan”) for its Swiss employees, which is administered by an independent pension fund. The Plan is mandated by Swiss law and meets the criteria for a defined benefit plan under ASC 715, 
Compensation—Retirement Benefits
 (“ASC 715”), since participants of the Plan are entitled to a defined rate of return on contributions made. The independent pension fund is a multi-employer plan with unrestricted joint liability for all participating companies for which the Plan’s overfunding or underfunding is allocated to each participating company based on an allocation key determined by the Plan. 
The Company recognizes a net asset or liability for the Plan equal to the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the Plan and the fair value of the Plan’s assets as required by ASC 715. The funded status may vary from year to year due to changes in the fair value of the Plan’s assets and variations on the underlying assumptions of the projected benefit obligation of the Plan.
In fiscal 2021, the independent pension fund changed the conversion rate for accumulated retirement savings leading to a Plan amendment. The Company’s results contain the effects of this change in conversion rates by the independent pension fund as prior service costs. These prior service costs are amortized from AOCI to net periodic benefit costs over approximately 
nine years
.
At June 27, 2025, the accumulated benefit obligation of the Plan equals the fair value of the Plan's assets. The Plan's funded status at June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024 was a net liability of $
5,282
 and $
5,005
, respectively, which is recorded in other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized net periodic benefit (gain) costs of $(
1,233
) and $
471
 associated with the Plan and a net loss of $
1,809
 and 
1,383
 in AOCI during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. Total employer contributions to the Plan were $
978
 during the year ended June 27, 2025, and the Company's total expected employer contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2026 are $
704
.

The fair value of Plan assets was $
12,440
 at June 27, 2025. The Plan is denominated in a foreign currency, the Swiss Franc, which can have an impact on the fair value of Plan assets. The Plan was not subject to material fluctuations during the years ended June 27, 2025 or June 28, 2024. The Plan’s assets are administered by an independent pension fund foundation (the “foundation”). As of June 27, 2025, the foundation has invested the assets of the Plan in various investments vehicles, including cash, real estate, equity securities, and bonds. The investments are measured at fair value using a mix of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.
401(k) Plan
The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for its U.S. employees. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company increased the rate of its matching contributions from 
3
% to 
6
% of participants' eligible annual compensation and changed the form of these contributions from cash to Company stock. The Company may also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at its discretion. The Company had $
3,068
 and $
2,901
 of capitalized stock-based 401(k) matching compensation expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. Stock-based 401(k) matching compensation cost is measured based on the value of the matching amount and is recognized as expense as incurred. Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions related to the 401(k) plan was $
14,900
, $
15,853
, and $
15,665
 during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025, June 28, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as of January 1, 2024, under which eligible employees may defer up to 50% of their base salaries and up to 100% of their annual incentive bonuses. The Company may also make employer contributions to participant accounts in its sole discretion, and currently matches participants’ deferrals under the plan of up to 6% of their eligible annual compensation in the form of deferred stock units (or at the Company’s election, a cash deferral credited to participants’ account balances). The Company’s matching obligations for participant deferrals made during each calendar year are subject to a financial performance condition for the Company's four fiscal quarters corresponding to such calendar year. In the case of the Company's matching obligations for participant deferrals made during calendar year 2024, the financial performance condition was fully satisfied, and the deferred stock units issued in respect of the Company's matching obligations vested accordingly. Participant deferrals under the plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. Assets held by the rabbi trust are classified as trading securities and are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recorded as adjustments to other income. All deferrals or employer contributions under the plan, and all earnings thereon, are fully vested as and when made or credited to plan participants.
As of June 27, 2025, the Company held assets under the rabbi trust of $
268
, was subject to liabilities for amounts payable under the plan to participants (including accrued employer matching contributions not yet credited to plan participants) of $
268
. Assets related to this plan are included in Other assets, and liabilities related to this plan are included in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, the Company recognized an immaterial value of compensation expense as a result of changes in the value of notional investments selected by plan 
70
participants for the investment of their plan account balances, with the same amount being recorded as other income attributable to changes in the market value of the assets held by the rabbi trust.

 shares rolled into the 2018 Plan that were available for future grant under the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2005 Plan”). The 2018 Plan replaced the 2005 Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock awards to employees and non-employees. Stock options must be granted with an exercise price of not less than 
100
% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and the options generally have a term of 
seven years
. There were 
3,810

As part of the Company's ongoing annual equity grant program for employees, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock awards to certain executives and employees pursuant to the 2018 Plan. Performance awards vest based on the requisite service period subject to the achievement of specific financial performance targets. Based on the performance targets, some of these awards require graded vesting which results in more rapid expense recognition compared to traditional time-based vesting over the same vesting period. The Company monitors the probability of achieving the performance targets on a quarterly basis and may adjust periodic stock compensation expense accordingly based on its determination of the likelihood for reaching targets. The performance targets generally include the achievement of financial performance goals, either on an absolute basis or relative to a peer group of companies. Payouts under performance-based restricted stock awards may also be subject to modification based on Mercury's total shareholder return relative to the component companies within the Spade Defensive Index.

The expected volatility of options granted has been determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equal to the expected term of the option. The expected term of options has been determined using the average of the contractual term and the weighted average vesting term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero-coupon U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
. The Company applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate based on historical averages in determining the expense recorded in each period.

Operating Segment, Geographic Information and Significant Customers
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise evaluated regularly by the Company's chief executive officer who acts as its CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company evaluated its internal organization under FASB ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
 ("ASC 280") to determine whether there has been a change to its conclusion of a single operating and reportable segment. The Company concluded there has been no changes given the CODM continues to evaluate and manage the Company on the basis of one operating and reportable segment. The Company utilized the management approach for determining its operating segment in accordance with ASC 280.

(1) Identifiable long-lived assets exclude ROU assets, goodwill and intangible assets.
In recent years, the Company completed a series of acquisitions that changed its technological capabilities, applications and end markets. As these acquisitions and changes occurred, the Company's proportion of revenue derived from the sale of components in different technological areas, and modules, sub-assemblies and integrated solutions which combine technologies into more complex diverse products has shifted. The following tables present revenue consistent with the Company's strategy of expanding its technological capabilities and program content. As additional information related to the Company’s products by end user, application, product grouping and/or platform is attained, the categorization of these products can vary over time. When this occurs, the Company reclassifies revenue by end user, application, product grouping and/or platform for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the underlying trends of results within each revenue category.
The following table presents the Company's net revenue by end market for the periods presented:

(1) Components represent the basic building blocks of an electronic system. They generally perform a single function such as switching, storing or converting electronic signals. Some examples include power amplifiers and limiters, switches, oscillators, filters, equalizers, digital and analog converters, chips, MMICs (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) and memory and storage devices.
(2) Modules and sub-assemblies combine multiple components to serve a range of complex functions, including processing, networking and graphics display. Typically delivered as computer boards or other packaging, modules and sub-assemblies are usually designed using open standards to provide interoperability when integrated in a subsystem. Examples of modules and sub-assemblies include embedded processing boards, switched fabrics and boards for high-speed input/output, digital receivers, graphics and video, along with multi-chip modules. Additional examples include integrated radio frequency and microwave multi-function assemblies and radio frequency tuners and transceivers.
(3) Integrated solutions bring components, modules and/or sub-assemblies into one system, enabled with software. Subsystems are typically, but not always, integrated within an open standards-based chassis and often feature interconnect technologies to enable communication between disparate systems. Spares and replacement modules and sub-assemblies are provided for use with subsystems sold by the Company. The Company’s subsystems are deployed in sensor processing, aviation and mission computing and C4I applications.

Q.
Derivatives
The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to mitigate interest rate exposure with respect to its financing arrangements. On September 7, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate Swap (the “Initial Swap”) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) for a notional amount of $
300,000
 in order to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of the total $
511,500
 existing borrowings on the Revolver at a rate of 
3.25
%. The Initial Swap agreement was designated and qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge. The Initial Swap was scheduled to mature on February 28, 2027, coterminous with the maturity of the Revolver. 
On September 29, 2022, the Company terminated the Initial Swap. At the time of termination, the fair value of the Initial Swap was an asset of $
5,995
. The Company received the cash settlement of $
5,995
 and these proceeds are classified within Operating Activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
Following the termination of the Initial Swap, the Company entered into the September 2022 Swap agreement with JPMorgan on September 29, 2022. The September 2022 Swap fixed $
300,000
 of total $
511,500
 existing borrowings on the Revolver at the time of the Swap at a rate of 
3.79
%. The Swap agreement was designated and qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge. The Swap was scheduled to mature on February 28, 2027, coterminous with the maturity of the Revolver.
On September 28, 2023, the Company terminated the September 2022 Swap. At the time of termination, the fair value of the Swap was an asset of $
7,403
. The Company received the cash settlement of $
7,403
 and these proceeds are classified within Operating Activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
Following the termination of the September 2022 Swap, the Company entered into the September 2023 Swap agreement on September 28, 2023 with JPMorgan for a notional amount of $
300,000
 in order to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of the total $
576,500
 existing borrowings on Company's Revolver at the time of the Swap at 
4.66
%. The September 2023 Swap agreement was designated and qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge. The September 2023 Swap matures on February 28, 2027, coterminous with the maturity of the Revolver.
As of June 27, 2025, the fair value of the September 2023 Swap was a liability of $
5,391
 and is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During fiscal year 2025, the Company amortized $
3,524
 of the gains associated with the interest swaps terminated on September 29, 2022 and September 28, 2023, which is included within Accumulated other comprehensive income.
The market risk associated with the Company’s derivative instrument is the result of interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying arrangement. The counterparty to the Swap is JPMorgan. Based on the credit ratings of the Company’s counterparty as of June 27, 2025, nonperformance is not perceived to be a material risk. Furthermore, none of the Company’s derivatives are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on the Company’s credit ratings from any credit rating agency. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of the counterparty to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparty. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant.
