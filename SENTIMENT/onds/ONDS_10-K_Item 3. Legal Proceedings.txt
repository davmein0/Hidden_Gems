Overview

Ondas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas
Holdings,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and
automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc., a Texas corporation (“Ondas Networks”), Ondas Autonomous
Systems Inc., a Nevada corporation (“OAS”), which wholly-owns Airobotics Ltd., an Israeli company (“Airobotics”),
and American Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“American Robotics”).

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics and American Robotics. Ondas
Networks and OAS together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets with
improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks
and OAS as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment. See Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments.

Ondas Networks Segment

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the
Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT
applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time
connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required
in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drone operations, oil and gas, and public safety,
homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and
ensure a high degree of safety and security. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16
standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we
continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets.

We design, develop, manufacture,
sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, private, wide-area broadband networks.
Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. By upgrading their
legacy systems, customers benefit from significant increases in data throughput which enables new applications. We have targeted the North
American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications
systems utilizing dated narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited
data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. The freight rail operators
through the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), its advisory subsidiary MxV Rail, as well as the American Railway Engineering
and Maintenance Association (“AREMA”), have adopted the IEEE 802.16 standard for future private wireless networks.

Our software-based FullMAX
platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet
Protocol-based communications to provide security, more reliability and significant data throughput for our mission-critical infrastructure
customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy
serial and analog based protocols no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent
networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications
over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial
networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth.

Industry Partnerships

Ondas Networks continues to
develop partnerships in the rail space to develop and market wireless communications products and services based on Ondas Networks’
technology. Our partnership with Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”) is geared to market our FullMAX-based networking technology
and services and to jointly develop certain wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’
Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform. We are working with other industry partners
to commercialize our platform technologies for specific use cases and to drive broad industry adoption of dot16 applications.

OAS Segment

Our OAS business unit develops
and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises.
Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially
available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing
and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.

Our unique, fully autonomous
platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business
focuses on end-user entities in defense, homeland security, public safety, smart city, airport authorities, and other governmental entities
together with commercial operators of critical industrial and technology facilities such as oil & gas, seaports, mining, and heavy
construction as well as for data centers and semiconductor fabs. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-time aerial data
capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and
field area operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful
implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance,
handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.

42

Our portfolio companies, American
Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace
business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing
all the challenges arising along these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and
ongoing support.

OAS and its portfolio companies
have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification
(TC) from the FAA for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this
distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations
over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness
and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of
operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight
(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned
with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge
drone tech and capabilities.

War in Israel

On October 7, 2023, the State
of Israel, where Airobotics’ main offices and facilities are located, suffered a surprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza
Strip, which led to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring a state of war in Israel. This military operation and related
activities are on-going as of the date of this filing.

The Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related
activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to support future operations, including the
Company’s ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™ and to ship them outside of Israel.
Although there have been disruptions in our business and operations, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially
adverse effects on its business or operations. The Company does not believe the disruptions in its business and operations will have an
enduring impact on its business and operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any future escalation or change could result
in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company’s Israeli office to support the Company’s activities. The Company
does not have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.

The principal use of cash
in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, was to fund the Company’s current expenses primarily related to operating
activities necessary to allow us to service and support customers.

The decrease in cash flows
used in operating activities of $549,896 was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of approximately $6,837,000, of which approximately
$1,409,000 relates to non-cash and credits, including depreciation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of
intangibles assets and right of use asset, stock-based compensation, and change in fair value of government grant liability; approximately
$4,011,000 relates to non-cash impairment of long-term assets; offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a cash
outflow of approximately $867,000.

47

The increase in cash flows
used in investing activities of $2,267,949, relates to an increase of approximately $1,452,000 in payments made for purchase of equipment,
software intangibles and patent costs, and a decrease of approximately $47,000 from net of proceeds from sale of equipment, combined with
a decrease of approximately $1,049,000 for cash acquired with the Airobotics acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2023, partially
offset by the decrease of approximately $280,000 for cash paid for asset acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in cash provided
by financing activities of $31,448,470 was due to an increase in net proceeds from convertible debt of approximately $27,687,000, increase
in net proceeds from notes payable of approximately $1,422,000, increase in proceeds from exercise of options and warrants of approximately
$18,000, increase in net proceeds of approximately $110,000 from government grants, and approximately $7,304,000 in net proceeds from
the sale of the Company’s Common Stock and warrants. Combined with a decrease of approximately $4,355,000 in cash payments on the
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes and a decrease of approximately $1,140,000 in cash payments for Airobotics related debt. This was partially
offset by a decrease in net proceeds of approximately $10,317,000 from the sale of noncontrolling interest in Ondas Networks and an increase
of approximately $271,000 in cash payments on the government grants liability.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. On December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $236,368,000. On December 31, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $18,057,000
net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $1,682,000 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $38,747,000,
net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $5,825,000. On December 31, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash of approximately
$29,999,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $3,056,000. We had approximately $33,470,000 of net cash flows used in operations
for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In 2024, we raised approximately
$36,997,000 of net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Holdings, Ondas Networks, and OAS; approximately $1,422,000 of
net proceeds from issuance of secured notes in Ondas Networks; approximately $7,304,000 of net proceeds from issuing common stock in Ondas
Holdings, warrants in Ondas Holdings, and warrants in OAS; and approximately $4,375,000 in net proceeds from issuing additional redeemable
preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings.

In January 2025, we raised
approximately $931,000 in gross proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Networks.

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K from the cash on hand as of December 31, 2024, proceeds
from the 2025 financing activity discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for
purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt
offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the funding
plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated. As a result, there is substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from March 12, 2025, the date the Consolidated Financial
Statements were available to be issued.

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We also
will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research
and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and
cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional
notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable
terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to
fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or
limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations. 

In addition, the global economy
has recently seen a rise in tariffs and threats of tariffs. While tariffs have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition
or results of operations to date, new tariffs could increase the costs of raw materials and other goods, both for us and our suppliers,
which could impact our business, particularly as we begin to scale our manufacturing operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

●
requires
assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and

●
changes
in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
condition.

We base our estimates and
judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry,
information provided by our customers and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most
critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments
in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense, income taxes, complex derivative financial instruments
and impairment of long-lived assets including intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 

Stock-Based Compensation
Expense
. We calculate stock-based compensation expense for option awards (“Stock-based Award(s)”) based on the estimated
grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”) and recognize the
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. The Black-Scholes Model requires the
use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting
period in determining the fair value of Stock-based Awards. The expected term is based on the “simplified method.” Under this
method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term of the option award. As the
Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has identified several public entities of similar complexities
and industry and calculates historical volatility based on the volatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions used
to calculate share-based compensation expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which
are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the
amount of expense recorded in a given period.

We recognize restricted stock
unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. Compensation associated with shares of Common Stock
issued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized over the expected service period beginning on the measurement
date, which is generally the time the Company and the service provider enter into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares
in exchange for the services to be provided.

Income Taxes
. As part
of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes.
A current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more-likely-than-not to be realized. Changes in
valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are
modified through translation, in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted. Where
a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets, any future change will be credited
or charged to income tax expense. See Note 13 – Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion
related to Tax Reform.

49

The determination of our provision
for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite
of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may
be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect
to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject
to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events
and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could
be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.

Complex Derivative Financial
Instruments
. From time to time, we sell common stock, and we issue convertible debt, both with common stock purchase warrants, which
may include terms requiring conversion price or exercise price adjustments based on subsequent issuance of securities at prices lower
than those in the agreements of such securities. In these situations, the instruments may be accounted for as liabilities and recorded
at fair value each reporting period. Due to the complexity of the agreement, we use an outside expert to assist in providing the mark
to market fair valuation of the liabilities over the reporting periods in which the original agreement was in effect. It was determined
that a Binomial Lattice option pricing model using a Monte Carlo simulation would provide the most accuracy given all the potential variables
encompassing a future dilutive event. This model incorporated transaction assumptions such as our stock price, contractual terms, maturity,
risk free rates, as well as estimates about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior. Although we believe our estimates and
assumptions used to calculate the fair valuation liabilities and related expense were reasonable, these assumptions involved complex judgments
about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could
significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets
. Carrying values of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, we determine
whether an impairment loss should be recognized by testing the applicable asset or asset group’s carrying value for recoverability.
This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the eventual disposal
of the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity
and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, then
a loss is recorded for the difference between the assets’ fair value and respective carrying value. The fair value of the assets
is determined using an “income approach” based upon a forecast of all the expected discounted future net cash flows associated
with the subject assets. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions include: market size and growth, market share, projected
selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are based upon historical experience, commercial relationships, market
conditions and available external information about future trends.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Ondas Holdings Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ondas
Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced
recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations and a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2024. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Excess and obsolete inventory reserve

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, management analyzes inventory for slow-moving and excess inventories on a recurring basis. Management establishes reserve
for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices. Inventory that is
in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand. Inventory
that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has inventories of $9.8 million, net of excess quantities and obsolescence reserves.

We identified the Ondas Networks reserve for excess quantities and
obsolete inventory as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to quantify the reserve.
Subjective auditor judgment was required in evaluating whether historical sales experience is indicative of future product demand, as
future product demand is based on the outcome of uncertain future events.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit

We performed the following audit procedures, among others, to test
management’s estimate of inventory:

–

We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's excess and obsolete
reserve policy, considering historical experience and the underlying assumptions and judgements used in the calculation.

–

Tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in
the reserve calculations.

–

Recomputed the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s reserve
calculations.

–

Tested the significant assumptions and the underlying inputs used by
the Company in its analysis including historical sales trends, expectations regarding future demand, product life cycles and other relevant
factors.

ONDAS HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Company

Ondas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas Holdings”, “Ondas”,
the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 22, 2014, under the
name of Zev Ventures Incorporated. On September 28, 2018, we acquired Ondas Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Delaware Networks”),
and changed our name to Ondas Holdings Inc. On August 5, 2021, we acquired American Robotics, Inc. (“American Robotics” or
“AR”), a Delaware corporation. On January 23, 2023, we acquired Airobotics, Ltd. (“Airobotics”), an Israeli-based
developer of autonomous drone systems. See Note 5 – Goodwill and Business Acquisition. On December 6, 2023, the Company formed Ondas
Autonomous Holdings Inc. (“OAH”), a Nevada corporation, as an intermediate holding company which now wholly-owns American
Robotics and Airobotics. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada,
amending Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc.’s name to Ondas Autonomous Systems Inc. (“OAS”). On August 7, 2024, the Company
formed Ondas Networks Texas Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Texas Networks”). Pursuant
to a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 19, 2024, Delaware Networks merged with and into Texas Networks (the “Merger”)
with Texas Networks being the surviving entity resulting from the Merger and shall continuing to exist and being governed by the laws
of the State of Texas under the corporate name “Ondas Networks Inc.” (“Ondas Networks”).

As a result, Ondas Networks,
OAS, American Robotics and Airobotics became our subsidiaries. Ondas’ corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts.
Ondas Networks has offices and facilities in Sunnyvale, California, American Robotics’ offices and facilities are located in Sparks,
Maryland, and Airobotics’ offices and facilities are located in Petah Tikva, Israel.

Business Activity

Ondas is a leading provider
of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks, OAS, Airobotics, and American Robotics.
Ondas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics
and American Robotics. Ondas Networks and OAS together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure
and government markets with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities.
We operate Ondas Networks and OAS as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment.

Ondas Networks 

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the
Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT
applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time
connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required
in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland
security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure
a high degree of safety and security.

F-

We design, develop, manufacture,
sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband
networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have
targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate
legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy
wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems.
Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading
worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications
solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as
it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption
of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.

Our software-based FullMAX
platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet
Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe
industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based
protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an
intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT
applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large
industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing”
capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing
and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent
MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.

Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS)

Our OAS business unit develops
and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises.
Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially
available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing
and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones. Airobotics
acquired the assets of Iron Drone on March 6, 2023.

Our unique, fully autonomous
platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business
focuses on end-user entities in defense, homeland security, public safety, smart city, airport authorities, and other governmental entities
together with commercial operators of critical industrial and technology facilities such as oil & gas, seaports, mining, and heavy
construction as well as for data centers and semiconductor fabs. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-time aerial data
capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and
field area operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful
implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance,
handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.

Our portfolio companies, American
Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace
business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies specialize in addressing all
the challenges arising along these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing
support.

OAS and its portfolio companies
have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification
(TC) from the FAA for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this
distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations
over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness
and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of
operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight
(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned
with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge
drone tech and capabilities.

Liquidity

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. On December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $
236,368,000
. On December 31, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $
18,057,000

net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $
1,682,000
 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $
38,747,000
,
net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $
5,825,000
. On December 31, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash of approximately
$
29,999,000
 and a working capital deficit of approximately $
3,056,000
. We had approximately $
33,470,000
 of net cash flows used in operations
for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In 2024, we raised approximately
$
36,997,000
 of net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Holdings, Ondas Networks, and OAS; approximately $
1,422,000
 of
net proceeds from issuance of secured notes in Ondas Networks; approximately $
7,304,000
 of net proceeds from issuing common stock in Ondas
Holdings, warrants in Ondas Holdings, and warrants in OAS; and approximately $
4,375,000
 in net proceeds from issuing additional redeemable
preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings.

In January 2025, we raised
approximately $
931,000
 in gross proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Networks.

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K from the cash on hand as of December 31, 2024, proceeds
from the 2025 financing activity discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for
purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt
offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the funding
plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated. As a result, there is substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from March 12, 2025, the date the Consolidated Financial
Statements were available to be issued.

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We also
will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research
and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and
cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional
notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable
terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to
fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or
limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries, Ondas Networks, OAS, American Robotics, and Airobotics. All inter-company
accounts and transactions between these entities have been eliminated in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The functional currency
of the Company and all of our subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.

Business Combinations

We utilize the purchase method
of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are
included in Ondas’ results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired, and liabilities
assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair
value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair
value on the acquisition date; these are recorded in either other accruals within current liabilities (for expected payments in less than
a year) or other non-current liabilities (for expected payments in greater than a year), both on our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent
changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition
date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original
acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of assets
acquired, and liabilities assumed in certain cases, may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a
period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other
business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets of an acquired business. The Company tests goodwill for impairment
on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist.
The Company evaluates qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment process.

Intangible assets represent
patents, licenses, software and allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business. The Company estimates
the fair value of its reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment
when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.

We amortize our intangible
assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis, over 
3
 years for software; 
10
 years for patents; 
3
-
10
 years for developed technology,

10
 years for licenses, trademarks, marketing-related assets and the FAA waiver; 
5
 years for customer relationships; and 
1
 year for non-compete
agreements.

Segment Information

Operating segments are defined
as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision
Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its
Chief Executive Officer. The Company determined it has two reportable segments: Ondas Networks and OAS as the CODM reviews financial information
for these two businesses separately. The Company has no inter-segment sales. 

Use of Estimates

The process of preparing financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such management estimates include those
relating to allocation of consideration for business combinations to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, revenue recognition,
inventory write-downs to reflect net realizable value, fair values of financial instruments and goodwill, assumptions used in the valuation
of stock-based awards and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-
11

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The Company considers all
highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024
and 2023, we had no cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes cash that is not readily available for use in the Company’s operating
activities. Restricted cash is attributable to minimum cash reserve requirements for Airobotics’ credit cards. The Company periodically
monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of the financial institutions with which it invests. Periodically, throughout the
year, and as of December 31, 2024, the Company has maintained balances in excess of federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2024,
the Company was approximately $
28,873,000
 in excess of federally insured limits.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated
at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for credit losses as well as net of any discounts or other forms of variable consideration.
We estimate allowance for credit losses by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates our customers may have an inability
to meet financial obligations, such as customer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended
period beyond contractual terms. We use assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record an allowance
to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These allowances are evaluated and adjusted as additional information
is received. We had no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $
992,571
 and $
1,050,000
 of expense related to credit
losses, respectively.

Inventory

Inventories, which consist
solely of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value,
net of reserves for obsolete inventory. We continually analyze our slow-moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected
sales volumes and anticipated selling prices, we established reserves. Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced
by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down
to net realizable value. On December 31, 2024 and 2023, such reserves were $
221,044
 and $
100,254
, respectively.

Inventory consists of the
following:

As of December 31, 2024, the Company reclassed
$
2,289,539
 of docking stations and drones, net into inventory, as OAS has shifted their focus from service revenue, selling a data subscription
service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems, to product revenue, primarily selling their Optimus
System™ and Iron Drone Raider™.

Property and Equipment

All additions, including improvements
to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and
equipment is principally recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives
typically are (i) 
3
 to 
7
 years for computer equipment, (ii) 
5
 years for vehicles and docking stations and drones, (iii) 
7
 - 
17
 years for
furniture and fixtures, (iv) 
5
 to 
7
 years for development equipment, and (v) 
3
 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term
 or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon the disposal
of property, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the amounts recorded therein for such items, and
any resulting gain or loss is recorded in operating expenses in the year of disposition. 

F-
12

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are evaluated whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Such indicators include
significant technological changes, adverse changes in market conditions and/or poor operating results. The carrying value of a long-lived
asset group is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment
loss recognized is the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. Fair market value
is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. The impairment
of long-lived assets was $
27,670
 and $
2,523,528
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information
on the asset impairment charges, see Note – 2 Summary of Significant Account Policies, 
Leases
, Note 4 – Property and
Equipment, and Note 6 – Intangibles Assets.

Research and Development

Costs for research and development
are expensed as incurred except for research and development equipment with alternative future use. Research and development expenses
consist primarily of salaries, salary-related expenses and costs of contractors and materials.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short- and long-term
debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate our fair value because of the short-term maturity
of such instruments. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles,
which are adjusted to fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
or the useful life has changed. Our estimate of the fair value of right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles are based on expected
future cash flows and actual results may differ from those estimates.

We have categorized our assets
and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level
1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Assets and liabilities recorded
in the balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs, as follows:

Level 1 
--

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2
 --

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3
 --

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Company had no Level 3
assets that were required to be valued at fair value as of December 31, 2024. The Company had Level 3 assets that are required to be valued
at fair value as of December 31, 2023, see Note – 2 Summary of Significant Account Policies, 
Leases
, and Note 4 – Property
and Equipment.

F-
13

The Company had Level 3 liabilities
that are required to be valued at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The fair value of the government grant liability is determined
as the sum of 
3
% royalty payments on forecasted future sales, discounted using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2024,
the Company made the following assumptions: (i) royalty payments will be made on future sales through 2027, and (ii) the effective interest
rate is a range of 
17
-
19
%. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the Level 3 government
grant liability measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs:

Deferred Offering Costs

The Company capitalizes certain
legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity financing as deferred offering
costs until such financing is consummated. After consummation of equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity
as a reduction of additional paid-in capital generated as a result of the offering. Should the planned equity financing be abandoned,
the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Government Grants

The government grant liability
was assumed through the acquisition of Airobotics and asset purchase of Iron Drone. Airobotics and Iron Drone received government grants
from the Israel Innovation Authority (formerly: the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel, “the IIA”), and the grant funds
are repayable to the extent that future economic benefits are expected from the research project that will result in royalty-bearing sales.
A liability for grants received is first measured at fair value using a discount rate that reflects a market rate of interest. The difference
between the amount of the grant received and the fair value of the liability is accounted for as a government grant and recognized as
a reduction of research and development expenses.

At each reporting date, the
Company evaluates whether there is reasonable assurance that the liability recognized, in whole or in part, will not be repaid (since
the Company will not be required to pay royalties) based on the best estimate of future sales and using the original effective interest
method, which is 
17
-
19
%, and if so, the appropriate amount of the liability is derecognized through other income (expense). Amounts paid
as royalties are treated as a reduction of the liability. Royalty payments are due every nine months. There is no maturity date. The liability
exists until it is paid in full through royalty payments or the Company reports to the IIA there will be no further sales.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

In 2023 and 2024, Ondas Networks
Inc. entered into multiple agreements with a third party for the sale of redeemable preferred stock in Ondas Networks (see Note 11 –
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest). The preferred stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (
8
%) of the original
issue price and can be redeemed at the request of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary as follows:

(i)
In
respect of the 2023 investments, for the greater of two times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would
be due if the Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.

(ii)
In
respect of the 2024 investment, for the greater of one times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be
due if the Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.

The applicable accounting
guidance requires an equity instrument that is redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if it
is redeemable (a) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (b) at the option of the holder, or (c) upon the occurrence
of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. As a result, the Company recorded the noncontrolling interest as redeemable
noncontrolling interest and classified it in temporary equity within its consolidated balance sheet initially at its acquisition-date
estimated redemption value or fair value. In addition, the Company has elected to accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the
full redemption value as of the earliest redemption date by accruing dividends at 
8
% per annum and accreting the redemption value to two
and one times the initial investment, respectively, using the effective interest rate method.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only
if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized uncertain
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 
50
% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement
are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions as part of the income tax provision.

Stock-based Compensation

We calculate stock-based compensation
expense for option awards (“Stock-based Award(s)”) based on the estimated grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”) and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We
account for forfeitures as they occur. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the
stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period in determining the fair value of Stock-based Awards.
The expected term is based on the “simplified method”, due to the Company’s limited option exercise history. Under this
method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term of the option award. As the
Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has identified several public entities of similar size,
complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility based on the volatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions
used to calculate stock-based compensation expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events,
which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact
the amount of expense recorded in a given period.

We recognize restricted stock
unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. Compensation associated with shares of the Company’s
common stock, par value $
0.0001
 (the “Common Stock”), issued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized
over the expected service period beginning on the measurement date, which is generally the time the Company and the service provider enter
into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares in exchange for the services to be provided.

Shipping and Handling

We expense all shipping and
handling costs as incurred. These costs are included in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We expense advertising and
promotional costs as incurred. We recognized expense of $
76,008
 and $

Post-Retirement Benefits

We have one 401(k) Savings
Plan for US employees that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this 401(k)
Plan, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized
expense of $
256,910
 and $
328,357
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Airobotics’ post-employment
benefits are usually funded by deposits with insurance companies and are classified as defined deposit plans or defined benefit plans.
Airobotics’ has defined deposit plans, in accordance with Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law, 1963, according to which
Airobotics regularly makes its payments without having a legal or implied obligation to make additional payments even if the fund has
not accumulated sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits, in the current period and in previous periods. Deposits to a defined
benefit plan for severance pay or benefits, are recognized as an expense when deposited with the plan in parallel with receiving work
services from the employee. All of Airobotics’ employees in Israel are subject to Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law.
We recognized expense of $
823,870
 for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
624,758
 for the period of January 24, 2023 through December
31, 2023 related to these post-employment benefits.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from
product sales, services, and development arrangements. We determine revenue recognition in accordance with 
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to
determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the products or services it transfers to the customer.

Ondas has two business segments
that generate revenue: Ondas Networks and OAS. Ondas Networks is engaged in the development, marketing, and sale of wireless radio systems
for secure, wide area mission-critical, business-to-business networks. Ondas Networks generates revenue primarily from the sale of our
FullMAX System and the delivery of related services, along with non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) development projects with
certain customers. OAS generates revenue through the sales of their Optimus System™, the Iron Drone Raider™, and separately
priced support, maintenance and ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Optimus System™ and the Iron Drone Raider™.

Product Sales Revenue

Product revenue is generally
recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery
based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract, or upon installation when the combined performance obligation is not distinct within
the context of the contract.

Ondas Networks’ software
and hardware, and OAS’ Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™, are sold with a limited one-year basic warranty included
in the price. The limited one-year basic warranty is an assurance-type warranty, is not a separate performance obligation, and thus no
transaction price is allocated to it. The nature of tasks under the limited one-year basic warranty only provides for remedying defective
product(s) covered by the warranty.

F-
16

Service and Subscription Revenue

Service revenue is comprised
of separately priced support and maintenance sales, as well as ancillary services, directly related to product sales, including product
training, installation, and onsite support. Ancillary service revenues are recognized at the point in time when those services have been
provided to the customer and the performance obligation has been satisfied. The Company allocates the transaction price to the service
based on the stand-alone selling prices of these performance obligations which are stated in our contracts.

OAS also generates service
revenue by selling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems. The customer
pays for a monthly, annual, or multi-annual subscription service to remotely access the data collected by their autonomous systems. Data
subscription service revenue is recognized on straight line basis over the length of the customer subscription agreement. If a subscription
payment is received prior to installation and operation of their autonomous systems, it is held in deferred revenue and recognized after
operation commences over the length of the subscription service.

Development Revenue

Development revenue is comprised
primarily of non-recurring engineering service contracts to develop software and hardware applications for various customers. For Ondas
Networks, in 2024 and 2023, a significant portion of this revenue is generated from one parent customer whereby Ondas Networks is to develop
such applications to interoperate within the customers infrastructure. For these contracts, Ondas Networks and the customers work cooperatively,
whereby the customers’ involvement is to provide technical specifications for the product design, as well as to review and approve
the project progress at various markers based on predetermined milestones. The products developed are not able to be sold to any other
customer and are based in part upon existing Ondas Networks and customer technology. Development revenue is typically recognized over
time using a percentage of completion input method, whereby revenues are recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of satisfaction
of the performance obligation based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. The input method is utilized because
management considers it to be the best available measure of progress as the performance obligations are completed.

Revenue and cost estimates
are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of revenue and cost of revenue
are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current
and prior periods base in the performance completed to date.

Payment Terms

Ondas Networks’ payment
terms are Net 30 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. OAS’s payment terms vary and range
from Net 30 days to Net 60 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. Payment terms for the majority
of development related revenue carry milestone-related payment obligations which span the contract life. For milestone-based development
contracts, the customer reviews the completed milestone and once approved, makes payment pursuant to the applicable contract.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain
more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.
We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements
indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We allocate the total transaction price
to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar
circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price considering available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance
obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.

F-
17

Contract Modification

Contracts that are modified
to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements are assessed to determine if the modification either creates new or
changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, contract modifications are for products or services that are not distinct
from the existing contract due to the inability to use, consume or sell the products or services on their own to generate economic benefits
and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and
measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase
in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no modifications
to contract specifications.

Contract Assets and Liabilities

We recognize a receivable
or contract asset when we perform a service or transfer a good in advance of receiving consideration. A receivable is recorded when our
right to consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. A contract
asset is recorded when we have recognized revenue over time in accordance with meeting our performance obligation but are unable to invoice
the customer yet based on the contractual invoicing terms. The contract asset is reclassified to a receivable when the right to consideration
becomes unconditional. 
The table below details the activity in our contract assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Warranty Reserve

For our software and hardware
products, we provide a limited one-year assurance-type warranty and for our development service, we provide no warranties. The assurance-type
warranty covers defects in material and workmanship only. If a software or hardware component is determined to be defective after being
tested by the Company within the one-year, the Company will repair, replace or refund the price of the covered hardware and/or software
to the customer (not including any shipping, handling, delivery or installation charges). We estimate, based upon a review of historical
warranty claim experience, the costs that may be incurred under our warranties and record a liability in the amount of such estimate at
the time a product is sold. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates
of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the accrual
as claims data and historical experience warrants. The Company has assessed the costs of fulfilling its existing assurance-type warranties
and has determined that the estimated outstanding warranty obligation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are immaterial to the Company’s
financial statements.

Leases

Under Topic 842, operating
lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s
operating leases consisted of office spaces in Sunnyvale, CA, Marlborough, MA (the “American Robotics Lease”), Waltham, MA
(the “Waltham Lease”), and Petah Tikva, Israel (the “Airobotics Leases”).

On January 22, 2021, we entered
into a 24-month lease (effective April 1, 2021) with the owner and landlord (the “2021 Gibraltar Lease”), wherein the base
rate was $
45,000
 per month, with a security deposit in the amount of $
90,000
. On April 1, 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Gibraltar
Lease to extend the lease through September 30, 2023, wherein the base rate was $
65,676
 per month. On November 6, 2023, the Company amended
the 2021 Gibraltar Lease, as amended to further extend the lease through June 30, 2024, wherein the base rate was $
68,959
 per month. As
of July 1, 2024, the lease was terminated.

On August 7, 2023, Ondas Networks
entered into a 72-month lease agreement with the owner and landlord of office space in Sunnyvale, CA (the “Oakmead Lease”).
The Oakmead Lease commenced on October 1, 2023, and is an operating lease through September 30, 2029. Base rent is $
77,533
 per month,
increasing approximately 
3
% annually, with a security deposit due in the amount of $
269,428
. Base rent was abated during the first twelve
months of the term of the lease.

On August 5, 2021, the Company
acquired American Robotics and the American Robotics Lease, located in Marlborough, Massachusetts, wherein the base rate was $
15,469
 per
month, with an annual increase of 
3
% through January 2024, with a security deposit of $
24,166
. On August 19, 2021, American Robotics amended
the American Robotics Lease to reduce their space to approximately 
10,450
 square feet. The amendment reduced their annual base rent to
$
8,802
 per month, with an annual increase of 
3
% through January 31, 2024. On November 10, 2023, American Robotics amended the American
Robotics Lease, as amended to extend the existing lease term from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2026 and to relinquish a portion of
the leased outdoor space. The annual base rent was $
14,586
 per month starting February 1, 2024, with an annual increase of 
3.5
% through
January 2026. Effective September 30, 2024, the lease was terminated. The Company wrote off the remaining operating lease liability and
right of use asset and recognized a gain on lease termination of $
12,256
, which is included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On October 8, 2021, American
Robotics entered into an 86-month operating lease for space in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Waltham Lease commenced on March 1, 2022, and
is scheduled to terminate on April 30, 2029, wherein the base rate is $
39,375
 per month, increasing 
3
% annually, with a security deposit
due in the amount of $
104,040
.

On January 15, 2024, American
Robotics entered into an agreement to sublet their full leased space, leasehold improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in
Waltham, Massachusetts through April 30, 2029, the remaining lease term, for $
22,920
 per month from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025,
then $
41,250
 per month from May 1, 2025 through April 30, 2029. The sublease is an operating lease. This event indicated that the carrying
amount of the right of use asset, leasehold improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Asset
Group”) may not be recoverable. The Asset Group was tested for recoverability using the undiscounted cash flows from the sublease
and the Company found the Asset Group to be impaired. The Company determined the Level 3 fair value of the Asset Group using the sum of
future cash flows from the sublease, discounted to the present value using an assumed discount rate of 
10.5
%. Based on this valuation,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
1,383,536
 related to the right of use asset associated with this Asset Group, which is included
in General and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

On January 23, 2023, the Company
acquired Airobotics and the Airobotics Leases, which includes office space in Petah Tikva, Israel leased according to three different
lease agreements. These agreements are with respect to different sections of the entire leased area and were in effect through December
31, 2023, February 28, 2024, and November 30, 2024 wherein the base rate of the entire leased area was approximately $
20,500
 per month.
The expired leases are being accounted for on a month-to-month basis. 

On November 25, 2024, Airobotics
entered into a 24-month lease agreement with the owner and landlord of office space in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (the “Dubai Office
Lease”). The Dubai Office Lease commenced on December 1, 2024, and is an operating lease through December 2, 2026. Base rent for
the full lease term is $
272,262
, which was paid in full in December 2024.

We determine if an arrangement
is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. If we determine the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease,
at lease inception, we then determine whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in
recording a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right
to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the
lease term. For purposes of calculating operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, we use the non-cancellable lease term
plus options to extend that we are reasonably certain to take. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate based
on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. This rate is generally consistent
with the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our credit facilities, as this rate approximates our collateralized borrowing capabilities
over a similar term of the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term
(12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying assets. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for any
class of underlying asset.

Net Loss Per Common Share

Basic net loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding for each period (the denominator). Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting the dividends accumulated
for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from net income.

The computation of diluted
net loss per share is similar to the computation of basic net loss per share except that the numerator may have to adjust for any dividends
and income or loss associated with potentially dilutive securities that are assumed to have resulted in the issuance of shares of common
stock, and the denominator may have to adjust to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur
from shares of common stock issuable through stock options, warrants, restricted stock units, or convertible preferred stock. For purposes
of determining diluted earnings per common share, the treasury stock method is used for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock
units, and the if-converted method is used for convertible preferred stock as prescribed in ASC Topic 260. Because of the net loss for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact of including this in our computation of diluted net loss per share was anti-dilutive.

The following potentially
dilutive securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share
because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited number
of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) insurance limits. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was approximately $
28,873,000
 in excess of federally insured limits.

Credit is extended to customers
based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support
accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for credit losses.

Concentration of Customers

Because we have only recently
invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our
revenue. Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was composed of three customers accounting
for 
52
%, 
26
% and 
10
% of the Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Three customers accounted for

43
%, 
33
% and 
22
% of the Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing
10% or more of the total accounts receivable, were composed of two customers accounting for 
78
% and 
10
% of the Company’s accounts
receivable balance as of December 31, 2024, respectively. Three customers accounted for 
61
%, 
22
% and 
12
% of the Company’s accounts
receivable balance as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

As of January 1, 2024, the
Company adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), and the adoption had no impact on our accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements:

On September 30, 2022, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, which (1) clarifies existing guidance when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual
restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and (2) introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject
to contractual sale restrictions. The ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered
part of the unit of account of the equity security. Instead, the contractual sale restriction is a characteristic of the reporting entity.
Accordingly, an entity should not consider the contractual sale restriction when measuring the equity security’s fair value. Additionally,
the ASU clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. For public
business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The adoption of the pronouncement as of January 1, 2024 did not have a material impact on our accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which amends and
enhances the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. All disclosure requirements under this standard will also be required for
public entities with a single reportable segment. The new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, including interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of the pronouncement
as of January 1, 2024 resulted in additional disclosures in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 12 – Segment
Information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In October 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-06, which incorporates 14 of the 27 disclosures referred to by the SEC in their SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure
Update and Simplification, issued on August 17, 2018. The amendments in this ASU modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of
a variety of Topics in the Codification and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected Topics unless otherwise indicated.
The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively. For public business entities, the effective date for each amendment will be
the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early
adoption prohibited. The Company has evaluated the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-03, and it is not expected to have an impact
on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-08, “Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets”, which amends and enhances the disclosure requirements
for crypto assets. The new requirements will be effective for public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15,
2024. The Company has evaluated the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-08, and it is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires companies to provide disaggregated information
about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new requirements will
be effective for public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2024, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic
220-40)”. The amendments in ASU No. 2024-03 require disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about
certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity: 1. Disclose the amounts
of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion,
and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas-producing activities (DD&A) (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in
each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing
operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (a)–(e). 2. Include certain amounts that are already required to
be disclosed under U.S. GAAP in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements. 3. Disclose a qualitative description of
the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. 4. Disclose the total amount
of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. For all public business entities,
the amendments in ASU No. 2024-03 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this
standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2024, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments”.
The amendments in ASU No. 2024-04 clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments
should be accounted for as an induced conversion, applicable only to conversions that include the issuance of all equity securities issuable
pursuant to the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the debt at issuance, and make additional clarifications to assist stakeholders
in applying the guidance. For all entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities that have
adopted the amendments in ASU 2020-06. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

income (expense), net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As
of December 31, 2024, there was $
600,339
 of net property and equipment located in Israel.

In 2024, the Company reclassed
$
2,289,539
 of docking stations and drones, net into inventory, as OAS has shifted their focus from service revenue, selling a data subscription
service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems, to product revenue, primarily selling their Optimus
System™ and Iron Drone Raider™.

In December 2023, the Company
identified a change in circumstances in connection with the American Robotics sublease effective January 15, 2024, see Note – 2
Summary of Significant Account Policies, 
Leases, 
which indicated that the carrying amount of the right of use assets, leasehold
improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Asset Group”) may not be recoverable. As
a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
1,127,769
 related to the leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated
with the Asset Group, which is included in General and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2023. There was no indication of impairment for the year ended December 31, 2024.

NOTE 5 – GOODWILL AND BUSINESS ACQUISITION

We account for acquisitions
in accordance with FASB ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), and goodwill in accordance with ASC 350,
“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other” (“ASC 350”). The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
value of net assets acquired in a business combination is recorded as goodwill.

Airobotics Transaction

On
January 23, 2023, the Company, completed the acquisition of Airobotics, pursuant to the Agreement of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2022
(the “Original Airobotics Agreement”), and that certain Amendment to Agreement of Merger, dated November 13, 2022 (the “Airobotics
Amendment,” and together with the Original Airobotics Agreement, the “Airobotics Agreement”), by and among the Company,
Talos Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Airobotics.
In accordance with the terms of the Airobotics Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Airobotics (the “Merger”), with
Airobotics continuing as the surviving company of the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

At
the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each ordinary share of Airobotics, par value NIS 
0.01
 per share (the
“Airobotics Ordinary Shares”), issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by Airobotics or its subsidiaries (dormant
or otherwise) or by the Company or Merger Sub) was converted into, and exchanged for 
0.16806
 (the “Exchange Ratio”) fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Company, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings (“Merger
Consideration”). All fractional shares of the Company Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to a holder of Airobotics
Ordinary Shares as part of the Merger Consideration were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on the total number of shares of
the Company’s Common Stock issued to such holder of Airobotics Ordinary Shares. Holders of Airobotics Ordinary Shares received approximately

2.8
 million shares as consideration (excluding approximately 
1.7
 million shares underlying equity awards to be outstanding following the
Merger).

As
provided in the Airobotics Agreement, each outstanding option, warrant or other right, whether vested or unvested, to purchase Airobotics
Ordinary Shares (each, an “Airobotics Stock Option,” and collectively, the “Airobotics Stock Options”) issued
pursuant to the Airobotics Ltd. 2015 Israeli Share Option Plan and 2020 Incentive Equity Plan (the “Airobotics Plans”), was
assumed by Ondas and converted as of the Effective Time into an option, warrant or right, as applicable, to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock. Subject to the terms of the relevant Airobotics Stock Option, each Airobotics Stock Option is deemed to constitute an option,
warrant, or other right, as applicable, to purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Airobotics
Stock Option, a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole share) that the holder of such Airobotics Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder
exercised such option, warrant, or right to purchase full Airobotics Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time at a price
per share of Company Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the former per share exercise price for Airobotics
Ordinary Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Airobotics Stock Option, divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

As a result of the Merger,
the Company was dual listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). The
first trading day of the Company’s shares on TASE was January 26, 2023. On February 8, 2024, the Company took steps to voluntarily
delist the Company’s common stock from trading on TASE. The Company’s Common Stock continues to be listed for trading on Nasdaq,
and all of the shares traded on the TASE were transferred to Nasdaq where they can continue to be traded. See the Current Report on Form
8-K filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024 for further details.

Goodwill

$
2,144,938

The exercise price of the
warrants included in the purchase price consideration far exceeded the Company’s stock price at the date of acquisition, thus the
value of warrants was deemed de minimis.

The intangible assets acquired
include the developed technology, marketing-related assets, and customer relationships (see Note 6 – Intangible Assets). The final
purchase price allocation has changed from the preliminary allocation because of changes in the valuation of property and equipment and
intangibles. During the year ended December 31, 2023, measurement period adjustments were made of (1) $
68,483
 to reduce the estimated
fair value of property and equipment and increase goodwill, respectively, and (2) $
80,000
 to reduce the valuation of the customer relationships
intangible asset and increase goodwill, respectively.

Goodwill represents the assembled
workforce, acquired capabilities, and future economic benefits resulting from the acquisition. No portion of the goodwill is deductible
for tax purposes.

Our results for the year ended
December 31, 2023 include results from Airobotics between January 24, 2023 and December 31, 2023. The following unaudited pro forma information
presents the Company’s results of operations as if the acquisition of Airobotics had occurred on January 1, 2023. 
The pro forma
results do not purport to represent what the Company’s results of operations actually would have been if the transactions had occurred
on January 1, 2023 or what the Company’s operating results will be in future periods.

Goodwill Impairment

The Company has recognized
goodwill as part of the American Robotics acquisition in 2021 and Airobotics acquisition in 2023. The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are as follows:

Balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2024

$
27,751,921

Goodwill is tested for impairment
in the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process. In December 2024 and 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative analysis and
proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the OAS
reporting unit. Using a discounted cash flow model and market approach model with updated forecasts for revenue and cash flows, it was
determined that the fair value of the OAS reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

2022 Convertible Promissory Notes

On
October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain investors
pursuant to which we issued convertible notes (“2022 Convertible Promissory Notes”) in the principal amount of $
34.5
 million,
with a debt discount of $
4.5
 million and issuance costs of $
2.3
 million. The net amount of proceeds to us from the 2022 Convertible Promissory
Notes after deducting the placement agent’s fees and issuance costs were approximately $
27,703,000
. The Company intends to use the
net proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes for general corporate purposes, including funding capital, expenditures, or the
expansion of its business and providing working capital.

On
January 20, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement (“Amended SPA”). The Amended SPA amends
the notes as described below and was accounted for as a modification of the Purchase Agreement,

Pursuant
to the terms of the Amended SPA, on January 20, 2023, the Company exchanged the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, into 
3
% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2024 (the “2022 Convertible Exchange Notes”).

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, except that they (i)
are issued pursuant to the Base Indenture (as defined below) and the First Supplemental Indenture (as defined below); (ii) have a maturity
date of October 28, 2024; (iii) allow for the Acceleration of Installment Amounts (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes)
not to exceed eight (8) times the Installment Amount (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes) with respect to the Installment
Date (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes) related to the Current Acceleration (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange
Notes); and (iv) modify the Acceleration Conversion Price (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes).

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes were issued pursuant to the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”),
dated as of January 20, 2023, between the Company and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The
First Supplemental Indenture supplements the indenture entered into by and between the Company and the Trustee, dated as of January 20,
2023 (the “Base Indenture” and, together with the First Supplemental Indenture, the “Initial Indenture”). The
Initial Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the terms of the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes include
those set forth in the Initial Indenture and those made part of the Initial Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.

On July 21, 2023, the Company
entered into an agreement and waiver with the holder of the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes (the “Agreement and Waiver,” together
with the Purchase Agreement and Amended SPA, the “SPA”) that included (i) extending the Maturity Date to from October 28,
2024 to April 28, 2025; (ii) waive the last sentence of Section 8(e) of the Notes (such that last sentence of Section 8(e) of the Notes
shall have no further force and effect) (the “Acceleration Waiver”); (iii) reduce the Conversion Price of the 2022 Convertible
Exchange Notes to the lower of (A) the Conversion Price then in effect and (B) the greater of (x) the Floor Price (as defined in the Notes)
then in effect and (y) 
125
% of the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Common Stock during the five (5) consecutive
Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date; provided, that, in addition, during the
period commencing on the effective date through and including September 30, 2023, the conversion price of the Notes, solely with respect
to voluntary conversions of such aggregate Conversion Amount of the Notes not in excess of such aggregate Current Installment Amounts
of such applicable period (or otherwise eligible to be converted in one or more Accelerations during such applicable period), shall be
further lowered to the Installment Conversion Price (as defined in the Existing Note) in effect for the Installment Date (as defined in
the Existing Note) of the Existing Note of July 3, 2023; (iv) to extend the Additional Closing Expiration Date to April 28, 2026; and
(v) increase the aggregate principal amount of Notes issuable in one or more Additional Closings to $
46,000,000
. This agreement was
accounted for as a modification.

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes bear interest at the rate of 
3
% per annum. The 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes are payable in monthly
installments beginning on November 1, 2022, through the maturity date of 
April 28, 2025
 (each such date, an “Installment Date”).
On each Installment Date, we will make monthly payments by converting the applicable “Installment Amount” (as defined below)

a minimum $
1.50

500,000
 minimum daily volume, and maintaining continued Nasdaq listing requirements among other conditions.
If these conditions are not met, installments can be requested in cash. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we issued 
21,284,556

and 
14,028,022
 common shares as a result of Installment Conversion, respectively. At each Installment Date the note holder may defer some
or all of the amount due until the subsequent Installment Date. In between Installment Dates, the note holder also has the option to accelerate
certain portions of principal due. At each Installment Date the price used to exchange outstanding notes into Common Stock is based on
the lower of (A) 
92
% of the lowest VWAP of the respective previous five trading days; and (B) the Floor Price ($
0.32
 as of December 31,
2024). The maximum conversion price is $
1.50
 per share.

The
“Installment Amount” will equal:

(i)
for
all Installment Dates other than the maturity date, the lesser of (x) the Holder Pro Rata Amount of $
1,437,500
 and (y) the principal
amount then outstanding under the Note; and

(ii)
on
the maturity date, the principal amount then outstanding under the Note.

Each
month, the note holders may accelerate a portion of the note due up to eight times the minimum Installment Amount of $
1,437,500
.

Warrants to Purchase Common Stock of the Company

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton
option model (the “Black-Scholes Model”) to determine the fair value of warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company.
The Black-Scholes Model is an acceptable model in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions
including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average term of the warrant.

The risk-free interest rate
assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term
of the warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the
expected life of the award. Our estimated volatility is an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were
publicly available over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. We used the historical volatility of peer entities due to the
lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price.

Networks entered into a second Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Networks Agreement”) for an investment of $
4.50
 million
in Ondas Networks (the “Networks Offering”). The Networks Agreement was entered into with the Networks Purchasers for the
sale of shares of preferred stock for a purchase of $
4.50
 million. The Networks Offering was consummated on February 26, 2024.

Pursuant to the Networks Agreement,
the Networks Purchasers acquired the following in the Networks Offering for gross proceeds to Ondas Networks of $
4.5
 million: (i) 
108,925

shares of preferred stock of Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $
41.3104
 per share (the “Per Share Price”),
convertible into shares of Common Stock, $
0.00001
 par value per share of Networks Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase 
3,015,000

shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at an exercise price of $
1.26
 per share, exercisable commencing ninety days following the
date of issuance through the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Holdings Warrants,” and together with the Networks
Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the “Networks Offering Securities”).

The Networks Series A-2 Preferred
Stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (
8
%) of the original issue price, of $
41.3104
 per share (the “Original
Issue Price”). Dividends shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the board of directors of Ondas Networks and Ondas Networks
shall be under no obligation to pay such dividends. Such dividends are payable in cash or additional shares of Networks Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, with such valuation based on the Original Issue Price. Each share of Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock is convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof,
into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Networks Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price
by the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion, which initially is set at $
41.3104
. In lieu of any fractional shares to which
the holder would otherwise be entitled, the number of shares of Networks Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Networks Series
A-2 Preferred Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. The Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock can be redeemed as the request
of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary for the greater of the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that
would be due if the Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock was converted into Networks Common Stock as described above.

Pursuant to the Networks Agreement,
the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers to register the resale of the Company’s Common Stock
underlying the Holdings Warrants pursuant to a registration statement to be filed no later 180 days following the closing of the Networks
Offering. Also, pursuant to the Networks Agreement, the Networks Purchasers became parties to those certain investors’ rights agreement,
right of first refusal agreement, and voting agreement, dated July 21, 2023.

Ondas Networks used the proceeds
from the sale of the Networks Offering Securities to immediately redeem an amount of shares of Networks Common Stock at the Per Share
Price held by the Company that was equivalent to the amount of proceeds raised in the sale of the Networks Offering Securities.

The issuance of the Networks
Offering Securities was exempt from registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of such Securities Act and
Regulation D promulgated thereunder based upon the representations of each of the Networks Purchasers that it was an “accredited
investor” (as defined under Rule 501 of Regulation D) and that it was purchasing such securities without a present view toward a
distribution of the securities. In addition, there was no general advertisement conducted in connection with the sale of the Networks
Offering Securities. See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 for further details.

The Company assessed the Networks
Series A-2 Preferred Stock in accordance with ASC 480 and determined that it should be recorded as temporary equity and not as a liability.
The initial valuation was assigned to the Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock and the Warrants based on relative fair values, with the
initial valuation of the noncontrolling interest being $
3,028,806
 and warrants being $
1,471,194
. It is being accreted using the effective
interest rate method over the five-year period to achieve the redemption value of $
4,500,000
 plus accrued dividends.

The Company recorded accrued
dividends of $
1,504,138
 and accretion of $
2,907,567
 for the year ended December 31, 2024 for the Networks Series A-1 and A-2 Preferred
Stock. The Company recorded accrued dividends of $
512,207
 and accretion of $
1,001,538
 for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Networks
Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

NOTE 12 – SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which
discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in making
decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. Segment operating
loss and segment loss before provision for income taxes are the measure of profit and loss used by the CODM to assess performance and
to decide how to allocate resources for each of the Company’s reportable segments. Segment operating loss and segment loss before
provision for income taxes are used to monitor actual results versus planned and prior period results for each segment based on their
respective profitability objectives and business models. Segment operating loss and segment loss before provision for income taxes are
also used to allocate human and capital resources among the reportable segments. The Company determined it has 
two
 reportable segments,
Ondas Networks and OAS, as the CODM reviews financial information for these two businesses separately. The Company has no inter-segment
sales.

In assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, including the net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), the Company assesses the available positive and negative
evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize its existing deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period when those temporary differences become
deductible. Based on its assessment, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as their
future utilization remains uncertain at this time.

Effective with the issuance
of redeemable preferred stock on July 21, 2023, Ondas Networks will not be a member of the Company consolidated US tax filing.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks, respectively,
had Federal NOLs of approximately $
1
 million and $
15
 million generated in 2007 to 2017 which will begin to expire in 2027 through 2037.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks, respectively, had Federal NOLs of $
73
 million
and $
59
 million, and of $
61
 million and $
51
 million, generated in 2018 through 2024 that have no expiration. As of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the Company and Ondas Networks, respectively, had State NOLs available to offset future taxable income of $
49
 million and $
93
 million,
and of $
43
 million and $
92
 million expiring from 2038 through 2044. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks,
respectively, had approximately $
0
 and $
752,000
, and $
0
 and $
752,000
, of Federal research and development credits available to offset
future tax liability expiring from 2038 through 2040. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $
134

million and $
127
 of Israeli NOL’s. The Company’s Federal income tax returns for the 2021 to 2023 tax years remain open to
examination by the IRS. Upon utilization of Federal NOLs in the future, the IRS may examine records from the year the loss occurred, even
if outside the three-year statute of limitations. The Company’s State tax returns also remain open to examination. The Company’s
Israeli income tax returns for the 2020 to 2023 tax years remain open to examination.

In accordance with Section
382 of the Internal Revenue code, the usage of the Company’s Federal Carryforwards could be limited in the event of a change in
ownership. As of December 31, 2021, the Company completed an analysis and determined that there were multiple ownership changes. Provided
sufficient taxable income is generated the annual base limitation plus increased limitation calculated pursuant to IRS Notice 2003-65
will allow the Company to utilize all existing losses within the carryover periods.

The Company applies the FASB’s
provisions for uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes the two-step process to determine the amount of recognized tax benefit. For
tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the largest
benefit that has a greater than 
50
% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2024, management
does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions that would require it to measure and reflect the potential lack
of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate its uncertain tax positions
in future periods to determine if measurement and recognition in its financial statements is necessary. The Company does not believe there
will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next year.

NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

We may be involved in legal
proceedings, claims and assessments arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes
are not predictable with assurance. There are no such loss contingencies that are included in the financial statements as of December
31, 2024.

On October 27, 2023, the Company
reached a settlement agreement for legal proceedings related to Ardenna in which the Company is entitled to receive $
600,000
 in reimbursements
for legal fees related to the proceedings. For the year ending December 31, 2024, the Company received $
550,000
 from the settlement agreement,
which is recorded in General and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On
June 6, 2024, Airobotics filed a Notice of Non-Payment with the Abu Dhabi Civil Courts in connection with a customer’s lack of payment
relating to a purchase order and breach of a settlement agreement in relation to such purchase order. A performance order was filed on
July 11, 2024, and rejected on July 17, 2024 by the Abu Dhabi Civil Courts. On July 30, 2024, Airobotics appealed the rejection of the
performance order. On August 28, 2024, the Abu Dhabi Civil Court of Appeals accepted the appeal and appointed an expert to review the
case. On October 9, 2024, the Abu Dhabi Civil Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Airobotics for the full amount of the initial purchase
order less amounts paid to date by the customer (without taking into consideration the terms of the settlement agreement breached by the
customer), which resulted in a total award of $
2,138,945
 plus interest and expenses. Airobotics will continue to pursue the collection
of such award. However, the Company cannot guarantee a successful outcome in collecting any of the funds owed to Airobotics.

NOTE 15 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the Company owed $
12,500

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management,
with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the period ended December 31, 2024 the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Our senior management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, senior management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may
from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.

Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of
this evaluation, our senior management has concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective
for the period ended December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs.

Insider Trading Policy

We have adopted an

Insider Trading Policy
 that governs the purchase, sale, and/or other disposition of our securities and is applicable to our directors,
officers, employees, and other covered persons. We believe our Insider Trading Policy is reasonably designed to promote compliance with
insider trading laws, rules, and regulations, and listing standards applicable to the Company. A copy of our insider trading policy is

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires directors, officers and greater than 10 percent beneficial owners of our common shares to file reports concerning their ownership
of, and transactions in, such common shares.

Based solely on our review
of these reports filed by the Company’s officers, directors and shareholders, and written representations from our executive officers
and directors that they filed such reports, we believe that our officers, directors, and shareholders complied with all filing requirements
under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on a timely basis during fiscal year 2024, except Mr. Curelaru untimely filed a Form 4 to report
the delivery of stock options.

We do not grant equity awards
in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information, and we do not time the release of material nonpublic information
based on equity award grant dates or for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. While we do not have a formal policy
with respect to the timing of awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, or similar option-like instruments to our NEOs, historically,
including during fiscal 2024, our Compensation Committee has not granted such awards. In certain circumstances, including the hiring or
promotion of an officer, the Compensation Committee may approve grants to be effective at other times.

Director Independence

A majority of our Board is
independent under the rules of Nasdaq. Our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of our directors and considered whether any
director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
As a result of this review, our Board has determined that Messrs. Cohen, Popolo and Seidl and Ms. Sood are “independent directors”
as defined under the rules of Nasdaq.
