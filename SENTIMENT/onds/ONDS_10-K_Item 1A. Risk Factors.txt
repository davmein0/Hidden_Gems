Risks Related to Our
Business and Industry

We have incurred
significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.

Since
our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $236 million and $198 million, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through
sales of our equity securities and debt financing.

We
expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we pursue our growth strategy, including expending substantial resources for
research, development and marketing. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain, and
we expect to continue incurring significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Any additional operating losses
may have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and the price of our common stock, and we cannot assure you that we will
ever be able to achieve profitability.

Even
if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability. Additionally, our costs may increase in future
periods and we may expend substantial financial and other resources on, among things, sales and marketing, the hiring of additional officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers, and general administration, which may include a significant increase in legal and
accounting expenses related to public company compliance, continued compliance and various regulations applicable to our business or arising
from the growth and maturity of our company. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could
impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain regulatory approvals, diversify our
product and service offerings or continue our operations, and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.

The adoption of
the IEEE 802.16t wireless broadband standard, an evolution of the IEEE 802.16s standard published in 2017, by customers in our target
critical infrastructure sectors is uncertain.

Ondas
Networks is currently developing technology compatible with the proposed wireless broadband standard known as IEEE 802.16t, which is an
evolution of the EEE 802.16s wireless broadband standard published in October 2017. We believe we are currently the only manufacturer
of IEEE 802.16s compliant wireless solutions and are likely to be the only manufacturer of IEEE 802.16t compliant wireless solutions when
that standard is formally ratified. The benefits of the standard to buyers of our equipment are greater when there exists a large, deep
market in terms of the number of customers. A large market benefits from the scale provided such that many vendors can compete on service,
price and quality of solution driving improved value for customers. If a large end market does not develop and customers do not see the
related benefits from the standard, we may not be able to grow our business. 

15

Our growth depends
in part on the success of our strategic partnerships with third parties such as Siemens Mobility, who are also customers, as well as on
our ability to establish a broad range of additional ecosystem partner and customer relationships with leading global industrial vendors
.

In
order to grow our business, we depend on partnerships with market leading technology and industrial companies such as Siemens Mobility,
who are also customers of Ondas Networks, in order to accelerate the adoption of our wireless technology. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining
our partnership and customer relationships with third parties, including Siemens Mobility, or if our partnerships do not provide us the
anticipated benefits, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may
suffer. In addition, adoption of our FullMAX wireless platform, Optimus System™, and Iron Drone Raider™ requires us to establish
additional ecosystem relationships with leading global industrial vendors and customers. Even if we are successful in executing these
partnerships and integrating with additional ecosystem vendors, we cannot assure you that these partnerships and relationships will result
in increased adoption of our technology or increased revenue.

If the commercial
UAS markets do not experience significant growth, if we cannot expand our customer base or if our products and services do not achieve
broad acceptance, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth.

We
cannot accurately predict the future growth rates or sizes of the markets for our products and services. Demand for our products and services
may not increase, or may decrease, either generally or in specific markets, for particular types of products and services or during particular
time periods. We believe the market for commercial UAS is nascent and the expansion of the market for our products and services in particular,
depends on a number of factors, including the following:

●
customer
satisfaction with these types of systems as solutions;

●
the
cost, performance and reliability of our products and products offered by our competitors;

●
customer
perceptions regarding the effectiveness and value of these types of systems;

●
obtaining
timely regulatory approvals for new customer deployments; and

●
marketing
efforts and publicity regarding these types of systems and services.

Even
if commercial UAS gain wide market acceptance, our products and services may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue
to gain market acceptance. If these types of systems generally, or our products and services specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance,
then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our revenue and results of operations would decline.

Negative customer perception regarding the
commercial UAS industry or the Company’s automated data solutions could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the Company’s
products and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company.

The Company believes the commercial
UAS industry is highly dependent upon customer perception regarding the safety, efficacy, and quality of the commercial UAS system deployed.
Customer perception of these products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation,
media attention, and other publicity. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation,
media attention, or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the UAS market. Future research reports, findings, regulatory
proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research
reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the Company’s products and the business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company. The dependence upon customer perceptions means that adverse scientific
research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit,
could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the demand for the Company’s products, and the business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows of the Company.

Failure to manage
our planned growth could place a significant strain on our resources.

Our
ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective plan for managing our future growth. We plan to increase the
scope of our operations. Current and future expansion efforts will be expensive and may significantly strain our managerial and other
resources and ability to manage working capital. To manage future growth effectively, we must manage expanded operations, integrate new
personnel and maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls. If we do not manage growth properly, it could harm
our business, financial condition or results of operations and make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations.

16

We
may be unsuccessful in achieving our organic growth strategies, which could limit our revenue growth or financial performance. Our ability
to generate organic growth will be affected by our ability to, among other things:

●
attract
new customers;

●
increase
the number of products purchased from customers;

●
maintain
profitable gross margins in the sale and maintenance of our products;

●
increase
the number of projects performed for existing customers;

●
achieve
the estimated revenue we announced from new customer contracts;

●
hire
and retain qualified employees;

●
expand
the range of our products and services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs;

●
expand
geographically, including internationally; and

●
address
the challenges presented by difficult and unpredictable global and regional economic or market conditions that may affect us or our customers.

Many
of the factors affecting our ability to generate organic growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies
for achieving internal growth will be attempted, realized or successful.

If we fail to retain
our existing customers or do not acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial
condition or results of operations may be harmed.

We
believe that our success is dependent on our ability to continue identifying and anticipating the needs of our customers, to retain our
existing customers and to add new customers. For example, our business plan is designed to penetrate large, critical infrastructure end
markets with our wireless and UAS driven data solutions and have expanded our dedicated sales resources and field personnel to broaden
our marketing and field support efforts into new industries and sectors. As a result, we have significantly increased customer engagement
in the transportation, security and UAS end markets with Ondas Networks and in the industrial, public safety and government markets with
OAS. We expect that our qualified customer pipeline will increase in other additional strategic end markets. However, as we become larger
through organic growth, the growth rates for customer engagement, project volume and average spend per customer may slow, even if we continue
to add customers on an absolute basis. In addition, the costs associated with customer retention may be substantially lower than costs
associated with the acquisition of new customers. Therefore, our failure to retain existing customers, even if such losses are offset
by an increase in revenue resulting from the acquisition of new customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

Additionally,
while a key part of our business strategy is to add customers in our existing geographic markets, we expect to expand our operations into
new geographic markets. In doing so, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully. Our expansion into new markets
may place us in unfamiliar and competitive environments and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources
and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. 

The Company faces uncertainty and adverse
changes in the economy.

Adverse changes in the economy
could negatively impact the Company’s business. Future economic distress may result in a decrease in demand for the Company’s
products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operating results and financial condition. Uncertainty and
adverse changes in the economy could also increase costs associated with developing and publishing products, increase the cost and decrease
the availability of sources of financing, and increase the Company’s exposure to material losses from bad debts, any of which could
have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and operating results of the Company. 

17

We have significant dependence on a small
number of customers, and the loss of such customers or a decrease in business conducted with such customers could materially harm our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Because
we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial
amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2024, three customers accounted for approximately $3,763,000, $1,902,000, and
$745,000 of our revenue or approximately 52%, 26%, and 10%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, three customers accounted
approximately $6,703,000, $5,127,000, and $3,395,000 of our revenue or approximately 43%, 33%, and 22%, respectively. The loss of the
2024 customers or a decrease in the business conducted with such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. 

Project performance
delays or difficulties, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations may result in additional costs to
us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.

Many
projects involve challenging engineering, construction or installation phases that may occur over extended time periods. We may encounter
difficulties as a result of delays or changes in designs, engineering information or materials provided by our customer or a third party,
delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customer’s failure to timely obtain
permits or meet other regulatory requirements including the securing of necessary FCC certifications or FAA approvals, weather-related
delays and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the
original delivery schedule. In addition, we contract with third-party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts. Any
delay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may be beyond our control and may
result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. Delays and additional costs
may be substantial, and, in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays. Delays may also disrupt the final
completion of our contracts as well as the corresponding recognition of revenues and expenses therefrom. In certain circumstances, we
guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels; failure
to meet any of our guarantees, schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties to us, including
obligations to pay liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors
could cause project cancellations, and we may be unable to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations
may impact our reputation, brand or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.

We do not control
certain aspects of the manufacturing process.

Our
reliance on a small number of third party contractors to complete manufacturing, certain research and development and deployment functions
reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs
and product supply including delays in transportation and delivery. Any manufacturing disruption by our usual contractors could impair
our ability to fulfill orders. We may be unable to manage our relationships with our usual contractors effectively as they may experience
delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, customer concerns about the contractor
or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders, or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery.
Similarly, to the extent that our usual contractors procure materials on our behalf, we may not benefit from any warranties received by
our usual contractors from the suppliers or otherwise have recourse against the original supplier of the materials or even the manufacturer.
In such circumstances, if the original supplier were to provide us or our usual contractors with faulty materials, we might not be able
to recover the costs of such materials or be compensated for any damages that arise as a result of the inclusion of the faulty components
in our products.

If
any of our contractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, then our ability
to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. In addition, the absence of qualified contractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship
could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. One or more of our usual contractors
may suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations,
or seek to terminate its relationship with us, or we may choose to change or add additional contractors for other reasons. Additionally,
we do not have long-term supply agreements with our usual contractors. As a result, we may be unable to renew or extend our agreement
on terms favorable to us, if at all. Although the manufacturing services required to manufacture and assemble our products may be readily
available from a number of established manufacturers, it may be risky, time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new manufacturer
relationships.

Any
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

18

Material delays
or defaults in customer payments could leave us unable to cover expenditures related to such customer’s projects, including the
payment of our subcontractors.

Because
of the nature of most of our contracts, we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from our customers in amounts sufficient
to cover expenditures as they are incurred. In certain cases, these expenditures include paying our contractors and purchasing parts.
If a customer defaults in making its payments on a project or projects to which we have devoted significant resources, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Certain of our
officers, employees, contractors and other service providers may work on projects that are inherently dangerous, and a failure to maintain
a safe worksite could result in significant losses.

Certain
of our project sites can place our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and others, including third
parties, in difficult or dangerous environments, and may involve difficult and hard to reach terrain, high elevation, or locations near
large or complex equipment, moving vehicles, high voltage or other safety hazards or dangerous processes. Safety is a primary focus of
our business and maintaining a good reputation for safety is critical to our business. Many of our customers require that we meet certain
safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety
and environmental procedures throughout our company. Maintaining such programs involves variable costs which may increase as governmental,
regulatory and industry safety standards evolve, and any increase in such costs may materially affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations. Further, if we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures or if our procedures fail, our officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers, including third parties, may suffer injuries. Failure to comply with such procedures,
client contracts or applicable regulations, or the occurrence of such injuries, could subject us to material losses and liability and
may adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future or to hire and retain talented officers, employees, contractors,
and other services providers, therefore materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our products are
subject to a lengthy sales cycle and our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and
resources in the design of their products.

Many
of our customers are conservative in their decision-making process. Sales cycles for new customers can vary from one to three years depending
on the complexity of the customer’s network, whether the customer is subject to state regulations, and annual budget cycles. During
this lengthy sales cycle, our potential customers may cancel or change their product plans. Customers may also discontinue products incorporating
our devices at any time or they may choose to replace our products with lower cost semiconductors. In addition, we are working with leading
customers in our target markets to define our future products. If customers cancel, reduce or delay product orders from us, or choose
not to release products that incorporate our devices after we have spent substantial time and resources developing products or assisting
customers with their product design, our revenue levels may be less than anticipated and our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected.

Our marketing efforts
depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing customers.

Our
marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current and past customers to provide positive references to new,
potential customers. A material portion of our current pipeline activity is concentrated in the transportation and aviation sectors as
well as in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Given our limited number of customers, the loss or dissatisfaction of any customer could substantially
harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market acceptance of our products and services, and impair our ability to attract new customers
and maintain existing customers. Further, as we expand into new vertical and geographic end markets, references from existing customers
could be similarly important. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

19

If our products
contain defects or otherwise fail to perform as expected, we could be liable for damages and incur unanticipated warranty claims, recall
and other related expenses, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose market share and, as a result, our financial condition or
results of operations could suffer.

Our
products rely on complex avionics, sensors, user-friendly interfaces and tightly integrated, electromechanical designs to accomplish their
missions. Our products may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, materials, manufacture, deployment
and/or use. If any of our products contain a defect, compatibility or interoperability issue or other error, we may have to devote significant
time and resources to find and correct the issue. Such efforts could divert the attention of our management team and other relevant personnel
from other important tasks. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could (i) be expensive; (ii) damage our reputation
and relationships with utilities and other third-party vendors; (iii) result in the loss of business to competitors; and (iv) result in
litigation against us. Costs associated with field replacement labor, hardware replacement, re-integration with third-party products,
handling charges, correcting defects, errors and bugs, or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results.

As
a manufacturer of UAV products, and with aircraft and aviation sector companies under increased scrutiny, claims could be brought against
us if use or misuse of one of our UAV products causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In addition, defects
in our products may lead to other potential life, health and property risks. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely
harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources.

The
existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products or the misuse of our products could also lead to product liability claims
or lawsuits against us. A defect, error or failure in one of our products could result in injury, death or property damage and significantly
damage our reputation and support for our products in general. We anticipate this risk will grow as our products begin to be used in U.S.
domestic airspace and urban areas.

Although
we maintain insurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments
and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices
or at all. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost to us. Even if we are fully insured as it relates to
a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our brand and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We generally warrant our manufactured products, including hardware
and software, for a period of one year from the date of receipt of the product by the customer. After the first year, the customer can
pay for extended hardware warranty and software maintenance and upgrades on an annual basis in advance. Estimated future product warranty
claims are based on the expected number of field failures over the warranty commitment period, the term of the product warranty period,
and the costs for repair, replacement and other associated costs. Our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates, claims
levels, material usage and product re-integration and handling costs. While costs that we have incurred historically under our warranty
obligations have not been material, the costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty related legal proceedings, are variable
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Because
our products are relatively new and we do not yet have the benefit of long-term experience observing products’ performance in the
field, our estimates of a product’s lifespan and incidence of claims may be inaccurate. Should actual product failure rates, claims
levels, material usage, product re-integration and handling costs, defects, errors, bugs or other issues differ from the original estimates,
we could end up incurring materially higher warranty or recall expenses than we anticipate.

Our Optimus System
™

makes use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have occasionally been observed to catch
fire or vent smoke and flames. If such events occur with our products, we could face liability associated with our warranty, for damage
or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition
and operating results.

The
battery packs in our Optimus™ drone use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers and cell phones. On
occasion, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke
and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into
flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of
these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur,
which would damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of
electrocution if individuals who attempt to repair battery packs on our vehicles do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols.
Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely
affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

20

Due to the volatile
and flammable nature of certain components of our products and equipment, fires or explosions may disrupt our business or cause significant
injuries, which could adversely affect our financial results.

The
development and manufacture of certain of our products involves the handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials as well
as high power equipment. From time to time, these activities may result in incidents that could cause us to temporarily shut down or otherwise
disrupt some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and/or fatalities. We
have safety and loss prevention programs that require detailed reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety
audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies, however our
insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all claims and losses related to such incidents. We may experience such incidents in the
future, which could result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Our technology,
products and services have only been developed in the last several years and we have had only limited opportunities to deploy and assess
their performance in the field at full scale.

The current generation of our FullMAX, Optimus System™ and Iron
Drone Raider™ technology platforms have only been developed in the last several years and will continue to evolve. Deploying and
operating our technology is complex and, until recently, had been done primarily by a small number of customers. As the size, complexity
and scope of our deployments grow we have been able to test product performance at a greater scale and in a variety of new geographic
settings and environmental conditions. As the number, size and complexity of our deployments grow and we deploy our technology platforms
for new applications in new critical infrastructure industries, we may encounter unforeseen operational, technical and other challenges,
some of which could cause significant delays, trigger contractual penalties, result in unanticipated expenses, and/or damage to our reputation,
each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to respond
to evolving technological changes, our products and services could become obsolete or less competitive.

We
operate in highly competitive industries characterized by new and rapidly evolving technologies, standards, regulations, customer requirements,
as well as frequent product introductions and revisions. Accordingly, our operating results depend upon our ability to develop and introduce
new products and services, our ability to reduce production costs of our existing products. The process of developing new technologies
and products is complex, and if we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing products and services or
acceptable new products and services that keep pace with technological developments or industry standards, our products may become obsolete,
less marketable and less competitive and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly harmed.

We depend on our
ability to develop new products and to enhance and sustain the quality of existing products.

Our
growth and future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance
and sustain the quality and marketability of our existing products. As such, we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial
investments in technology development. In the future, we may not have the necessary capital, or access to capital on acceptable terms,
to fund necessary levels of research and development. Even with adequate capital resources, we may nonetheless experience unforeseen problems
in the development or performance of our technologies or products. In addition, we may not meet our product development schedules and,
even if we do, we may not develop new products fast enough to provide sufficient differentiation from our competitors’ products,
which may be more successful.

We expect to incur
substantial research and development costs and devote significant resources to identifying and commercializing new products and services,
which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result in revenue to us. 

Our future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing
products to new applications and new environments, and introducing new products and services that achieve market acceptance. We plan to
incur substantial research and development costs as part of our efforts to design, develop and commercialize new products and services
and enhance existing products. For example, we will incur research and development costs to improve the functionality of our acoustic
DAA solution configuration in certain environments, in addition to integrating new payloads to broaden the functionality of our Optimus
System™ and Iron Drone Raider™. Further, our research and development programs may not produce successful results, and our
new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable, which could materially harm
our business, prospects, financial results and liquidity.

21

If our products
do not interoperate with our customers’ other systems, the purchase or deployment of our products and services may be delayed or
cancelled.

Our
products are designed to interface with our customers’ other systems, each of which may have different specifications and utilize
multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of these products
as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in
the hardware used in our customers’ systems, we may need to modify our products or services to fix or overcome these errors so that
our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products and services do not interoperate with our customers’ systems,
customers may seek to hold us liable, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be delayed
or cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation or brand, and seriously harm our prospects, business, financial
condition or results of operations.

The Company operates in a competitive market.

The
Company faces competition and new competitors will continue to emerge throughout the world. Services offered by the Company’s competitors
may take a larger share of customer spending than anticipated, which could cause revenue generated from the Company’s products and
services to fall below expectations. It is expected that competition in these markets will intensify. If competitors of the Company develop
and market more successful products or services, offer competitive products or services at lower price points, or if the Company does
not produce consistently high-quality and well-received products and services, revenues, margins, and profitability of the Company will
decline.

The Company’s ability
to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, the Company’s pricing of services and equipment, quality of customer
service and field support, development of new and enhanced products and services in response to customer demands and changing technology,
reach and quality of sales and distribution channels and capital resources. Competition could lead to a reduction in the rate at which
the Company adds new customers, a decrease in the size of the Company’s market share and a decline in its customers.

We rely on our
management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key officers, employees, contractors and
other service providers or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition or results
of operations.

We depend, in part, on the performance of Eric Brock, our Chief Executive
Officer and President, Neil Laird, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Markus Nottelmann, Chief Executive Officer
of Ondas Networks, Menashe Shahar, the Chief Technology Officer of Ondas Networks, Oshri Lugassi the Co-Chief Executive Officer of OAS,
Meir Kliner the President of OAS and Yishay Curelaru the Chief Financial Officer of Airobotics to operate and grow our business. The loss
of any of Messrs. Brock, Laird, Nottelmann, Shahar, Lugassi, Kliner or Curelaru could negatively impact our ability to execute our business
strategies. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Brock, Nottelmann, Shahar, Lugassi, Kliner and Curelaru,
we may be unable to retain them or replace any of them if we lose their services for any reason.

Our
future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, product development, operations,
sales, technical and other personnel in the United States and abroad. Even in today’s economic climate, competition for these types
of personnel is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. Given the lengthy sales cycles with utilities and deployment periods of our networking
platform and solutions, the loss of key personnel at any time could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

22

Cyberattacks through
security vulnerabilities could lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation
or competitive position.

Security
vulnerabilities may arise from our hardware, software, employees, contractors or policies we have deployed, which may result in external
parties gaining access to our networks, datacenters, cloud datacenters, corporate computers, manufacturing systems, and or access to accounts
we have at our suppliers, vendors, and customers. They may gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or attack
the networks causing denial of service or attempt to hold our data or systems in ransom. The vulnerability could be caused by inadequate
account security practices such as failure to timely remove employee access when terminated. To mitigate these security issues, we have
implemented measures throughout our organization, including firewalls, backups, encryption, employee information technology policies and
user account policies. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be sufficient to avoid cyberattacks. If any of these types
of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners and customers
could be materially damaged, our reputation could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant
liability.

Further,
if we fail to adequately maintain our infrastructure, we may have outages and data loss. Excessive outages may affect our ability to timely
and efficiently deliver products to customers or develop new products and solutions. Such disruptions and data loss may adversely impact
our ability to fulfill orders, patent our intellectual property or protect our source code, and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales
or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

Unauthorized
use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems,
breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through employee or contractor error, theft or misuse,
or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur,
our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations,
related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons
and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized
access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure
of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We do not control
certain aspects of the manufacturing process.

Our
reliance on a small number of manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced
control over quality assurance, product costs and product supply including delays in transportation and delivery. Any manufacturing disruption
by our usual manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders. We may be unable to manage our relationships with our usual manufacturers
effectively as they may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations
or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery. Similarly, to the extent that our usual manufacturers procure materials
on our behalf, we may not benefit from any warranties received by our usual manufacturers from the suppliers or otherwise have recourse
against the original supplier of the materials or even the manufacturer. In such circumstances, if the original supplier were to provide
us or our usual manufacturers with faulty materials, we might not be able to recover the costs of such materials or be compensated for
any damages that arise as a result of the inclusion of the faulty components in our products.

One
or more of our usual manufacturers may suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems
in its manufacturing operations, or seek to terminate its relationship with us, or we may choose to change or add additional manufacturers
for other reasons. Additionally, we do not have long-term supply agreements with our usual manufacturers. As a result, we may be unable
to renew or extend our agreement on terms favorable to us, if at all. Although the manufacturing services required to manufacture and
assemble our products may be readily available from a number of established manufacturers, it may be risky, time consuming and costly
to qualify and implement new manufacturer relationships.

Any
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

23

If critical components
or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur
delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which could damage our business.

In
order to produce our Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™ and related safety systems, we obtain certain hardware
components, as well as subsystems and systems from a limited group of suppliers, some of which are sole source suppliers. We do not
have long-term agreements with any of these suppliers that obligate them to continue to sell components, subsystems, systems or
products to us. Our reliance on these suppliers involves significant risks and uncertainties, including whether our suppliers will
provide an adequate supply of required components, subsystems, or systems of sufficient quality, will increase prices for the
components, subsystems or systems and will perform their obligations on a timely basis.

In
addition, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products and in our development programs, are periodically
subject to supply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Particularly,
the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and a global shortage of semiconductors, creating substantial uncertainty
regarding our suppliers’ continued production of key components for our products. If any additional shortages occur and we are unable
to obtain components from third party suppliers in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at acceptable
prices, then we may not be able to timely complete development programs or deliver our products on a timely or cost effective basis to
our customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with us, increase our costs and seriously harm our business, results
of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling
to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative
suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant
delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish
alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products.

We currently do
not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing which exposes us to fluctuations in component, materials and equipment prices.
Substantial increases in these prices would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results.

Because we currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed
pricing, we are subject to fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials, parts and components and equipment we use in the production
of our Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™. Substantial increases in the prices for such raw materials, components and
equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased prices.
Any attempts to increase prices of our automated data solutions in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by our customers
and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

We may pursue additional strategic transactions
in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.

We intend to consider additional
potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses,
products or technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current or future business. We may also consider, from time
to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments.
Should our relationships fail to materialize into significant agreements, or should we fail to work efficiently with these companies,
we may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

These activities, if successful,
create risks such as, among others: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and
products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential
unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management’s attention from other
business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or
equity securities; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and (c) the acquisition
or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential
to either dilute the interests of our existing shareholders or result in the issuance of, or assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments,
joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources. Any such activities
may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed to such activities will not be available
to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to
consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability to take advantage of
growth opportunities or address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may negatively affect our operating results.

Additionally, any impairment
of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition
or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may not result in their anticipated
benefits, and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations
or successfully combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions.

24

If the Company
is required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company’s financial condition and results could be negatively
affected.

Goodwill impairment arises
when there is deterioration in the capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash flows, and the fair value of the goodwill dips below
its book value. The Company is required to review its goodwill for impairment at least annually. Events that may trigger goodwill impairment
include deterioration in economic conditions, increased competition, loss of key personnel, and regulatory action. Should any of these
occur, an impairment of goodwill could have a negative effect on the assets of the Company.

In December 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative analysis and
proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the OAS
reporting unit. Using a discounted cash flow model and market approach model with updated forecasts for revenue and cash flows, it was
determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of December 31, 2024, and no further impairment
to goodwill was necessary as of December 31, 2024. See Note 5 – Goodwill and Business Acquisition of the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill.

War, terrorism,
and other acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our clients and our product and service delivery.

Our business may be adversely
affected by regional or global instability, disruption or destruction, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil
insurrection or social unrest. For example, the war in Israel and the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia may
affect the markets in which we operate. Such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for the products and services
provided by us and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events pose risks
which could materially adversely affect our financial results.

Since Airobotics is located in Israel, the Company has considered various
ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters. All of the Company’s workforce in Israel returned to work
and inventory production restraints have eased. The Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could
adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to support future operations, including the Company’s
ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™ and the Iron Drone Raider™ and to ship them
outside of Israel. To date, we have not had material disruptions to our ability to produce, manage and deliver products and services to
customers as our U.S. teams have supported our ongoing operations in Israel and the Middle East; however, a prolonged war or an escalation
of the current conditions in Israel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Due
to the ongoing and evolving nature of these events, the extent of the adverse effect on our business operations is still unknown.

We may not be able
to secure adequate insurance policies, or secure insurance policies at reasonable prices.

We maintain general liability
insurance, aviation flight testing insurance, aircraft liability coverage, directors and officers insurance, and other insurance policies
and we believe our level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims. However, there can be no assurance
that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable
cost. Further, we expect our insurance needs and costs to increase as we grow our commercial operations and expand into new markets and
it is uncertain if such insurance will be available on commercially reasonable terms.

The Company will be affected by operational
risks and may not be adequately insured for certain risks.

The Company will be affected
by a number of operational risks and the Company may not be adequately insured for certain risks, including: labor disputes; catastrophic
accidents; fires; blockades or other acts of social activism; changes in the regulatory environment; impact of non-compliance with laws
and regulations; natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, floods, earthquakes and ground movements. There is no assurance
that the foregoing risks and hazards will not result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s technologies, personal injury
or death, environmental damage, adverse impacts on the Company’s operation, costs, monetary losses, potential legal liability and
adverse governmental action, any of which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows, earnings and financial
condition. Furthermore, the unmanned aerial systems industry lacks a formative insurance market. As a result, the Company may be subject
to or affected by liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which the Company cannot insure or which the Company
may elect not to insure because of the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on the Company’s future
cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.

Litigation may
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material
to our financial condition as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required.
The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a significant diversion of our resources, and there is no guarantee
that we will be able to successfully defend against any such litigation regardless of particular merits. There also may be adverse publicity
associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are
valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available on favorable terms, at all, or in sufficient amounts to
cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any
claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.

25

Our cash could
be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fail.

The
Company maintains domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks. The domestic bank
deposit balances may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. Also, in the foreign markets we serve, we also maintain cash deposits in foreign
banks, some of which are not insured or partially insured by the FDIC or other similar agency. These balances could be impacted if one
or more of the financial institutions in which we deposit monies fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit
markets.

Risks Related to Regulatory
Requirements

We and our customers
operate in a highly regulated business environment and changes in regulation could impose costs on us or make our products less economical.

Our
products and services and our utility customers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and regulations
applicable to us and our products govern, among other things, the manner in which our products communicate, and the environmental impact
and electrical reliability of our products. Additionally, our critical infrastructure customers are often regulated by national, state
and/or local bodies, including public utility commissions, the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the FAA,
the FCC, Federal Rail Association, Israeli Defense Export Controls Agency of the Ministry of Defense and other bodies. Prospective customers
may be required to gain approval from any or all of these organizations prior to implementing our products and services, including specific
permissions related to the cost recovery of these systems. Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for implementation and
operation of our products, which may result in unforeseen delays. We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government
regulations applicable to us or our utility customers. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to
comply with evolving regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed on us or our utility customers in the future. Such costs
could make our products less economical and could impact our utility customers’ willingness to adopt our products, which could materially
and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore,
changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect critical infrastructure industries could have a potentially adverse effect
on our customers’ interest or ability to implement our technologies. Many regulatory jurisdictions have implemented rules that provide
financial incentives for the implementation of energy efficiency and demand response technologies, often by providing rebates or through
the restructuring of utility rates. If these programs were to cease, or if they were restructured in a manner inconsistent with the capabilities
enabled by our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.

Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals
from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put on the use of small UAS in response to public privacy and other concerns,
may prevent us from expanding the sales of our drone solutions to industrial and government customers in the United States.

The regulation of small UAS for commercial use
in the United States is undergoing substantial change and the ultimate treatment is uncertain.

On February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of
2012 was enacted, establishing various deadlines for the FAA to allow expanded use of small UAS for both public and commercial applications.
On June 21, 2016, the FAA released its final rules regarding the routine use of certain small UAS (under 55 pounds) in the U.S. National
Airspace System pursuant to the act (the “Part 107 Rules”). The Part 107 Rules, which became effective in August 2016, provided
safety regulations for small UAS conducting non-recreational operations and contain various limitations and restrictions for such operations,
including a requirement that operators keep UAS within visual-line-of-sight and prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground
who are not directly participating in the operation of the UAS. On December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules requiring remote identification
of drones and allowing operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. On June 8, 2021, the FAA announced
the formation of an Aviation Rulemaking Committee (“ARC”) to develop new rules to further define regulations for the operations
of UAS Beyond Visual Line-of-Site (“BVLOS”). The timing of additional rulemaking is uncertain as is the outcome of the still
developing regulatory environment related to the operation of small UAS. Additionally, recent focus on reducing the size of the federal
workforce could negatively impact the availability of resources within the FAA which could delay our progress towards certification.

We
cannot assure you that any final rules enacted in furtherance of the FAA’s announced proposals will result in the expanded use of
our drones and drone solutions by commercial and industrial entities. In addition, there exists public concern regarding the privacy
and other implications of U.S. commercial use of small UAS. This concern has included calls to develop explicit written policies and procedures
establishing usage limitations. We cannot assure you that the response from regulatory agencies, customers and privacy advocates to these
concerns will not delay or restrict the adoption of small UAS by the commercial use markets. 

26

Substantially
all our current wireless networking products depend on the availability and are subject to the use of licensed radio frequencies regulated
by the FCC in the United States.

Substantially
all of our current wireless networking products are designed to communicate wirelessly via licensed radio frequencies and therefore depend
on the availability of adequate radio spectrum in order to operate. It is possible that the FCC or the U.S. Congress could adopt additional
regulations or policies which are or may change or modify current regulations or policies so that they are, harmful to our business
or incompatible with our current or future product offerings, as well as products currently installed in the field. Additional regulations
or policies or changes or modifications to current regulations or policies may require modification or replacement of our products, including
products currently installed in the field, at significant, or even prohibitive, cost to us, and may require changes or modifications to,
or termination of, ongoing or planned projects. Any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

As a manufacturer
of commercial UAS, we are subject to various government regulations, restrictions and requirements, and may be subject to additional regulations
in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm, restrict or add costs to our business.

As
a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, restrictions and requirements, including, in
the United States, those issued under the Consumer Products Safety Act, as well as those issued under product safety and consumer protection
statutes in our international markets. Failure to comply with any applicable product safety or consumer protection regulation could result
in sanctions that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Governments
and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety
and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection
regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials,
in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly,
increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expenses in the event any of our products were found to not comply
with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.

Our business is
subject to federal, state and international laws regarding data protection, privacy, and information security, as well as confidentiality
obligations under various agreements, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could damage our reputation,
expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business and operating results.

In connection with our business, we receive, collect, process and retain
certain personal and confidential customer information. As a result, we are subject to increasingly rigorous federal, state and international
laws regarding privacy and data protection. Personal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the United
States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues
worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety
of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies. We also execute confidentiality and data protection agreements with various
parties under which we are required to protect their confidential information.

The United States federal and various state and foreign governments
have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including
end-customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorney generals are applying federal and state consumer protection
laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, and other
jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the processing of personal information
obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within or processing personal information that falls within their jurisdiction.
These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States in certain areas, whereas U.S. laws may impose requirements
not included in their international counterparts. Such laws and regulations may, for example, require companies to implement new privacy
and security policies and practices, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such
companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals’
consent to use personal information for certain purposes.

27

We
also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and
information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact of such
future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective
in 2020, provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies. Additionally, we expect that existing
laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted differently in the future. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the regulatory
framework for the future of personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States with regulations such as the recently
adopted General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which imposes more stringent European Union data protection requirements,
provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations,
including the adoption of the GDPR, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations
could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products,
require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase
our revenue.

Although
we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other
legal obligations that apply to us, such laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and
applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations,
our practices or the features of our products. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry
standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, and our efforts to do so may cause us to incur significant costs or require
changes to our business practices, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any failure or perceived failure by
us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations,
or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer
of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and
penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation
and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations,
policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us,
damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.

We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory
regimes, and we could be harmed by changes to, or the interpretation or the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions
in which it operates.

In addition to the United States, Airobotics operates in Israel,
Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The international scope of Airobotics’ business requires us to comply with a wide range
of national and local laws and regulations, which may in certain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other. Restrictions imposed
on us by the Israel government, as a result of strategic ties and treaties with foreign countries, limit our activities and access to
certain countries, in a manner that may restrict and even prevent in certain situations our operations in certain countries and affect
its results.

With
the geographic expansion of our business, and that of our subsidiaries, into new markets, we have become subject to additional and changing
legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards.

In
countries where we operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new interpretations of existing laws and regulations
or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning our business. Changes in government regulation of or successful challenges to the
business model used by us in certain markets may require us to change our existing business models and operations. Any additional regulatory
scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate
in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary
greatly or conflict between different operating countries. This may negatively impact our revenue and profitability by preventing our
business from reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur additional costs, which
would adversely impact business. Our inability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead
to regulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings
and adversely affect our business.

We may become subject to increasing global
trade laws and regulations.

We
may become subject to increasing global trade laws and regulations, including economic sanctions, export controls, and import laws. Failure
to comply with global trade laws and regulations can result in penalties and reputational harm. Our international sales efforts expose
us to increased risk under these laws and regulations, and increasing and evolving global trade laws could impact our business.

In addition, the global economy has recently seen a rise in tariffs
and threats of tariffs. While tariffs have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to
date, new tariffs could increase the costs of raw materials and other goods, both for us and our suppliers, which could impact our business,
particularly as we begin to scale our manufacturing operations.

28

Risks Related to our
Intellectual Property

Our ability to
protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain.

We
rely primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary
technologies and intellectual property. As of this filing, the Ondas Networks segment held a total of eight issued patents in the U.S.,
six issued international patents, seven patent pending applications in the U.S., and five international pending patent application. The
Ondas Networks segment patents expire between 2029 and 2041, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
As of this filing, the OAS segment held a total of six issued patents in the U.S., 22 issued international patents, and four international
pending patent applications. The OAS segment patents expire between 2034 and 2048, subject to any patent extensions that may be available
for such patents. Our intellectual property incorporates internally developed software and hardware design incorporating machine and computer
vision and was developed with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This intellectual property is critical to the development
of end-to-end systems which reliably enable the automated operation of drones in real-world environments.

We
have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes. Currently, several of our issued
U.S. patents as well as various pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relate to our FullMAX systems, Optimus System™, and
Iron Drone Raider™ and are therefore important to the functionality of our products. If we fail to timely file a patent application
in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications
will be approved in a timely manner or at all. The rights granted to us under our patents, and the rights we are seeking to have granted
in our pending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage. In addition, those rights could
be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors, or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings.
The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier or cheaper for our competitors to offer the same
or similar products or technologies. Even if we are successful in receiving patent protection for certain products and processes, our
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes which are comparable or superior to ours
without infringing on our intellectual property rights. Due to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual
property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if patents
are granted outside the U.S., effective enforcement in those countries may not be available without significant cost and time expense
or at all.

We
rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. Third parties may challenge our
use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which
could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote additional resources to marketing new brands. Further, we cannot
assure you that competitors will not infringe upon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.

We
also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protectable by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try
to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers regarding our intellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event
of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of those agreements, we may not be provided with meaningful protection for our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by
competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, officers, employees, contractors and other service providers use
intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in the related or resulting know-how and
inventions. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other technologies not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently
developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

If
a competitor infringes upon one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents, trademarks
and other rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the industry in which we operate
is subject to rapid change and constant evolution and, consequently, patent positions in our industry can be uncertain. Even if successful,
litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and
time consuming and could divert management’s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources
or desire to defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation also puts
our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we
may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies
awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may harm our business, financial condition and
operating results.

29

Our business may
suffer if it is alleged or found that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

Our
industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other
violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other intellectual
property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements from companies like ours. To date we
have received no claims with respect to our infringement of intellectual property or patents but, in the future, third parties may claim
that we are infringing upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be or may become contractually obligated
to indemnify our utility customers or other third parties that use or resell our products in the event our products are alleged to infringe
a third-party’s intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly
to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and cause us to incur significant
expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. Further,
claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign affected products, delay affected product offerings, enter into
costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing,
selling or distributing the affected products. If we cannot or do not license the alleged infringed technology on reasonable terms or
at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our
utility customers may not purchase our products if they are concerned that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights.
This could reduce the market opportunity for the sale of our products and services. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable
to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.

In
addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented technology, trade secrets and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information
by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our officers, employees, contractors and other service
providers and with parties with which we do business. These agreements may be breached, which breach may result in the misappropriation
of such information, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will
prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology.

Moreover,
our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our officers,
employees, contractors, other service providers, or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others
in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons,
our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We use open-source
software in our products and services that may subject our products and services to general release or require us to re-engineer our products
and services, which may cause harm to our business.

We
use open-source software in connection with our products and services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open-source software
into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source software and/or compliance with open source license terms.
Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance with
open-source licensing terms. Some open-source software licenses require users who distribute open-source software as part of their software
to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source code
on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software in our products and services and try to ensure that
none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related product or that would otherwise breach the terms
of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages
for breach of contract, re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished
on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely
affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

30

Intellectual property
rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.

The
degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations,
and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:

●
others
may be able to make devices that are the same as or similar to our remote radios but that are not covered by the claims of the patents
that we own;

●
we
or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications
that we own;

●
we
might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;

●
others
may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual
property rights;

●
it
is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;

●
issued
patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal
challenges;

●

our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and

●

we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.

Risks Related to our Financial Results

We will need to
generate significant sales to achieve profitable operations.

We
intend to increase our operating expenses substantially in connection with the planned expansion of our business, establishment of our
sales and marketing infrastructure, our ongoing research and development activities, and the commensurate development of our management
and administrative functions, but there is no guarantee that we will succeed in these endeavors. We will need to generate significant
sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be able to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able to achieve,
sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we expect, or if our
operating expenses exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our future profitability
may be dependent upon achieving cost reductions and projected economies of scale from increasing manufacturing quantities of our products.
Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs and projected economies of scale could materially adversely affect our business.

We
do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us
to manufacture (or contract for the manufacture of) these products in commercial quantities while meeting the volume, speed, quality,
price, engineering, design and production standards required to successfully market our products. Our failure to develop such manufacturing
processes and capabilities in locations that can efficiently service our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our future profitability is, in part, dependent upon achieving increased savings
from volume purchases of raw materials and component parts, achieving acceptable manufacturing yield and capitalizing on machinery efficiencies.
We expect our suppliers to experience a sharp increase in demand for their products. As a result, we may not have reliable access to supplies
that we require or be able to purchase such materials or components at cost effective prices. There is no assurance that we will ever
be in a position to realize any material, labor and machinery cost reductions associated with higher purchasing power and higher production
levels. Failure to achieve these cost reductions could adversely impact our business and financial results.

31

If business growth
falls short of expectations, we may need to obtain additional capital to fund our growth, operations, and obligations.

We
may require additional capital to fund our growth, operations, and obligations if our growth plan falls short or takes more time than
we anticipate. As our business has grown, we have managed periods of tight liquidity by accessing capital from our stockholders and their
affiliates. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including:

●
our
ability to enter into new agreements with customers or to extend the terms of our existing agreements with customers, and the terms of
such agreements;

●
the
success of our sales efforts;

●
our
working capital requirements related to the costs of inventory and accounts receivable;

●
costs
of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel;

●
expenditures
and investments to implement our business strategy; and

●
the
identification and successful completion of acquisitions.

We
may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other
sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, when needed. For example,
increases in interest rates could negatively impact the costs of seeking additional funds through debt offerings and/or borrowings. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the
growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our revenue is
not predictable and recognition of a significant portion of it will be deferred into future periods.

Once
a customer decides to move forward with a large-scale deployment of our products and services, the timing of and our ability to recognize
related revenue will depend on several factors, some of which may not be under our control. These factors include shipment schedules
that may be delayed or subject to modification, the rate at which our utility customers choose to deploy our products in their network,
customer acceptance of all or any part of our products and services, our contractual commitments to provide new or enhanced functionality
at some point in the future, other contractual provisions such as liquidated damages, our suppliers’ ability to provide an adequate
supply of components, the requirement to obtain regulatory approval, and our ability to deliver quality products according to expected
schedules. In light of these factors, the application of complex revenue recognition rules to our products and services has required
us to defer, and in the future will likely continue to require us to defer, a significant amount of revenue until undetermined future
periods. It may be difficult to predict the amount of revenue that we will recognize in any given period and amounts recognized may fluctuate
significantly from one period to the next. 

Our exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increased.

Airobotics
conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States, which also operate in their respective local currencies,
the most significant of which are currently the Israeli New Shekel, the Singapore Dollar and the Emirati Dirham. Therefore, our international
operations accounts for a significant portion of our overall operations than they previously did and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates has increase. Because our financial statements continue to be presented in U.S. dollars, the local currencies
of Airobotics will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements,
thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.

32

If our internal
controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in
our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.

As
a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. Our
testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial
reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner,
or if we or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material
weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory
authorities, including SEC enforcement actions, and we could be required to restate our financial results, any of which would require
additional financial and management resources.

If
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial
statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to
expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise
cause a decline in investor confidence.

We
continue to invest in more robust technology and resources to manage those reporting requirements. Implementing the appropriate changes
to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, result in substantial costs and require significant time to complete.
Any difficulties or delays in implementing these controls could impact our ability to timely report our financial results. For these reasons,
we may encounter difficulties in the timely and accurate reporting of our financial results, which would impact our ability to provide
our investors with information in a timely manner. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information,
and our stock price could decline.

In
addition, any such changes do not guarantee that we will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure
to maintain that adequacy could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results.

Risks Related to our
Common Stock

We have limited
trading activity and as a result, the price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your
investment.

The
limited trading activity and resulting volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your
shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject
to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to:

●

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;

●

adverse results from delays in our product development;

●

legal, political, governmental or other regulatory developments, decisions or interpretations;

●

publication of research reports or coverage about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations;

●

perceptions about the market acceptance of our products and services, and the recognition of our brand;

●

adverse publicity about our products and services, operating or financial results or industry in general;

33

●

overall performance of the equity markets;

●

introduction or discontinuation of products or services, or announcements of significant contracts, licenses or acquisitions, by us or our competitors;

●

additions or departures of key personnel;

●

threatened or actual litigation and government or regulatory investigations;

●

sale of shares of our common stock by us or members of our management or our stockholders; and

●

general economic conditions, both global and regional. 

Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “ONDS.”
 There can be no assurance that trading of our common stock on such market will be sustained. In the event that our common
stock is not listed on Nasdaq, or if we do not sustain such listing, our common stock could be quoted only on the OTC Markets. Under such
circumstances, you may find it significantly more difficult to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations for our common stock and our common
stock may become substantially less attractive to certain purchasers, such as financial institutions, hedge funds, and other similar investors.

These
and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate unpredictably and substantially, which may negatively
affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries,
including our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies.
Accordingly, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and
these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.

Securities
class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market
price of a company’s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s
attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Concentration of
ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from
influencing significant corporate decisions.

Our
executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the
aggregate, beneficially own approximately 23.2% of our outstanding common stock as of March 10, 2025, and as of the date of this filing.
As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant
corporate transactions.

Some
of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, they may be more interested in selling our company
to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.

34

We may issue more
shares to raise additional capital, which may result in substantial dilution.

Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance
of a maximum of 300,000,000 shares of common stock. Any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional
securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders.
In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may be higher or lower than the price per share of our common stock at that time.
Also, we have reserved 11,000,000 and 3,333,334 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Ondas Holdings
Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2021 Plan”) and 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”),
respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2021 Plan and 2018 Plan
is 6,573,078 and 1,207,078 shares of common stock, respectively. The issuance of such additional shares of common stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into common stock, may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, if all or a substantial
portion of these shares are resold into the public markets then the trading price of our common stock may decline.

Our Board may issue
and fix the terms of shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the voting power of holders
of our common stock or any change in control of our Company.

Our
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred
stock, $0.0001 par value per share, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board.
Our Board is empowered, without the need to obtain stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation,
conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In
the event of such issuances, the preferred stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or
preventing a change in control of our company.

If securities or
industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading
volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business, which research and reports are not and would not be subject to our control. We currently do not have and may never
obtain research coverage by securities analysts, and industry analysts that currently cover us may cease to do so. If no securities analysts
commence coverage of our company, or if industry analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be
materially and adversely impacted. In the event we obtain securities analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us
downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may be materially and adversely
impacted. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock
could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

We do not intend
to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock nor are we under any obligation to declare or pay such cash dividends. We
currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and the development and growth of our business, and we do not expect
to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be limited
by any future debt instruments or preferred securities. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common
stock if the market price of our common stock increases to a price above the price you paid for them and you sell such shares.

35

If our shares become
subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.

The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in
connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than
securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided
that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we
do not retain a listing on Nasdaq and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock.
The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver
a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting
any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that
the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt
of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of
a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market
for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling shares.

Certain provisions
of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us
and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders’ best interest.

Certain
provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make it more difficult for a third-party to
acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders’ best interest. For
example, Nevada law provides that approval of two-thirds of the stockholders is required to remove a director, which may make it more
difficult for a third-party to gain control of the Company. This concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by our
minority stockholders.

Our bylaws designate
the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions, which could
limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company and its
directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.

Unless
we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada
(the “Court”) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director,
officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against
the Company, any director or the Company’s officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes
(the “NRS”), Chapters 78 or 92A of the NRS or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws, or (iv) any
action asserting a claim against the Company, any director or the Company’s officers or employees governed by the internal affairs
doctrine. However, each of these clauses (i) through (iv) will not apply to any claim (x) as to which the Court determines that there
is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction
of the Court within ten (10) days following such determination), (y) for which the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction,
or (z) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court, including pursuant to Section 27 of the
Exchange Act, which provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange
Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), provides for concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability
created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and as such the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above
would not apply to such suits.

36

Risks Related to the Notes

We may not have
the ability to pay interest on the Notes or to redeem the Notes.

The
Notes bear interest at a rate of 3% per year and add amortization payments with respect to the principal amount of the Notes and accrued
and unpaid interest are due and payable monthly. If we are unable to satisfy certain equity conditions, we will be required to pay all
amounts due on any installment date in cash. If a change of control occurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase, for cash,
all or a portion of their Notes. Our ability to pay amortization payments and interest on the Notes, to repurchase the Notes, to fund
working capital needs, and fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent,
this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, and other factors that are beyond our
control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will continue to generate
cash flow from operations at a level sufficient to permit us to pay the interest on the Notes or to repurchase or redeem the Notes or
that our cash needs will not increase.

The
holder of the Notes can defer an installment payment due on any installment date to another installment date and may, on any installment
date accelerate the payment of amounts due on up to four future installment dates. Therefore, we may be required to repay the entire principal
amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in one lump sum on the maturity date of the Notes. If we are unable to satisfy certain
equity conditions, we will be required to pay all amounts due whether by deferral or acceleration in cash and we may not have sufficient
funds to repay the Notes under such circumstances.

Our
failure to make the required payments on the Notes would permit the holders of the Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Notes.
Such default may also lead to a default under our agreements governing any of our current and future indebtedness.

If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to service our indebtedness and meet our other needs,
we may have to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, obtain additional financing, reduce expenditures, or sell assets that we
deem necessary to our business. We cannot assure you that any of these measures would be possible or that additional financing could be
obtained on favorable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms would have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet our obligations to you under the Notes.

Provisions in the
Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.

Under
the terms of the Notes we are prohibited from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity
assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us, even where
the acquisition could be beneficial to you.

Future sales of
a significant number of our shares of Common Stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress
the market price of our shares of Common Stock or cause it to be highly volatile.

The conversion of
some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders, unless we satisfy any such conversions solely
with cash, and conversions of such Notes into shares of our Common Stock could depress the price of our Common Stock. We cannot predict
if and when these shares of our Common Stock will be resold in the public markets. We cannot predict the number of these shares that might
be resold nor the effect that future sales of our shares of Common Stock would have on the market price of our shares of Common Stock.
Sales of a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, may
result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock or cause it to be highly volatile and impair our ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity securities.

37

Our financing arrangements
contain, and we expect that other future loan agreements and financing arrangements will contain, customary covenants that may limit our
liquidity and corporate activities, which could limit our operational flexibility and have an adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Our
financial arrangements contain, and we expect that other future loan agreements and financing arrangements will contain, customary covenants
and event of default clauses, which may affect operational and financial flexibility. Such restrictions could affect, and in many respects
limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, or engage
in mergers or acquisitions. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary
capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our
ability to finance our future operations or capital needs.

As
a result of these restrictions, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some corporate actions. Our lenders’
interests may be different from ours and we may not be able to obtain their permission when needed. This may prevent us from taking actions
that we believe are in our best interests, which may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

For
more information regarding our obligations under the Notes please see Note 9 – Long-term Notes Payable in the accompanying Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.

Risk management and strategy

We
rely on our information technology to operate our business.
 We have policies and processes designed to protect our information technology
systems, some of which are managed by third parties, and resolve issues in a timely manner in the event of a cybersecurity threat or incident.

As
part of our broader risk management framework, we have identified the potential cybersecurity risks to our business and implemented structured
controls to mitigate them. Our business applications and hosting services are designed to minimize the impact of cybersecurity incidents,
with designated backup systems in place where necessary.

To
enhance cybersecurity resilience, we have implemented a structured Information Security Management System (ISMS) certified in accordance
with ISO 27001, providing a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity risks and aligning with industry best practices. Our risk
mitigation efforts include a combination of administrative, technical, and operational controls, such as real-time monitoring and detection
activities, anti-malware and endpoint protection solutions, annual employee cybersecurity training, regular security audits, third-party
penetration testing, and a clear communication and reporting structure to facilitate timely responses to security incidents.

We
have a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (CIRP) that defines roles, responsibilities, and reporting mechanisms, as well as a structured
incident response process covering preparation, detection, response, documentation, and post-incident analysis. This plan outlines possible
cybersecurity threats and response measures for incidents such as denial-of-service attacks, malicious code attacks, website defacement,
data corruption, and data leakage. In addition, we maintain a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in accordance with ISO 27001 to ensure operational
resilience, including detailed continuity procedures, system restoration timeframes, and recovery strategies for various scenarios.

38

To
address cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers, we have established procedures, policies, and tools for identifying,
assessing, and mitigating potential threats. This process begins with a third-party risk assessment, which is performed and updated as
needed. Our Information Security Guidelines for Suppliers ensure compliance with security standards, while our Access Control Policies
regulate third-party access to sensitive systems, and our Cloud System Information Security Procedures govern data security in cloud environments.
We also engage 
third-party
 consultants to assist in designing and enhancing our cybersecurity risk management framework, including penetration
testing and continuous threat monitoring.

To
date, 
we have 
not
 encountered cybersecurity threats or incidents that have had a material impact on our business.

Governance

Our
Board of Directors has specific oversight responsibility for cybersecurity, which also oversees our general risk management.

The Board
of Directors reviews and discusses with management our policies, practices and risks related to information security and cybersecurity.

Our
Chief Financial Officer has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring, and managing cybersecurity risks. Leaders of our Ondas Networks
and OAS segments, along with the Chief Financial Officer, meet quarterly to assess cybersecurity risks, identify emerging threats, and
evaluate our risk management framework.

The Chief Financial Officer provides quarterly updates to the Board of Directors on any cybersecurity-related
risks. Our incident response plan includes notifying the 
Board of Directors
 of any material threats or incidents as they arise.
 Although
these members of our senior management do not have direct cybersecurity expertise obtained through certifications, their experience managing
the Company, which includes consulting and coordinating as necessary with in-house and third-party information technology specialists,
enables them to effectively assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats.

At
OAS, risk management oversight is further managed through our Head of Information Security, who is responsible for overseeing the information
security aspects of our cybersecurity framework. Our Head of Information Security brings extensive expertise to the role, with military
experience in information security, a B.Sc. in Information Systems Engineering, and specialized training in computer and information systems
security/information assurance from the TÜV SÜD Academy. Additionally, our Head of Information Security is certified by the
Standards Institution of Israel as a Senior Internal Auditor for ISO 27001. Her areas of expertise include performing risk assessments,
developing business continuity plans, drafting information security policies and procedures, conducting internal audits, leading information
security training, and evaluating information systems

structured approach ensures that our cybersecurity governance remains robust, proactive, and aligned with industry best practices.

At
Ondas Networks, risk management is further managed through the use of expert third party companies to assist in managing relevant risks.
In particular, the Company outsources its information technology function and monitoring to a third-party provider whereby it benefits
from a professionally managed network monitoring, management, maintenance, detection and response system and a 24/7 security operations
center with both onsite and remote support services. Any cybersecurity incident would be reported to the Company promptly by our third-party
consultant.
