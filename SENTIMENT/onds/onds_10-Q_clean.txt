ONDAS HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Company

Ondas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas
Holdings”, “Ondas”, the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) was originally incorporated in
Nevada on 
December 22, 2014
, under the name of Zev Ventures Incorporated. On September 28, 2018, we acquired Ondas Networks Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Delaware Networks”), and changed our name to Ondas Holdings Inc. On August 5, 2021, we acquired American Robotics,
Inc. (“American Robotics” or “AR”), a Delaware corporation. On January 23, 2023, we acquired Airobotics, Ltd.
(“Airobotics”), an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone systems. On December 6, 2023, the Company formed Ondas Autonomous
Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation, as an intermediate holding company which now wholly-owns American Robotics and
Airobotics. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, amending
Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc.’s name to Ondas Autonomous Systems Inc. (“OAS”). On August 7, 2024, the Company formed
Ondas Networks Texas Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Texas Networks”). Pursuant to
a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 19, 2024, Delaware Networks merged with and into Texas Networks (the “Merger”)
with Texas Networks being the surviving entity resulting from the Merger and shall continuing to exist and being governed by the laws
of the State of Texas under the corporate name “Ondas Networks Inc.” (“Ondas Networks”).

As a result, Ondas Networks,
OAS, American Robotics and Airobotics became our subsidiaries. Ondas’ corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts.
Ondas Networks has offices and facilities in Sunnyvale, California, American Robotics’ offices and facilities are located in Sparks,
Maryland, and Airobotics’ offices and facilities are located in Petah Tikva, Israel.

Business Activity

Ondas is a leading provider
of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks, OAS, Airobotics, and American Robotics.
Ondas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics
and American Robotics. Ondas Networks and OAS together provide users in defense, homeland security, and critical infrastructure markets
with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas
Networks and OAS as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment.

Ondas Networks 

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the
Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT
applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time
connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required
in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drone operations, oil and gas, and public safety,
homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and
ensure a high degree of safety and security. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16
standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we
continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets.

5

We design, develop, manufacture,
sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, private, wide-area broadband networks.
Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. By upgrading their
legacy systems, customers benefit from significant increases in data throughput which enables new applications. We have targeted the North
American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications
systems utilizing dated narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited
data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. The freight rail operators
through the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), its advisory subsidiary MxV Rail, as well as the American Railway Engineering
and Maintenance Association (“AREMA”), have adopted the IEEE 802.16 standard for future private wireless networks. The IEEE
802.16t Direct Peer-to-Peer (“DPP”) protocol has been selected by the AAR as the new standard for Next Generation head-of-train
/ end-of-train (“HOT-EOT”) communications or “NGHE Gen4.” This new protocol for train telemetry operations enables
new safety and operational improvements to existing HOT-EOT applications.

Our software-based FullMAX
platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet
Protocol-based communications to provide security, more reliability and significant data throughput for our mission-critical infrastructure
customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy
serial and analog based protocols no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent
networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications
over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial
networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth.

Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS)

Our OAS business unit develops
and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises.
Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially
available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing
and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.

Our unique, fully autonomous
platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business
focuses on end-user entities in defense, homeland security, public safety, smart city, airport authorities, and other governmental entities
together with commercial operators of critical industrial and technology facilities such as oil & gas, seaports, mining, and heavy
construction as well as for data centers and semiconductor fabs. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-time aerial data
capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and
field area operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful
implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance,
handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.

Our portfolio companies, American
Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace
business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing
all the challenges arising along these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and
ongoing support.

OAS and its portfolio companies
have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification
(TC) from the FAA for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this
distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations
over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness
and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of
operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight
(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned
with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge
drone tech and capabilities.

Liquidity

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. As of June 30, 2025, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $
261,254,000
. As of June 30, 2025, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $
2,406,000
 and
short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $
17,644,000
, net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $
1,125,000
, including
accrued interest of approximately $
630,000
, of which approximately $
342,000
 is due to related parties. As of June 30, 2025, we had cash
and restricted cash of approximately $
68,551,000
 and working capital of approximately $
59,720,000
. We had approximately $
15,063,000
 of
net cash flows used in operations for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

In 2024, we raised approximately
$
36,997,000
 of net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Holdings, Ondas Networks, and OAS; approximately $
1,422,000
 of
net proceeds from issuance of secured notes in Ondas Networks; approximately $
7,304,000
 of net proceeds from issuing common stock, par
value $
0.0001
 (“Common Stock”), in Ondas Holdings, warrants in Ondas Holdings, and warrants in OAS; and approximately $
4,375,000

in net proceeds from issuing additional redeemable preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings.

As of June 30, 2025, we raised
approximately $
42,677,000
 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from a registered public offering, $
9,963,000
 from the exercise of stock
options and warrants in Ondas Holdings, $
923,000
 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Networks,
and $
365,000
 in Israeli government grants to Airobotics. Subsequent to June 30, 2025, the Company issued 
6,950,574
 shares as a result
of Installment Conversions on the 2024 Additional Notes (as defined below), repaying the 2024 Additional Notes in full. As of July 18,
2025, the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes (as defined below), 2023 Additional Notes (as defined below), and 2024 Additional Notes have
been repaid in full.

In the Company’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-Q as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025, management
concluded that substantial doubt existed about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring operating losses
and limited liquidity resources.

During the three months ended
June 30, 2025, the Company raised approximately $
42,677,000
 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from a registered public offering, and
approximately $
8,979,000
 from the exercise of stock options and warrants in Ondas Holdings. Management believes these actions sufficiently
alleviate the previously identified conditions that raised substantial doubt, and the Company will have sufficient capital resources to
fund its operations for the next twelve months from the date these interim financial statements are issued.

As of August 12, 2025, management
has concluded that substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists as of the issuance
date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of June 30, 2025, gross
profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued
and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable,
lines of credit or other sources.

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We also
will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research
and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and
cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional
notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable
terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to
fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or
limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management,
the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K”). The Company’s accounting policies are described
in the “
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
” in the 2024 Form 10-K and are updated, as necessary, in this Form
10-Q. The December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet data presented for comparative purposes was derived from the audited financial
statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2025,
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year or for any other subsequent interim period.

The unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries, Ondas Networks, OAS, American Robotics and Airobotics.
All inter-company accounts and transactions between these entities have been eliminated in these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. The functional currency of the Company and all of our subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.

Business Combinations

We utilize the purchase method
of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are
included in Ondas’ results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired, and liabilities
assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair
values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair
value on the acquisition date; these are recorded in either other accruals within current liabilities (for expected payments in less than
a year) or other non-current liabilities (for expected payments in greater than a year), both on our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent
changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition
date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original
acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of assets
acquired, and liabilities assumed in certain cases, may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a
period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other
business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets of an acquired business. The Company tests goodwill for impairment
on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist.
The Company evaluates qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment process.

8

The Company has recognized
goodwill as part of the American Robotics acquisition in 2021 and Airobotics acquisition in 2023. In December 2024, the Company bypassed
the qualitative analysis and proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry
out a valuation of the OAS reporting unit. Using a discounted cash flow model and market approach model with updated forecasts for revenue
and cash flows, it was determined that the fair value of the OAS reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of December 31,
2024.

Intangible assets represent
patents, licenses, software and allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business. The Company estimates
the fair value of its reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment
when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.

We amortize our intangible
assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis, over 
3
 years for software; 
10
 years for patents; 
3
-
10
 years for developed technology,

10
 years for licenses, trademarks, marketing-related assets and the FAA waiver; 
5
 years for customer relationships; and 
1
 year for non-compete
agreements.

Segment Information

Operating segments are defined
as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision
Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its
Chief Executive Officer. The Company determined it has 
two
 reportable segments: Ondas Networks and OAS as the CODM reviews financial information
for these two businesses separately. The Company has no inter-segment sales. 

Use of Estimates

The process of preparing financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such management estimates include those
relating to allocation of consideration for business combinations to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, revenue recognition,
inventory write-downs to reflect net realizable value, assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based awards and valuation allowances
against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The Company considers all
highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, we had 
no
 cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes cash that is not readily available for use in the Company’s
operating activities. At June 30, 2025, $
944,637
 of our restricted cash balance relates to minimum cash reserves required to be maintained
to cover bank guarantees issued related to new customer orders at OAS. The bank guarantees are valid through June 30, 2026, unless earlier
canceled. The remaining restricted cash balance at June 30, 2025 and at December 31, 2024, is attributable to minimum cash reserve requirements
for Airobotics’ credit cards. The Company periodically monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions
with which it invests. Periodically, throughout the six months ended, and as of June 30, 2025, the Company has maintained balances in
excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. As of June 30, 2025, the Company was $
66,418,510
 in excess of
FDIC insured limits.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated
at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for credit losses as well as net of any discounts or other forms of variable consideration.
We estimate allowance for credit losses by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates our customers may have an inability
to meet financial obligations, such as customer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended
period beyond contractual terms. We use assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record an allowance
to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These allowances are evaluated and adjusted as additional information
is received. We had 
no
 allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. During the three and six months ended June
30, 2025 and 2024, we recognized 
$0
 of expense related to credit losses.

9

Inventory

Inventories, which consist
solely of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value,
net of reserves for obsolete inventory. We continually analyze our slow-moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected
sales volumes and anticipated selling prices, we established reserves. Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced
by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down
to net realizable value. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 such reserves were $
221,044
.

Inventory consists of the

Property and Equipment

All additions, including improvements
to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and
equipment is principally recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives
typically are (i) 
3
 years for computer equipment, (ii) 
5
 years for vehicles and base stations and drones, (iii) 
7
 - 
17
 years for furniture
and fixtures, (iv) 
3
 to 
7
 years for development equipment and machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a 
straight-line
basis over the shorter of the lease term
 or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon the disposal of property, the asset and related
accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the amounts recorded therein for such items, and any resulting gain or loss is recorded
in operating expenses in the year of disposition. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are evaluated
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Such
indicators include significant technological changes, adverse changes in market conditions and/or poor operating results. The carrying
value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying
value. The amount of impairment loss recognized is the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset
or asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved. There was 
no
 impairment of long-lived assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Research and Development

Costs for research and development
are expensed as incurred except for research and development equipment with alternative future use. Research and development expenses
consist primarily of salaries, salary related expenses and costs of contractors and materials.

Government Grants

The government grant liability
was assumed through the acquisition of Airobotics and asset purchase of Iron Drone. Airobotics and Iron Drone receive government grants
from the Israel Innovation Authority (formerly: the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel, “the IIA”), and the grant funds
are repayable to the extent that future economic benefits are expected from the research project that will result in royalty-bearing sales.
A liability for grants received is first measured at fair value using a discount rate that reflects a market rate of interest. The difference
between the amount of the grant received and the fair value of the liability is accounted for as a government grant and recognized as
a reduction of research and development expenses.

10

At each reporting date, the
Company evaluates whether there is reasonable assurance that the liability recognized, in whole or in part, will not be repaid (since
the Company will not be required to pay royalties) based on the best estimate of future sales and using the original effective interest
method, which is 
17
-
19
%, and if so, the appropriate amount of the liability is derecognized through other income (expense). Amounts paid
as royalties are treated as a reduction of the liability. Royalty payments are due every nine months. There is no maturity date. The liability
exists until it is paid in full through royalty payments or the Company reports to the IIA there will be no further sales.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short- and long-term
debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate our fair value because of the short-term maturity
of such instruments. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles,
which are adjusted to fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
or the useful life has changed. Our estimate of the fair value of right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles is based on expected future
cash flows and actual results may differ from those estimates.

We have categorized our assets
and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level
1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Assets and liabilities recorded
in the balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs, as follows:

Level 1 
--

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2
 --

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3
 --

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Company had no Level 3
assets that are required to be valued at fair value as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

The Company had Level 3 liabilities
that are required to be valued at fair value as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The fair value of the government grant liability
is determined as the sum of 
3
% royalty payments on forecasted future sales, discounted using the effective interest method. As of June
30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company made the following assumptions: (i) royalty payments will be made on future sales through
2027, and (ii) the effective interest rate is a range of 
17
-
19
%. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balances for the Level 3 government grant liability measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs:

legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity financing as deferred offering
costs until such financing is consummated. After consummation of equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity
as a reduction of additional paid-in capital generated as a result of the offering. Should the planned equity financing be abandoned,
the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

In 2023 and 2024, Ondas Networks
Inc. entered into multiple agreements with a third party for the sale of redeemable preferred stock in Ondas Networks (see Note 9 –
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest). The preferred stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (
8
%) of the original
issue price and can be redeemed at the request of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary as follows:

(i)

In respect of the 2023 investments, for the greater of two times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.

(ii)

In respect of the 2024 investment, for the greater of one times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.

The applicable accounting
guidance requires an equity instrument that is redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if it
is redeemable (a) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (b) at the option of the holder, or (c) upon the occurrence
of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. As a result, the Company recorded the noncontrolling interest as redeemable
noncontrolling interest and classified it in temporary equity within its consolidated balance sheet initially at its acquisition-date
estimated redemption value or fair value. In addition, the Company has elected to accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the
full redemption value as of the earliest redemption date by accruing dividends at 
8
% per annum and accreting the redemption value to two
and one times the initial investment, respectively, using the effective interest rate method.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only
if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized uncertain
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 
50
% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement
are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions as part of the income tax provision.

12

Stock-based Compensation

We calculate stock-based compensation
expense for option awards (“Stock-based Award(s)”) based on the estimated grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”) and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We
account for forfeitures as they occur.

The Black-Scholes Model requires
the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting
period in determining the fair value of Stock-based Awards. The expected term is based on the “simplified method”, due to
the Company’s limited option exercise history. Under this method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service
vesting period and contractual term of the option award. As the Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the
Company has identified several public entities of similar size, complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility based on
the volatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense are reasonable,
these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition,
significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period.  

We recognize restricted stock
unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. Compensation associated with shares of Common Stock,
issued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized over the expected service period beginning on the measurement
date, which is generally the time the Company and the service provider enter into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares
in exchange for the services to be provided.

Shipping and Handling

We expense all shipping and
handling costs as incurred. These costs are included in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Advertising and Promotional Expenses

We expense advertising and
promotional costs as incurred. We recognized expense of $
49,751
 and $
15,618
 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively,
and expense of $
107,989
 and $
41,761
 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These costs are included in Sales and
marketing on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Post-Retirement Benefits:

We have one 401(k) Savings
Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this 401(k) Plan, matching
contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized expense of
$
68,363
 and $
70,376
 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $
119,171
 and $
143,486
 for the six months ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Airobotics’ post-employment
benefits are usually funded by deposits with insurance companies and are classified as defined deposit plans or defined benefit plans.
Airobotics’ has defined deposit plans, in accordance with Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law, 1963, according to which
Airobotics regularly makes its payments without having a legal or implied obligation to make additional payments even if the fund has
not accumulated sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits, in the current period and in previous periods. Deposits to a defined
benefit plan for severance pay or benefits, are recognized as an expense when deposited with the plan in parallel with receiving work
services from the employee. All of Airobotics’ employees in Israel are subject to Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law.
We recognized expense of $
307,810
 and $
186,915
 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $
566,813
 and $
372,498

for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to these post-employment benefits.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from
product sales, services, and development arrangements. We determine revenue recognition in accordance with 
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to
determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the products or services it transfers to the customer.

Ondas has two business segments
that generate revenue: Ondas Networks and OAS. Ondas Networks is engaged in the development, marketing, and sale of wireless radio systems
for secure, wide area mission-critical, business-to-business networks. Ondas Networks generates revenue primarily from the sale of our
FullMAX System and the delivery of related services, along with non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) development projects with
certain customers. OAS generates revenue through the sales of their Optimus System™, the Iron Drone Raider™, and separately
priced support, maintenance and ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Optimus System™ and the Iron Drone Raider™.

Product Sales Revenue

Product revenue is generally
recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery
based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract, or upon installation when the combined performance obligation is not distinct within
the context of the contract.

Ondas Networks’ software
and hardware, and OAS’ Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™, are sold with a limited one-year basic warranty included
in the price. The limited one-year basic warranty is an assurance-type warranty, is not a separate performance obligation, and thus no
transaction price is allocated to it. The nature of tasks under the limited one-year basic warranty only provides for remedying defective
product(s) covered by the warranty.

Service and Subscription Revenue

Service revenue is comprised
of separately priced support and maintenance sales, as well as ancillary services, directly related to product sales, including product
training, installation, and onsite support. Ancillary service revenues are recognized at the point in time when those services have been
provided to the customer and the performance obligation has been satisfied. The Company allocates the transaction price to the service
based on the stand-alone selling prices of these performance obligations which are stated in our contracts.

OAS also generates service
revenue by selling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems. The customer
pays for a monthly, annual, or multi-annual subscription service to remotely access the data collected by their autonomous systems. Data
subscription service revenue is recognized on straight line basis over the length of the customer subscription agreement. If a subscription
payment is received prior to installation and operation of their autonomous systems, it is held in deferred revenue and recognized after
operation commences over the length of the subscription service.

Development Revenue

Development revenue is comprised
primarily of non-recurring engineering service contracts to develop software and hardware applications for various customers. For Ondas
Networks, in 2025 and 2024, a significant portion of this revenue is generated from one parent customer whereby Ondas Networks is to develop
such applications to interoperate within the customers infrastructure. For these contracts, Ondas Networks and the customers work cooperatively,
whereby the customers’ involvement is to provide technical specifications for the product design, as well as to review and approve
the project progress at various markers based on predetermined milestones. The products developed are not able to be sold to any other
customer and are based in part upon existing Ondas Networks and customer technology. Development revenue is typically recognized over
time using a percentage of completion input method, whereby revenues are recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of satisfaction
of the performance obligation based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. The input method is utilized because
management considers it to be the best available measure of progress as the performance obligations are completed.

14

Revenue and cost estimates
are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of revenue and cost of revenue
are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current
and prior periods based on the performance completed to date.

Payment Terms

Ondas Networks’ payment
terms are Net 30 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. OAS’s payment terms vary and range
from Net 30 days to Net 60 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. Payment terms for the majority
of development related revenue carry milestone-related payment obligations which span the contract life. For milestone-based development
contracts, the customer reviews the completed milestone and once approved, makes payment pursuant to the applicable contract.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain
more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.
We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements
indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We allocate the total transaction price
to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar
circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price considering available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance
obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.

Contract Modification

Contracts that are modified
to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements are assessed to determine if the modification either creates new or
changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, contract modifications are for products or services that are not distinct
from the existing contract due to the inability to use, consume or sell the products or services on their own to generate economic benefits
and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and
measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase
in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, there were no modifications
to contract specifications.

Contract Assets and Liabilities

We recognize a receivable or contract
asset when we perform a service or transfer a good in advance of receiving consideration. A receivable is recorded when our right to consideration
is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. A contract asset is recorded when
we have recognized revenue over time in accordance with meeting our performance obligation but are unable to invoice the customer yet
based on the contractual invoicing terms. The contract asset is reclassified to a receivable when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
Contract assets are recorded at gross revenue recognized less an allowance for credit losses (see Accounts Receivable above). 
The table
below details the activity in our contract assets during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024. Contract
assets are included in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Warranty Reserve

For our software and hardware
products, we provide a limited one-year assurance-type warranty and for our development service, we provide no warranties. The assurance-type
warranty covers defects in material and workmanship only. If a software or hardware component is determined to be defective after being
tested by the Company within the one-year, the Company will repair, replace or refund the price of the covered hardware and/or software
to the customer (not including any shipping, handling, delivery or installation charges). We estimate, based upon a review of historical
warranty claim experience, the costs that may be incurred under our warranties and record a liability in the amount of such estimate at
the time a product is sold. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates
of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the accrual
as claims data and historical experience warrants. The Company has assessed the costs of fulfilling its existing assurance-type warranties
and has determined that the estimated outstanding warranty obligation on June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 are immaterial to the Company’s
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Leases

Under Topic 842, operating
lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s operating leases consisted
of office spaces in Sunnyvale, CA (the “Oakmead Lease”), Sparks, MD, Waltham, MA (the “Waltham Lease”), and Petah

% through December 31, 2028.

On January 23, 2023, the Company
acquired Airobotics and the Airobotics Leases, which includes office space in Petah Tikva, Israel leased according to three different
lease agreements. These agreements are with respect to different sections of the entire leased area and were in effect through December
31, 2023, February 28, 2024, and November 30, 2024 wherein the base rate of the entire leased area was approximately $
20,500
 per month.
The expired leases were being accounted for on a month-to-month basis. On May 22, 2025, Airobotics entered into a new operating lease
agreement for the office space in Petah Tikva, Israel effective through April 30, 2029, wherein base rent is approximately $
22,000
 per
month. 

On November 25, 2024, Airobotics
entered into a 24-month lease agreement with the owner and landlord of office space in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (the “Dubai Office
Lease”). The Dubai Office Lease commenced on December 1, 2024, and is an operating lease through December 2, 2026. Base rent for
the full lease term is $
272,262
, which was paid in full in December 2024.

We determine if an arrangement
is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. If we determine that the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease,
at lease inception, we then determine whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in
recording a right of use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right
to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the
lease term. For purposes of calculating operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, we use the non-cancellable lease term
plus options to extend that we are reasonably certain to take. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate based
on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. This rate is generally consistent
with the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our credit facilities, as this rate approximates our collateralized borrowing capabilities
over a similar term of the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term
(12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying assets. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for any
class of underlying asset.

non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the years ending December 31, 2025, 2026 - 2028, and 2029 of $

respectively, are not included in the table above.

Net Loss Per Common Share

Basic net loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding for each period (the denominator). Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting the dividends accumulated
for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from net income.

The computation of diluted
net loss per share is similar to the computation of basic net loss per share except that the numerator may have to adjust for any dividends
and income or loss associated with potentially dilutive securities that are assumed to have resulted in the issuance of shares of Common
Stock, and the denominator may have to adjust to include the number of additional shares of Common Stock that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential shares of Common Stock had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur
from shares of Common Stock issuable through stock options, warrants, restricted stock units, or convertible preferred stock. For purposes
of determining diluted earnings per common share, the treasury stock method is used for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock
units, and the if-converted method is used for convertible preferred stock as prescribed in ASC Topic 260. Because of the net loss for
the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the impact of including this in our computation of diluted net loss per share was anti-dilutive.

19

The following potentially
dilutive securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss
per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited number
of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution may be in excess of FDIC insurance limits. As of June 30,
2025, the Company was $
66,418,510
 in excess of FDIC insured limits.

Credit is extended to customers
based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support
accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for credit losses.

Concentration of Customers

Because we have only recently
invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our
revenue. Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was composed of three customers accounting
for 
50
%, 
27
% and 
19
% of the Company’s revenue for the three month period ended June 30, 2025, respectively. Revenue from significant
customers was composed of three customers accounting for 
31
%, 
30
% and 
28
% of the Company’s revenue for the six month period ended
June 30, 2025, respectively. Revenue was composed of three customers accounting for 
67
%, 
13
% and 
13
% of the Company’s revenue for
the three month period ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Revenue from significant customers was composed of three customers accounting
for 
60
%, 
15
% and 
15
% of the Company’s revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

Accounts receivable from significant
customers, those representing 10% or more of the total accounts receivable, were composed of three customers accounting for 
32
%, 
31
%,
and 
29
%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2025. Two customers accounted for 
78
% and 
10
%,
respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2024.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-08, “Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets”, which amends and enhances the disclosure requirements
for crypto assets. The new requirements will be effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this pronouncement as of January 1, 2025 had no impact on our accompanying
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company has no crypto assets.

20

In November 2024, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments”.
The amendments in ASU No. 2024-04 clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments
should be accounted for as an induced conversion, applicable only to conversions that include the issuance of all equity securities issuable
pursuant to the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the debt at issuance, and make additional clarifications to assist stakeholders
in applying the guidance. For all entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of this pronouncement as of January 1, 2025
had no impact on our accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company’s convertible debt instruments’
conversion privileges were not changed to induce conversion.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In October 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-06, which incorporates 14 of the 27 disclosures referred to by the SEC in their SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure
Update and Simplification, issued on August 17, 2018. The amendments in this ASU modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of
a variety of Topics in the Codification and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected Topics unless otherwise indicated.
The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively. For public business entities, the effective date for each amendment will be
the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early
adoption prohibited. The Company has evaluated the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-03, and it is not expected to have an impact
on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires companies to provide disaggregated information
about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new requirements will
be effective for public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2024, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic
220-40)”. The amendments in ASU No. 2024-03 require disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about
certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity: 1. Disclose the amounts
of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion,
and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas-producing activities (DD&A) (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in
each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing
operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (a)–(e). 2. Include certain amounts that are already required to
be disclosed under U.S. GAAP in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements. 3. Disclose a qualitative description of
the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. 4. Disclose the total amount
of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. For all public business entities,
the amendments in ASU No. 2024-03 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, which clarified
the above effective dates for ASU No. 2024-03. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2025, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2025-03, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) and Consolidation (Topic 810): Determining the Accounting Acquirer in the Acquisition
of a Variable Interest Entity”, which require an entity involved in an acquisition transaction effected primarily by exchanging
equity interests when the legal acquiree is a variable interest entity (VIE) that meets the definition of a business to consider the factors
in paragraphs 805-10-55-12 through 55-15 to determine which entity is the accounting acquirer. The amendments in ASU No. 2025-03 replace
the requirement that the primary beneficiary always is the acquirer with an assessment that requires an entity to consider the factors
to determine which entity is the accounting acquirer. The amendments in ASU No. 2025-03 are effective for all entities for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard
on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

21

In July 2025, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2025-05, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and
Contract Assets”, which provides all entities, including public business entities, with a practical expedient, which allows the
entity to assume that current conditions as of the balance sheet date do not change for the remaining life of the asset when developing
reasonable and supportable forecasts as part of estimating expected credit losses. The amendments in ASU No. 2025-05 should be applied
prospectively and are effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting
periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted in both interim and annual reporting periods in which financial
statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard
on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 7 – NOTES PAYABLE

2017 Convertible Promissory Note

On September 14, 2017, the
Company and an individual entered into a convertible promissory note with unilateral conversion preferences by the individual (the “2017
Convertible Promissory Note”). On July 11, 2018, the Company’s Board approved certain changes to the 2017 Convertible Promissory
Note wherein the conversion feature was changed from unilateral to mutual between the individual and the Company. 

The Company may at any time
on or after a qualified public offering convert any unpaid repayment at the IPO conversion price. The conversion price is the lesser of
the (i) price per share of Common Stock sold in the Qualified Public Offering, discounted by 
20
%, and (ii) the price per share of Common
Stock based on a pre-money Company valuation of $
50
 million on a Fully Diluted Basis.

As of June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the total outstanding balance of the 2017 Convertible Promissory Note was $
300,000
. The maturity date of the 2017 Convertible
Promissory Note is based on the payment of 
0.6
% of quarterly gross revenue until 1.5 times the amount of the 2017 Convertible Promissory
Note is paid. Accrued interest on June 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024 was $
19,848
 and $
20,041
, respectively. Interest expense for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was $ 
3,750
 and $
7,500
, respectively. Interest expense for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2024 was $
3,750
 and $
7,500
, respectively.

2022 Convertible Exchange Notes

On
October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain investors
pursuant to which we issued convertible notes (“2022 Convertible Promissory Notes”) in the principal amount of $
34.5
 million,
with a debt discount of $
4.5
 million and issuance costs of $
2.3
 million. The net amount of proceeds to us from the 2022 Convertible Promissory
Notes after deducting the placement agent’s fees and transaction expenses (issuance costs) were approximately $
27,703,000
. The Company
has used the net proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes for general corporate purposes, including funding capital, expenditures,
or the expansion of its business and providing working capital.

On
January 20, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement (“Amended SPA”). The Amended SPA amends
the notes as described below and was accounted for as a modification of the Purchase Agreement.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Amended SPA, on January 20, 2023, the Company exchanged the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, into 
3
% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2024 (the “2022 Convertible Exchange Notes”).

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, except that they (i)
are issued pursuant to the Base Indenture (as defined below) and the First Supplemental Indenture (as defined below); (ii) have a maturity
date of October 28, 2024; (iii) allow for the Acceleration of Installment Amounts (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes)
not to exceed eight (8) times the Installment Amount (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes) with respect to the Installment
Date (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes) related to the Current Acceleration (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange
Notes); and (iv) modify the Acceleration Conversion Price (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes).

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes were issued pursuant to the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”),
dated as of January 20, 2023, between the Company and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The
First Supplemental Indenture supplements the indenture entered into by and between the Company and the Trustee, dated as of January 20,
2023 (the “Base Indenture” and, together with the First Supplemental Indenture, the “Initial Indenture”). The
Initial Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the terms of the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes include
those set forth in the Initial Indenture and those made part of the Initial Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.

24

On July 21, 2023, the Company
entered into an agreement and waiver with the holder of the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes (the “Agreement and Waiver,” together
with the Purchase Agreement and Amended SPA, the “SPA”) that included (i) extending the Maturity Date to from October 28,
2024 to April 28, 2025; (ii) waive the last sentence of Section 8(e) of the Notes (such that last sentence of Section 8(e) of the Notes
shall have no further force and effect) (the “Acceleration Waiver”); (iii) reduce the Conversion Price of the 2022 Convertible
Exchange Notes to the lower of (A) the Conversion Price then in effect and (B) the greater of (x) the Floor Price (as defined in the Notes)
then in effect and (y) 
125
% of the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Common Stock during the five (5) consecutive
Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date; provided, that, in addition, during the
period commencing on the effective date through and including September 30, 2023, the conversion price of the Notes, solely with respect
to voluntary conversions of such aggregate Conversion Amount of the Notes not in excess of such aggregate Current Installment Amounts
of such applicable period (or otherwise eligible to be converted in one or more Accelerations during such applicable period), shall be
further lowered to the Installment Conversion Price (as defined in the Existing Note) in effect for the Installment Date (as defined in
the Existing Note) of the Existing Note of July 3, 2023; (iv) to extend the Additional Closing Expiration Date to April 28, 2026; and
(v) increase the aggregate principal amount of Notes issuable in one or more Additional Closings to $
46,000,000
. This agreement was
accounted for as a modification.

The
2022 Convertible Exchange Notes bear interest at the rate of 
3
% per annum. The 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes are payable in monthly
installments beginning on November 1, 2022 through the maturity date of 
April 28, 2025
 (each such date, an “Installment Date”).
On each Installment Date, we will make monthly payments by converting the applicable “Installment Amount” (as defined below)
into shares of our Common Stock (an “Installment Conversion”), subject to satisfaction of certain equity conditions, including
a minimum $
1.50
 share price, $
500,000
 minimum daily volume, and maintaining continued Nasdaq listing requirements among other conditions.
If these conditions are not met, installments can be requested in cash. For the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we made 
no
 cash
payments, and we issued 
8,956,644
 and 
340,855
 common shares as a result of Installment Conversion, respectively. At each Installment Date
the note holder may defer some or all of the amount due until the subsequent Installment Date. In between Installment Dates, the note
holder also has the option to accelerate certain portions of principal due. At each Installment Date the price used to exchange outstanding
notes into Common Stock is based on the lower of (A) 
92
% of the lowest VWAP of the respective previous five trading days; and (B) the
Floor Price ($
0.32
 as of December 31, 2024). The maximum conversion price is $
1.50
 per share.

The
“Installment Amount” will equal:

(i)

for all Installment Dates other than the maturity date, the lesser of (x) the Holder Pro Rata Amount of $
1,437,500
 and (y) the principal amount then outstanding under the Note; and

(ii)

on the maturity date, the principal amount then outstanding under the Note.

Each
month, the note holders may accelerate a portion of the note due up to eight times the minimum Installment Amount of $
1,437,500
.

As
of June 30, 2025, the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes have been repaid in full, and the remaining unamortized debt discount and issuance
costs of $
33,863
 was taken to additional paid in capital.

2023 Additional Notes

On July 24, 2023, pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, as amended, an Investor elected to purchase 
3
% Series B-2 Senior Convertible Notes in the aggregate
original principal amount of $
11.5
 million (the “2023 Additional Notes”), which 2023 Additional Notes are convertible into
shares of Common Stock under certain conditions more fully described in the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes discussed above. The 2023
Additional Notes have an original issue discount of approximately thirteen percent (
13
%) resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of
$
10.0

Warrants to Purchase Common Stock of the Company

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton
option model (the “Black-Scholes Model”) to determine the fair value of warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company.
The Black-Scholes Model is an acceptable model in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions
including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average term of the warrant.

The risk-free interest rate
assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term
of the warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the
expected life of the award. Our estimated volatility is an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were
publicly available over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. We used the historical volatility of peer entities due to the
lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price.

Offering. Also, pursuant to the Networks Agreement, the Networks Purchasers became parties to those certain investors’ rights agreement,
right of first refusal agreement, and voting agreement, dated July 21, 2023.

Ondas Networks used the proceeds
from the sale of the Networks Offering Securities to immediately redeem an amount of shares of Networks Common Stock at the Per Share
Price held by the Company that was equivalent to the amount of proceeds raised in the sale of the Networks Offering Securities.

The issuance of the Networks
Offering Securities was exempt from registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of such Securities Act and
Regulation D promulgated thereunder based upon the representations of each of the Networks Purchasers that it was an “accredited
investor” (as defined under Rule 501 of Regulation D) and that it was purchasing such securities without a present view toward a
distribution of the securities. In addition, there was no general advertisement conducted in connection with the sale of the Networks
Offering Securities. See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 for further details.

The Company assessed the Networks
Series A-2 Preferred Stock in accordance with ASC 480 and determined that it should be recorded as temporary equity and not as a liability.
The initial valuation was assigned to the Networks Series A-2 Preferred Stock and the Warrants based on relative fair values, with the
initial valuation of the noncontrolling interest being $
3,028,806
 and warrants being $
1,471,194
. It is being accreted using the effective
interest rate method over the five-year period to achieve the redemption value of $
4,500,000
 plus accrued dividends.

The Company recorded accrued
dividends of $
780,000
 and accretion of $
1,695,607
 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, in aggregate. The Company recorded accrued dividends
of $
724,138
 and accretion of $
1,357,140
 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, in aggregate.

NOTE 10 – SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined
as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision
Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. 
The Company’s CODM is its

Chief Executive Officer
. Segment operating loss and segment loss before provision for income taxes are the measures of profit and loss
used by the CODM to assess performance and to decide how to allocate resources for each of the Company’s reportable segments.
 Segment
operating loss and segment loss before provision for income taxes are used to monitor actual results versus planned and prior period results
for each segment based on their respective profitability objectives and business models. Segment operating loss and segment loss before
provision for income taxes are also used to allocate human and capital resources among the reportable segments. The Company determined
it has 
two
 reportable segments, Ondas Networks and OAS, as the CODM reviews financial information for these two businesses separately.

The Company has no inter-segment sales. The Company’s revenue and significant expenses by segment regularly reviewed by the CODM,
and other segment items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows:

NOTE 11 – INCOME TAXES

The Company had a net deferred
tax asset of $
77.5
 million as of December 31, 2024, including a tax benefit of $
69.4
 million from net operating loss carry-forwards. A
valuation allowance of $
77.5
 million was provided against this asset resulting in deferred assets, net of valuation allowance of 
$0
. 

As of December 31, 2024, the
Company and Ondas Networks, respectively, had Federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $
1
 million
and $
15
 million generated in 2007 to 2017 which will begin to expire in 2027 through 2037. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the
Company and Ondas Networks had Federal NOLs of $
73
 million and $
59
 million, respectively, generated in 2018 through 2024 that have no
expiration. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and Ondas Networks had State NOLs available to offset future taxable income of $
49
 million
and $
93
 million, respectively, expiring from 2038 through 2044. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and Ondas Networks had approximately

$0
 and $
752,000
, respectively, of Federal research and development credits available to offset future tax liability expiring from 2038
through 2040. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
134
 million and $
127
 million of Israeli NOL’s. The Company’s
Federal income tax returns for the 2021 to 2023 tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Upon utilization of Federal NOLs in the
future, the IRS may examine records from the year the loss occurred, even if outside the three-year statute of limitations. The Company’s
State tax returns also remain open to examination. The Company’s Israeli income tax returns for the 2020 to 2023 tax years remain
open to examination.

In assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, including the NOLs, the Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient
future taxable income will be generated to utilize its existing deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period when those temporary differences become deductible. Based on
its assessment, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as their future utilization remains
uncertain at this time.

In accordance with Section
382 of the Internal Revenue code, the usage of the Company’s Federal Carryforwards could be limited in the event of a change in
ownership. As of December 31, 2021, the Company completed an analysis and determined that there were multiple ownership changes. Provided
sufficient taxable income is generated the annual base limitation plus increased limitation calculated pursuant to IRS Notice 2003-65
will allow the Company to utilize all existing losses within the carryover periods.

The Company applies the FASB’s
provisions for uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes the two-step process to determine the amount of recognized tax benefit. For
tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.

As of June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions that would require it to measure and reflect
the potential lack of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate its uncertain
tax positions in future periods to determine if measurement and recognition in its financial statements is necessary. The Company does
not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next year.

NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

We may be involved in legal
proceedings, claims and assessments arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes
are not predictable with assurance. There are no such loss contingencies that are included in the financial statements as of June 30,
2025.

On October 27, 2023, the Company
reached a settlement agreement for legal proceedings related to Ardenna in which the Company is entitled to receive $
600,000
 in reimbursements
for legal fees related to the proceedings. As of June 30, 2025, the Company received $
550,000
 from the settlement agreement, of which

$0
 and $
450,000
 is recorded in General and administrative expense on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

On June 6, 2024, Airobotics
filed a Notice of Non-Payment with the Abu Dhabi Civil Courts in connection with a customer’s lack of payment relating to a purchase
order and breach of a settlement agreement in relation to such purchase order. A performance order was filed on July 11, 2024, and rejected
on July 17, 2024 by the Abu Dhabi Civil Courts. On July 30, 2024, Airobotics appealed the rejection of the performance order. On August
28, 2024, the Abu Dhabi Civil Court of Appeals accepted the appeal and appointed an expert to review the case. On October 9, 2024, the
Abu Dhabi Civil Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Airobotics for the full amount of the initial purchase order less amounts paid to date
by the customer (without taking into consideration the terms of the settlement agreement breached by the customer), which resulted in
a total award of $
2,138,945
 plus interest and expenses. On June 17, 2025, we entered into a second settlement agreement whereby we waived
the outstanding balance due to the Company in exchange for return of the inventory, which is in process.

War in Israel

On October 7, 2023, the State
of Israel, where Airobotics’ main offices and facilities are located, suffered a surprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza
Strip, which led to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring a state of war in Israel. This military operation and related
activities are on-going as of the date of this filing.

The Company is closely monitoring
how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to
support future operations, including the Company’s ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™
and to ship them outside of Israel. Although there have been disruptions in our business and operations, the Company has determined that
there have not been any materially adverse effects on its business or operations. The Company does not believe the disruptions in its
business and operations will have an enduring impact on its business and operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any
future escalation or change could result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company’s Israeli office to support
the Company’s activities. The Company does not have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.

NOTE 13 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As of June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the Company owed $
0
 and $
12,500
 to independent directors, respectively, related to accrued compensation, which is included in
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and
analysis provide information which our management believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations
and financial condition of Ondas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas Holdings,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”).
This discussion should be read together with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes included therein,
which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Report”). This information should also be read in conjunction
with the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) on March 12, 2025, including the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included therein
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K”). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. For a description of factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements, please refer to the below section of this Report titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.” The reported results will not necessarily reflect future results of operations or financial condition.

Overview

Ondas Holdings is a leading
provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc., a Texas corporation (“Ondas
Networks”), Ondas Autonomous Systems Inc., a Nevada corporation (“OAS”), which wholly-owns Airobotics Ltd., an Israeli
company (“Airobotics”), and American Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“American Robotics”).

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics and American Robotics. Ondas
Networks and OAS together provide users in defense, homeland security, and critical infrastructure markets with improved connectivity,
data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks and OAS as separate
business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment. See Note 1, Note 2, and Note 10 of the accompanying unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments.

Ondas Networks Segment

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the
Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT
applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time
connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required
in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drone operations, oil and gas, and public safety,
homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and
ensure a high degree of safety and security. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16
standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we
continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets.

We design, develop, manufacture,
sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio platform for secure, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers
install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. By upgrading their legacy systems,
customers benefit from significant increases in data throughput which enables new applications. We have targeted the North American freight
rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications systems
utilizing dated narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity
and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. The freight rail operators through the
Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), its advisory subsidiary MxV Rail, as well as the American Railway Engineering and
Maintenance Association, have adopted the IEEE 802.16 standard for future private wireless networks. The IEEE 802.16t Direct Peer-to-Peer
protocol has been selected by the AAR as the new standard for Next Generation head-of-train / end-of-train (“HOT-EOT”) communications
or “NGHE Gen4.” This new protocol for train telemetry operations enables new safety and operational improvements to existing
HOT-EOT applications.

44

Our software-based FullMAX
platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet
Protocol-based communications to provide security, more reliability and significant data throughput for our mission-critical infrastructure
customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy
serial and analog based protocols no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent
networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications
over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial
networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth.

Industry Partnerships

Ondas Networks continues to
develop partnerships in the rail space to develop and market wireless communications products and services based on Ondas Networks’
technology. Our partnership with Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”) is geared to market our FullMAX-based networking technology
and services and to jointly develop certain wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’
Advanced Train Control System protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform. We are working with other industry partners to commercialize our
platform technologies for specific use cases and to drive broad industry adoption of dot16 applications.

OAS Segment

Our OAS business unit develops
and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises.
Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially
available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing
and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.

Our unique, fully autonomous
platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business
focuses on end-user entities in defense, homeland security, public safety, smart city, airport authorities, and other governmental entities
together with commercial operators of critical industrial and technology facilities such as oil & gas, seaports, mining, and heavy
construction as well as for data centers and semiconductor fabs. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-time aerial data
capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and
field area operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful
implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance,
handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.

Our portfolio companies, American
Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace
business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing
all the challenges arising along these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and
ongoing support.

OAS and its portfolio companies
have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification
(“TC”) from the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming
the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification,
streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance
of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace
System thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving FAA
TC will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market
and worldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically
transform critical operations with our cutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.

War in Israel

On October 7, 2023, the State
of Israel, where Airobotics’ main offices and facilities are located, suffered a surprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza
Strip, which led to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring a state of war in Israel. This military operation and related
activities are on-going as of the date of this filing.

The Company is closely monitoring
how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to
support future operations, including the Company’s ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™
and to ship them outside of Israel. Although there have been disruptions in our business and operations, the Company has determined that
there have not been any materially adverse effects on its business or operations. The Company does not believe the disruptions in its
business and operations will have an enduring impact on its business and operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any
future escalation or change could result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company’s Israeli office to support
the Company’s activities. The Company does not have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.

Our revenues increased by
$5,315,537 to $6,273,388 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $957,851 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Revenues
during the three months ended June 30, 2025, included $3,605,020 for products, $2,495,927 for service and subscriptions, and $172,441
for development agreements, primarily with Siemens. Revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2024, included $22,484 for products,
$298,553 for service and subscriptions, and $636,814 for development agreements, primarily with Siemens. The increase in our revenues
were primarily the result of approximately $3,583,000 in increased product sales and approximately $2,197,000 in increased service and
subscription revenue, primarily due to OAS having multi-drone sales with associated services in the three months ended June 30, 2025,
but no comparable sales in the three months ended June 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately
$464,000 in development revenue, primarily with Siemens, as further orders have been delayed by the railroads as they work on implementing
the 900 MHz band network.

at Ondas Networks who was paying two office leases during the three months ending June 30, 2024 as compared to one lease during the three
months ended June 30, 2025 and a reimbursement of approximately $90,000 for common area charges under Ondas Networks’ current office
lease. Approximately $58,000 relates to a reduction in the Company’s D&O, E&O and general liability insurance expense,
and approximately $57,000 relates to a reduction in freight expenses and general office purchases;

48

(v)
An
increase of approximately $140,000 in depreciation and amortization related to additional purchases of equipment in the second half of
2024 and first half of 2025; and

(vi)
An
increase of approximately $806,000 in other research and development costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment, of
which an increase of approximately $1,205,000 occurred at OAS related to an increase of approximately $470,000 in use of third-party

Our revenues increased by

during the six months ended June 30, 2025, included $6,828,993 for products, $3,304,768 for service and subscriptions, and $387,809 for
development agreements, primarily with Siemens. Revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024, included $24,758 for products, $608,140
for service and subscriptions, and $949,962 for development agreements, primarily with Siemens. The increase in our revenues were primarily
the result of approximately $6,804,000 in increased product sales and approximately $2,697,000 in increased service and subscription revenue
primarily due to OAS having multi-drone orders in the six months ended June 30, 2025, but no comparable sales in the six months ended
June 30, 2024. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $562,000 in development revenue, primarily to Siemens, during
the three months ended June 30, 2025, as further orders have been delayed by the railroads as they work on implementing the 900 MHz band
network.

increase in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of increased revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2024. Cost of goods sold at OAS did not increase in the same ratio as revenue due to the increase in product
revenue at OAS, which included sales of our Iron Drone Raider™, which has higher margins compared to service and non-recurring engineering
development revenue recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

$

The increase in operating
expenses was primarily due to:

(i)
An
increase of approximately $6,487,000 in human resource costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation at the Company of approximately
$2,784,000 for new stock options and RSUs granted during the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of approximately $1,434,000
related to an increase in taxable fringe benefit expense, for tax on employee benefits such as Company subsidized vehicles, meals, and
other expenses, at OAS primarily as the result of an audit by the Israeli government for previous years, an increase of approximately
$475,000 in salary and benefit expense related to an increase in headcount and bonus expense in our general and administration department,
an increase of approximately $880,000 in salary and benefit expense related to an increase in headcount and bonus expense in our research
and development department, an increase of approximately $914,000 in salary and benefit expense related to an increase in headcount and
bonus expense in our sales and marketing department, as we work on improving sales;

(ii)
An
increase of approximately $184,000 in travel and entertainment, primarily related to increased travel for sales and product demonstration opportunities
and increased trade show attendance;

(iii)
An
increase of approximately $813,000 in professional fees and consulting expenses, of which an increase of approximately $906,000 relates
to legal and accounting fee costs, primarily related to the $450,000 recovery of legal fees from the settlement agreement for legal proceedings
related to Ardenna, which reduced our legal fee expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of approximately $231,000
in  legal fee costs associated with debt repayments, the shelf registration, and other corporate matters, and an increase of approximately
$225,000 related to increased use of accounting consultants and increased audit fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
of approximately $93,000 in other third-party contractors and consultants;

(iv)
A
decrease of approximately $854,000 in other expense, of which approximately $747,000 relates to reduced rent and facilities charges primarily
at Ondas Networks who was paying two office leases during the six months ending June 30, 2024 as compared to one lease during the six
months ended June 30, 2025 and a reduction in common area shared expenses under their new lease, approximately $83,000 relates to a reduction
in the Company’s D&O, E&O and general liability insurance expense, and approximately $24,000 relates to a reduction in
freight expenses and general office purchases;

52

(v)
An
increase of approximately $184,000 in depreciation and amortization related to additional purchases of equipment in the second half of
2024 and first half of 2025;

(vi)
A
increase of approximately $355,000 in other research and development costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment, of
which an increase of approximately $1,376,000 occurred at OAS related to an increase of approximately $784,000 in use of third-party
contractor and consultants, development and software expenses as we invest in improving our current product line, and a one-time settlement
of approximately $592,000 for of all amounts due to a vendor under previous development and manufacturing agreements, which reduced other
research and development costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment, during the six months ended June 30, 2024. This
increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $1,021,000 at Ondas Networks primarily related to a decrease in use of third-party
research and development contractors and consultants.

(vii)
An
increase of approximately $367,000 in other sales and marketing costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment, of which
approximately $254,000 relates to an increase in use of sales and marketing third-party contractors and consultants, approximately $59,000
relates to increased attendance at trade shows and other marketing events, and approximately $54,000 relates to increased equipment purchases
and costs association with demonstrations.

The principal use of cash
in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2025, was to fund the Company’s current expenses primarily related to
operating activities necessary to allow us to service and support customers.

The decrease in cash flows
used in operating activities of approximately $1,212,000 was primarily due to an increase in net loss of approximately $6,741,000, of
which approximately $7,634,000 related to non-cash and credits, including depreciation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs,
amortization of intangibles assets, amortization of right of use asset, change in fair value of government grant liability, and stock-based
compensation, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a cash inflow of approximately $319,000.

The decrease in cash flows
used in investing activities of approximately $2,009,000 primarily relates to a decrease in purchases of equipment in the six months ended
June 30, 2025.

The increase in cash flows
provided by financing activities of approximately $45,378,000 primarily relates to the net proceeds of approximately $42,677,000 received
from 2025 Public Offering during the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the net proceeds received from the sale of Common Stock
in the Company of approximately of $3,859,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2024, combined with the increase in proceeds from the
exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $9,954,000, increase in net proceeds of approximately $923,000 from the issuance
of convertible notes payable, and an increase in proceeds, net of repayments, of approximately $58,000 from government grants during the
three months ended June 30, 2025. These increases were partially offset by the sale of preferred stock in Ondas Networks of approximately
$4,375,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. As of June 30, 2025, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $261,254,000. As of June 30, 2025, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $2,406,000 and
short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $17,644,000, net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately $1,125,000, including
accrued interest of approximately $630,000, of which approximately $342,000 is due to related parties. As of June 30, 2025, we had cash
and restricted cash of approximately $68,551,000 and working capital of approximately $59,720,000. We had approximately $15,063,000 of
net cash flows used in operations for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

In 2024, we raised approximately
$36,997,000 of net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Holdings, Ondas Networks, and OAS; approximately $1,422,000 of
net proceeds from issuance of secured notes in Ondas Networks; approximately $7,304,000 of net proceeds from issuing common stock in Ondas
Holdings, warrants in Ondas Holdings, and warrants in OAS; and approximately $4,375,000 in net proceeds from issuing additional redeemable
preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings.

54

As of June 30, 2025, we raised
approximately $42,677,000 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from a registered public offering, $9,963,000 from the exercise of stock
options and warrants in Ondas Holdings, $923,000 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from issuance of convertible notes in Ondas Networks,
and $365,000 in Israeli government grants to Airobotics. Subsequent to June 30, 2025, the Company issued 6,950,574 shares as a result
of Installment Conversions on the 2024 Additional Notes, repaying the 2024 Additional Notes in full. As of July 18, 2025, the 2022 Convertible
Promissory Notes, 2023 Additional Notes, and 2024 Additional Notes have been repaid in full.

In the Company’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-Q as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025, management
concluded that substantial doubt existed about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring operating losses
and limited liquidity resources.

During the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company raised approximately
$42,677,000 in proceeds, net of issuance costs, from a registered public offering, and approximately $8,979,000 from the exercise of stock
options and warrants in Ondas Holdings. Management believes these actions sufficiently alleviate the previously identified conditions
that raised substantial doubt, and the Company will have sufficient capital resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months
from the date these interim financial statements are issued.

As of August 12, 2025, management
has concluded that substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists as of the issuance
date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of June 30, 2025, gross
profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued
and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable,
lines of credit or other sources.

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We also
will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research
and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and
cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional
notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable
terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to
fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or
limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of June 30, 2025, we had
no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management’s discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable at the time and under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
Information concerning our critical accounting policies with respect to these items is available in Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no significant
changes in our critical accounting policies since the filing of the 2024 Form 10-K.

55

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There have been no material
changes to our significant accounting policies as summarized in Note 2 of our 2024 Form 10-K. We do not expect that the adoption of any
recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Report, as well as information
included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain statements that constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can
be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
“plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely
result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.
These forward-looking statements are based on our current, reasonable expectations and assumptions, which expectations and assumptions
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our 2024 Form
10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 12, 2025. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required
by law.  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide information under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management,
with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of June 30, 2025. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of June 30, 2025.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs.

56

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are not currently
involved in any legal proceeding or investigation by a governmental agency that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or operating results.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our business, financial condition,
operating results, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
on March 12, 2025 (the “2024 Form 10-K”), the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual
results.

There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously
disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K and in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025.
