Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company leading a new era in the treatment of CNS disorders. We deliver scientific breakthroughs by identifying critical gaps in care and developing differentiated products with a focus on novel mechanisms of action that enable meaningful advancements in patient outcomes. Our CNS portfolio includes multiple FDA-approved products that are being further developed for additional neurological or psychiatric conditions and novel product candidates in late-stage clinical development. In May 2022, we completed the U.S. acquisition of Sunosi from Jazz and in November 2022, we acquired the ex-U.S. assets of Sunosi from Jazz for certain international markets. Sunosi is a product approved by the FDA and marketed in the U.S. to improve wakefulness in adult patients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea, and also approved in Europe in January 2020 by the European Commission. In August 2022, Auvelity
®
 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDD in adults and we initiated the commercial launch of Auvelity in the U.S. in October 2022. In January 2025, Symbravo
®
 was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Refer to Part I, Item 1. “Business” for a summary of our clinical programs.

Since our incorporation in January 2012, our operations to date have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our compounds, engaging in other discovery and preclinical activities, the commercial launches of Auvelity and Sunosi, and preparatory activities for the launch of Symbravo. Subsequent to our IPO, we financed our operations primarily through proceeds from sales of our common stock to equity investors and debt borrowings. For a further discussion, see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.

Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. We have recently begun commercial sales of Auvelity and Sunosi, and plan to commercially launch Symbravo, but we have limited experience with commercializing these, or any, products.

We have incurred significant operating and net losses since inception. We incurred net losses of $287.2 million and $239.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2024 was $1,122.8 million, and we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing operating losses. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, as we continue the commercialization of our on-market products and the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our current product candidates and any other product candidates that we develop or in-license and advance to clinical development. Further, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity, debt financings, or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.

Financial Overview

Revenue

We generated $381.7 million and $202.5 million in net revenue from product sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We expect that Auvelity, Sunosi, and Symbravo revenues are likely to fluctuate based on demand quarter to quarter. We will not generate revenue from other products unless and until we successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue from such product candidates, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially and adversely affected. If we enter into licensing or collaboration arrangements, such agreements may or may not generate revenue in the future.

Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded a milestone revenue of $0.5 million related to an achievement of a regulatory milestone in China for Sunosi from SK. In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded license revenue of $65.7 million related to the Pharmanovia License Agreement (as defined below). See below for more detail.

License Agreement with Pharmanovia

In February 2023, we entered into the Pharmanovia License Agreement with Pharmanovia to commercialize and further develop Sunosi
®
 in the Territory. Pharmanovia is a UK-based global life cycle management healthcare company that focuses on four core therapeutic areas – Oncology, Endocrinology, Neurology and Cardiovascular.

We received an upfront payment of €62.0 million ($65.7 million) during the first quarter of 2023 and are eligible to receive sales-based and other milestone payments totaling up to €94.5 million. We will receive a royalty percentage in the mid-twenties on net sales of the Licensed Products (as defined in the Pharmanovia License Agreement) in the Territory. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized royalty revenue of $3.5 million related to Pharmanovia’s sales of Sunosi.

Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue includes direct costs of formulating, manufacturing, and packaging drug product, overhead costs consisting of labor, customs, stock-based compensation, shipping, outside inventory management, royalty expense, and other miscellaneous operating costs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded a $2.5 million expense for the achievement of a sales-based milestone related to world-wide Sunosi sales. In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a $5.0 million license sharing expense related to the upfront license revenue received.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses primarily include preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing costs, employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, travel, and stock based compensation expense, contract services, including external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, facilities costs, overhead costs, depreciation, and other related costs.

112

Table of Contents

Research and development activities are central to our business model. We have and will incur substantial costs beyond our present and planned clinical trials in order to file an NDA for any of our product candidates. It is difficult to determine with certainty the costs and duration of our current or future clinical trials and preclinical studies, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of Auvelity, Sunosi, and Symbravo or our product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical trials and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate, and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability, and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate’s commercial potential.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, commercial, finance, and operational functions, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are marketing costs, other commercial costs, pre-commercialization costs, facility-related costs, insurance expense, professional fees for legal and accounting services, and patent filing and prosecution costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net, primarily consists of cash interest and non-cash costs related to our term loans (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for a further discussion). We amortize these costs over the term of our debt agreements as interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Interest expense, net also includes interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.

Intangible asset amortization

The intangible asset is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period of benefit of ten years. We evaluate recoverability of the intangible asset periodically by considering events or changes in circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful life or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Fair value in contingent consideration

Consideration paid in a business combination may include potential future payments that are contingent upon the acquired business achieving certain milestones in the future (“contingent consideration”). The royalty payments due to Jazz are a high single-digit royalty on our U.S. net sales of Sunosi in the current indication and a mid single-digit royalty on our U.S. net sales of Sunosi for future indications. Contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during such period a change is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date and reporting periods thereafter using the estimated future cash outflows based on future sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

113

Table of Contents

Management considers many factors in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes, and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. This process may result in actual results differing materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of the financial statements if these results differ from historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such assumptions are reasonable when made.

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from: invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, government rebates, PBMs and Managed Care Organization rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, product returns and costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to Accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available. These reserves reflect our best estimate of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled to based on the terms of the contracts.

We make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenue. Claims by third parties for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. Rebates apply to: Medicaid, managed care, and supplemental rebates to all applicable states as defined by the statutory government pricing calculation requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Tricare rebates to the TRICARE third-party administrator are based on the statutory calculation defined in the agreement with the Defense Health Agency. Part D and Commercial Managed Care rebates are paid based on the contracts with PBMs and Managed Care Organizations. Rebates are paid to these entities upon receipt of an invoice from the contracted entity, which is based on the utilization of the product by the members of the contracted entity We estimate these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related product sales is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales as well as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We will adjust our estimates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available.

License revenue

We generate revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of certain products. Such agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses. Payments made by the customer may include non-refundable upfront fees, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and royalties on sales of products.

114

Table of Contents

If a license to the intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize the transaction price allocated to the license as revenue upon transfer of control of the license. All other promised goods or services in the agreement are evaluated to determine if they are distinct. If they are not distinct, they are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that is distinct. Optional future services where any additional consideration paid to us reflects their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations. If optional future services are priced in a manner which provides the customer with a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights and are accounted for as separate performance obligations.

Contingent milestones at contract inception are estimated to the extent that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received, and, therefore, the variable consideration is constrained. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achieving development or sales-based milestone payments that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and, if necessary, adjust the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue, as well as earnings, in the period of adjustment.

For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments, and a license of intellectual property that is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, revenue is recognized at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Research and development expenses

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our research and development employees, costs incurred to third-party service providers for the conduct of research, preclinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies, product license fees, consulting and other related expenses. We estimate research, preclinical and clinical study expenses based on services performed, pursuant to contracts with third-party research and development organizations that conduct and manage research, preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf. We estimate these expenses based on reviewing contracts, vendor agreements, discussions with internal management personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments associated with licensing agreements to acquire licenses to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future use are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill

Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and therefore not amortized. We test the carrying amounts of goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first evaluate the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment involves consideration of factors including macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry, external cost factors that could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, all of which requires significant judgment. If the qualitative factors determine it is necessary to complete a goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is determined and compared to its carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be recoverable, and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, and a charge is reported in impairment of goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024, we determined that we have one reporting unit. We have not identified any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the existence of potential impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Intangible asset

The intangible asset is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period of benefit of ten years. We evaluate recoverability of the intangible asset periodically by considering events or changes in circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, we assess the undiscounted projected cash flow for the asset and compare this estimated amount to carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the amount equal to the excess carrying amount over fair value. Due to the nature of estimating project cash flows for an asset, there is significant judgment involved in determining the fair value of an intangible asset. We have not identified any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the existence of potential impairment of the intangible asset during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Contingent consideration

Consideration paid in a business combination may include contingent consideration. In connection with the Acquisition, we have obligations to make royalty payments to Jazz in the high single-digits on our U.S. net sales of Sunosi in the current indication and a mid single-digit royalty on our U.S. net sales of Sunosi for future indications. We estimate fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using the probability weighted income approach as of the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during such period a change is recognized. During each reporting period, significant assumptions are required in determining fair value, including estimating the future sales of Sunosi in current and future indications, timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievements, probability of technical and regulatory success rates, and discount rates. Significant judgment is used in assessing the appropriateness of these assumptions as one or more may involve inputs that are not observable in the market. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions may have a material impact on the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities recorded in any given period.

The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is sensitive to the change in discount rates. As of December 31, 2024, if the discount rate increases or decreases by approximately 1%, the fair value of the contingent consideration would range from $91.5 million to $104.5 million. As of December 31, 2024, if the revenue discount rate increases or decreases by approximately 1%, the fair value of the contingent consideration would range from $92.9 million to $102.9 million.

Income taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, we do not believe any material uncertain tax positions are present.

As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $572.1 million and foreign NOL carryforwards of $4.8 million. U.S. federal NOLs amounting to $59.8 million generated before the 2018 tax year will start expiring beginning 2032, and the NOLs of approximately $512.3 million generated in 2018 and later have an indefinite carryforward period.

Utilization of the NOLs may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation for net operating losses incurred before the 2018 tax year may result in expiration before we can use them. We have recorded a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets.

Stock‑based compensation

For issued stock options, we estimate the grant date fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions, including expected volatility of our common stock, the risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the option, the fair value of our common stock, expected dividend yield, and the exercise price. Certain assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes calculation involve a number of variables, uncertainties, and application of management judgment that are inherently subjective. Significant changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately the amount of stock-based compensation expense that is recognized.

We recognize the grant date fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term. For awards only subject to service-based vesting conditions, we elected to recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis.

Royalty and milestone revenue. 
In connection with the February 2023 Pharmanovia License Agreement to commercialize Sunosi in certain ex-U.S. markets, we recognized royalty revenue of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 attributable to Pharmanovia sales of Sunosi in the out-licensed markets. The increase was in line with the increase in unit sales volume of Sunosi in certain ex-U.S. markets. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized milestone revenue of $0.5 million related to an achievement of a regulatory milestone in China for Sunosi from SK.

Cost of revenue. 
Cost of revenue was $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was in line with the increase in sales of Auvelity and Sunosi. Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes a $2.5 million expense for the achievement of a sales-based milestone related to world-wide Sunosi sales. Additionally, cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a $5.0 million license sharing expense related to the Pharmanovia License Agreement.

(*) Other research and development expenses primarily consist of facilities charges, third party consultant costs, costs related to other product candidates, and other unallocated costs.

Research and development expenses increased by $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to the Phase 3 trials for additional indications, including studies in ADHD, MDD, BED, and SWD, for solriamfetol, the advancement of ongoing Phase 3 trials of AXS-05 and AXS-12, higher manufacturing costs for AXS-07 and AXS-14, and higher personnel costs due to organizational growth. Research and development expenses are expected to stabilize at current levels in the near term as certain development programs near completion while new development programs are initiated.

Selling, general and administrative.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $411.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $323.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to greater commercial activities for Auvelity and Sunosi, and higher personnel costs related to organizational growth, including non-cash stock-based compensation. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand marketing, promotional, and advertising costs for Auvelity and Sunosi, launch Symbravo, and to support general administrative needs.

Loss in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. 
The $28.1 million change for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a $48.9 million change for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to changes in significant unobservable inputs, including discount rates, and significant assumptions, including future sales estimates.

Intangible asset amortization
. We amortize the intangible asset, which we recognized as part of the Acquisition, over its useful life of 10 years. Intangible asset amortization was $6.4 million for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Interest expense, net.
 Interest expense, net, was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest expense related to the Loan Agreement and non-cash interest expense on leases, offset by additional interest income from higher interest rates on cash balances.

Table of Contents

Income tax expense. 
We recorded an income tax expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to state taxes that we expect to pay based on minimum tax requirements in various states. We recorded a tax expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to income earned in Malta in relation to the license revenue recognized from the Pharmanovia License Agreement.

Net loss. 
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $287.2 million as compared to $239.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher research and development spend from pre-clinical and ongoing clinical trial expenses, higher selling, general and administrative expenses from commercial activities related to Auvelity and Sunosi, including sales force and marketing spend, and higher personnel costs due to organizational growth, including non-cash stock compensation expense. Additionally, the increase in net loss was impacted by the upfront payment of $65.7 million received from Pharmanovia in the first quarter of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception through December 31, 2024, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from equity offerings, debt borrowings, and proceeds from product sales. See discussion below.

On December 2, 2022, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt securities, and units up to an unlimited amount, which we refer to as the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. It was declared effective by the SEC upon filing. In the future, we may conduct additional offerings of one or more of these securities utilizing the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement in such amounts, prices and terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. At the time any of our securities covered by the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of any such offering.

In December 2019, we entered into a sales agreement, or the December 2019 Sales Agreement, with SVB Securities LLC (now known as Leerink Partners LLC), or Leerink, pursuant to which we may sell up to $80 million in shares of our common stock from time to time through Leerink, acting as our sales agent, in one or more at-the-market offerings utilizing an automatic shelf registration statement we filed with the SEC on December 5, 2019 for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt securities and units up to an unlimited amount, which we refer to as the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement. Leerink is entitled to receive a commission of 3.0% of the gross proceeds for any shares sold under the December 2019 Sales Agreement.

In March 2022, we entered into a sales agreement, or the March 2022 Sales Agreement with Leerink, and filed a prospectus supplement, pursuant to which we may sell up to $200 million in shares of our common stock from time to time through Leerink, acting as our sales agent, in one or more at-the-market offerings utilizing the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement. Leerink is entitled to receive a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds for any shares sold under the March 2022 Sales Agreement. The March 2022 Sales Agreement supersedes the December 2019 Sales Agreement, by and between us and Leerink. We exhausted sales of shares of our common stock under our prior at-the-market offering program.

In August 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement to the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement for the issuance and sale, if any, of up to an additional $250 million in shares of our common stock. Leerink is entitled to receive a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds for any shares sold under the March 2022 Sales Agreement.

In December 2022, in connection with the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement, we filed a new sales agreement prospectus to replace the prior prospectus supplement filed in August 2022 associated with the expired 2019 Shelf Registration Statement. The new sales agreement prospectus covered the issuance and sale by us of up to the same $250 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold from time to time through Leerink, as the sales agent, under the March 2022 Sales Agreement.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we received approximately $40.8 million in gross proceeds through the sale of 466,108 shares, of which net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, under the March 2022 Sales Agreement. We did not utilize the March 2022 Sales Agreement with Leerink during the year ended December 31, 2023.

In January 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement, or the Third Amendment, with Hercules. The Third Amendment increased the size of the Term Loan Advance (as defined in the Loan Agreement) to $350.0 million, reduces the interest rate, and extends the maturity and interest-only period of the Loan Agreement. In September 2024, we entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Loan Agreement, or the Fifth Amendment, with Hercules. The Fifth Amendment amended the terms of the Loan Agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the size of the aggregate principal amount under tranche 3 of the 2020 Term Loan (as defined below) from $75.0 to $80.0 million; (ii) extend the availability periods of certain tranches of the 2020 Term Loan; (iii) alter the terms of the performance covenants contained in the Loan Agreement and also add a new performance covenant; (iv) conditionally waive the minimum cash requirement during such periods of time that Axsome’s market capitalization exceeds $1.5 billion; and (v) permit Axsome Malta Ltd., or the Malta Subsidiary, to request an advance from the Lenders (as defined in the Loan Agreement) up to a certain amount to the extent that Axsome may request an advance in such amount and to increase the amount of cash that the Malta Subsidiary may hold outside of the United States, as set forth in greater detail in the Fifth Amendment. We drew down upon tranche 1C of the 2020 Term Loan, and as of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $180 million outstanding and $150 million remaining under the 2020 Term Loan. See the “Contractual Obligations and Commitments – January 2023 Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement – Hercules”, “Contractual Obligations and Commitments – September 2024 Fifth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement – Hercules” sections below, and Note 10. Loan and Security Agreement for more information.

In June 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and sold 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $75.00 per share. Net proceeds were $211.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $13.5 million and other offering costs of $0.2 million. Additionally, in connection with this public offering, in July 2023, the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase 450,000 additional shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $75.00 per share. The net proceeds were $31.7 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.0 million and other minimal offering costs.

In the future, we may conduct additional offerings of one or more of the securities covered by the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement in such amounts, prices and terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. At the time any of our securities covered by the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of any such offering.

On February 21, 2023, we entered into a Sublease with Advance Magazine Publishers d/b/a Conde Nast for the entirety of the twenty-second floor of One Word Trade Center in New York, NY, or the Sublease. This space is utilized as our corporate and executive offices. The Sublease commenced on April 7, 2023 and will run for ten (10) years. We have a one-time option to terminate the Sublease on its fifth anniversary upon the payment of a fee to the sublandlord. We are responsible for base rent under the Sublease and certain additional customary variable costs such as an allocable portion of building taxes and operating expenses. In connection with the Sublease, we received certain rent and work concessions from the sublandlord. The Company entered into a fleet lease program beginning the first quarter of 2024. The lease agreement includes an initial 12-month noncancelable period with monthly renewal options thereafter. Lease terms range from approximately 40 to 50 months and are classified as finance leases. See Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies for further information on future contractual obligations.

We believe that our current cash is sufficient to fund anticipated operations into cash flow positivity, based on the current operating plan. Because the process of commercializing products and evaluating product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain, it is possible that the assumptions upon which we have based this estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Operating Activities.
 Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $128.4 million as compared to $145.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $16.7 million was mainly due to higher net product revenues from Auvelity and Sunosi in 2024, which was offset by the increase in cash used in commercial and clinical activities in 2024. Operating activities in 2023 also was impacted by the receipt of a $65.7 million upfront payment from Pharmanovia in the first quarter of 2023.

Investing Activities.
 Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $270 thousand, as compared to $582 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was impacted by the expansion of our corporate headquarters during 2023.

Financing Activities.
 Cash provided by financing activities was $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which included net proceeds of $40.0 million from issuance of common stock for financing purposes as well as proceeds of $30.7 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and under the ESPP, which was partially offset by payments of contingent consideration and tax withholdings on stock awards, for a total of $11.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $331.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which included net proceeds related to the June 2023 public offering of $211.3 million and additional net proceeds of $31.7 million as the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase additional shares, net proceeds of $83.6 million from draw-downs related to the Loan Agreement with Hercules, and proceeds of $12.4 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options, offset by payments of contingent consideration and tax withholdings on stock awards for a total of $8.0 million.

Funding Requirements

We have not achieved profitability since our inception, and we expect to continue to have losses as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercially launch Symbravo while further investing in Auvelity and Sunosi. We are subject to all of the risks pertinent to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may harm our business.

We may need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations. In the event that we need additional financing, we may incur additional debt, license certain intellectual property, and seek to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, these securities could have rights or preferences senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

•
the scope, rate of progress, results, and cost of our clinical studies and other related activities;

•
our ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;

122

Table of Contents

•
the number and development requirements of any other product candidates that we pursue;

•
the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory reviews of our product candidates;

•
the costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our products and product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;

•
any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates;

•
the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;

•
the general and administrative expenses related to being a public company;

•
the revenue received from commercial sales of our products and product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and

•
the costs involved in preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending our intellectual property‑related claims.

Please see “Risk Factors” for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

License agreement with Pfizer

In January 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer. Under the terms of our exclusive license agreement with Pfizer, Pfizer received 82,019 shares of our common stock having a stated value of $8.0 million, based on the average closing price of our common stock for the ten prior trading days of $97.54, in consideration for the license and rights. Pfizer also received an upfront cash payment of $3.0 million. We determined that the fair value of each share of common stock granted to Pfizer on the closing date of January 9, 2020 was $87.24, based on the closing price of our common stock on that date. As a result, the fair value of the stock issued was $7.2 million.

Pfizer can also receive up to $323 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, and tiered mid-single to low double-digit royalties on future sales of any such approved clinical products containing compounds reboxetine esreboxetine. Pfizer will also have a right of first negotiation on any potential future strategic transactions involving AXS-12 and AXS-14.

License agreements with Antecip Bioventures

Under three exclusive license agreements with Antecip an entity owned by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., we are obligated to make specified royalty payments ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, subject to up to a 50% reduction depending on required payments to third parties, on net sales of our products containing the licensed technology of AXS-02, AXS-05, and AXS-04.

In connection with the Loan Agreement (see below), Antecip consented to the collateral assignment of one of the license agreements, among other things, under a direct agreement with us and Hercules.

Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.

September 2024 Fifth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement

On September 30, 2024, we entered into the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment amended the terms of the Loan Agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the Tranche 3 Commitment from $75.0 to $80.0 million; (ii) extend the availability periods of Tranche 1D to June 15, 2025 and that of Tranche 1E to December 15, 2025, as set forth in greater detail in the Fifth Amendment; (iii) alter the terms of Performance Covenant A, Performance Covenant B, and Performance Covenant C and also add a Performance Covenant D, as set forth in greater detail in the Fifth Amendment; (iv) conditionally waive the requirement that the Company maintain Qualified Cash in an amount greater than or equal to the sum of $30.0 million plus the Qualified Cash A/P Amount at all times during such periods of time that the Company’s Market Capitalization exceeds $1.5 billion; and (v) permit the Malta Subsidiary, to request an Advance from the Lenders up to a certain amount to the extent that the Company may request an Advance in such amount and to increase the amount of Cash that the Malta Subsidiary may hold outside of the United States, as set forth in greater detail in the Fifth Amendment.

May 2023 Fourth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement

On May 8, 2023, we entered into the Waiver and Fourth Amendment to the Loan Agreement, or the Fourth Amendment, with Hercules, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the Lenders. The Fourth Amendment increased the amount of Cash that could be held by the Malta Subsidiary outside of the United States from $3.0 million to $15.0 million for a 45-day period after the closing of the Fourth Amendment and to $10.0 million thereafter. The Fourth Amendment also waived any purported default with respect to the amount of cash held by the Malta Subsidiary prior to the date of the Fourth Amendment. In August 2023, Hercules granted Axsome a waiver to the Fourth Amendment, permitting the Malta Subsidiary to hold up to $12.5 million in Cash outside of the United States until December 31, 2023.

January 2023 Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement

On January 9, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment.

The Third Amendment amended the terms of the Loan Agreement to, among other things:

•
Extend the maturity date to January 1, 2028, unless the Company meets certain revenue targets as described in the Loan Agreement, in which case the Company can extend the maturity date to January 1, 2029; 

•
Increase the aggregate principal amount under the Loan Agreement from $300.0 million to $350.0 million; 

•
Subject to the terms and conditions in the Loan Agreement, change the term loan advance amounts and availability dates under the Tranche 1 Advance through Tranche 5 Advance, including increasing the Tranche 1 Advance from one tranche of $95.0 million to five sub-tranches of $95.0 million, $55.0 million, $30.0 million, $35.0 million, and $35.0 million, respectively, changing the Tranche 2 Advance from three sub-tranches of $35.0 million, $35.0 million, and $30.0 million, respectively, to one tranche of $25.0 million, changing the Tranche 3 Advance from two sub-tranches of $15.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to one tranche of $75.0 million, and removing the Tranche 4 Advance and Tranche 5 Advance entirely; 

•
Revise the interest rate applicable to extensions of credit under the Loan Agreement to equal (a) if the prime rate is greater than or equal to 7.00%, the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 2.20%, and (ii) 9.95%, but in no event greater than 10.70%, and (b) if the prime rate is less than 7.00%, 9.70%; 

•
Increase the minimum cash requirement of the Company to the sum of $30.0 million plus the Qualified Cash A/P Amount; and 

•
Require the Company to pay a facility fee equal to 0.75% of the amount of principal actually funded pursuant to the Tranche 1B Advance, Tranche 1C Advance, Tranche 1D Advance, Tranche 1E Advance, Tranche 2 Advance, and Tranche 3 Advance.

We allowed Tranche 2, which totaled $25.0 million, to expire undrawn.

Royalty Agreements

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2022, or the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to make non-refundable, non-creditable royalty payments to Jazz equal to a (A) high-single digit royalty for any Current Indication or (B) mid-single digit royalty for any Future Indication, of Net Sales in the U.S. Territory made during the applicable Royalty Term (in each case, as those terms are defined in the Purchase Agreement). There are no royalty payments due to Jazz for Net Sales outside of the U.S. Territory.

At the initial closing, we assumed all of the commitments of Jazz to SK and Aerial. SK is the originator of Sunosi and retains rights in 12 Asian markets, including China, Korea, and Japan. In 2014, Jazz acquired from Aerial worldwide rights to Sunosi excluding those Asian markets stated previously. The assumed commitments to SK and Aerial include single-digit tiered royalties based on our sales of Sunosi, and we are committed to pay up to $165.0 million based on revenue milestones and $1.0 million based on development milestones.

Shelf Registration Statement

On December 2, 2022, we filed the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-235372) with the SEC for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt securities, and units, which became effective immediately upon filing. At the time any of the securities covered by the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement are offered for sale, we prepare and file a prospectus supplement with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of any such offering.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off‑balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These market risks are principally limited to interest rate fluctuations. We had cash of $315.4 million as of December 31, 2024. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short‑term nature of our investment portfolio and debt agreement, which use short-term interest rates and the prime rate, respectively, we do not believe an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and, accordingly, we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We contract with vendors and third-party manufactures located in Europe and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. Royalty revenues from Pharmanovia are derived from their sales of Sunosi in ex-U.S markets and those sales are denominated in Euros. We are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for the Euro, Swiss Franc, and British Pound, in connection with these agreements, and recognize foreign exchange gains or losses in our statement of operations. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risk. To date, we have not incurred any material effects from foreign currency changes on these transactions.

We do not believe a 10% change in these currencies on December 31, 2024 would have had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Inflation Risk

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and pricing of contracts. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. 
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
 There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Ind
ependent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Reserves for Variable Consideration - Commercial Managed Care — 
Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As more fully disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company records revenues net of provisions for rebates, discounts, and other incentives and returns, which are established at the time of sale. These reductions are attributed to various commercial arrangements, managed healthcare organizations, and government programs that mandate various reductions from list price.

Chargebacks and cash discounts are reflected as a reduction to receivables and settled through the issuance of credits to the customer. All other rebates, discounts and adjustments, are reflected as a liability and settled through cash payments.

Table of Contents

The provision related to Commercial Managed Care rebate programs (the “Commercial rebate accruals”) involves the use of significant assumptions and judgments in its calculation. These significant assumptions and judgments include consideration of prior payment history, customer utilization mix data, changes to product price, expected patient usage, claims timing lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel.

Given the complexity involved in determining the assumptions used in calculating the Commercial rebate accruals, auditing these estimates involved especially subjective judgment.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to Commercial rebate accruals included the following, among others:

•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the Company’s methods and assumptions used to calculate Commercial rebate accruals.

•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the review of the Company’s estimation model, including underlying assumptions and key inputs into the Company’s process to calculate Commercial rebate accruals.

•
We tested the mathematical accuracy of Commercial rebate accruals.

•
We tested the assumptions and key inputs used to calculate Commercial rebate accruals.

•
We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate Commercial rebate accruals accurately by comparing actual amounts incurred for Commercial rebate accruals.

•
We tested the overall reasonableness of the Commercial rebate accruals recorded at period end by developing an expectation for comparison to actual recorded balances.

•
We involved audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience to assist us in performing our auditing procedures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)

Note 1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation
Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (“Axsome” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company leading a new era in the treatment of central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders. The Company delivers scientific breakthroughs by identifying critical gaps in care and develops differentiated products with a focus on novel mechanisms of action that enable meaningful advancements in patient outcomes. Axsome was incorporated on January 12, 2012, in the State of Delaware. The Company’s CNS portfolio includes 
three
 approved products – Auvelity
®
 (the components of which are referred to as “AXS-05”), Sunosi
®
 (the components of which are referred to as “solriamfetol”), both of which are also being developed for further indications, and Symbravo
®
 (the components of which are referred to as “AXS-07”), which was recently approved by the FDA on January 30, 2025 – as well as 
two
 product candidates, AXS-12, and AXS-14, which are being developed for multiple indications. The Company refers herein to Auvelity, Sunosi, Symbravo, AXS-12, AXS-14, and its programs to develop additional indications for AXS-05 and solriamfetol as the Company’s products.
The Company acquired the U.S. rights to Sunosi from Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (“Jazz”) in May 2022 and worldwide ex-U.S. rights (excluding certain Asian markets) from Jazz in November 2022 (collectively, the “Acquisition”). Sunosi is a product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and marketed in the U.S. to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (“EDS”) associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. Sunosi was approved in Europe in January 2020 by the European Commission. In February 2023, the Company announced a licensing transaction with Atnahs Pharma UK Limited (“Pharmanovia”) to market Sunosi in Europe and certain countries in the Middle East / North Africa.
The Company announced, in August 2022, FDA approval of Auvelity, and in October 2022, the U.S. commercial availability of Auvelity, for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.
The Company announced, in January 2025, FDA approval of Symbravo (meloxicam and rizatriptan) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated during the consolidation process.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur operating losses and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
1,122.8
 million.
The Company’s primary sources of cash have been proceeds from the sales of Auvelity and Sunosi, the issuance and sale of its common stock in public offerings, and the issuance of debt. The Company’s ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors, including its ability to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, successfully complete any post-approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize its product candidates alone or in partnership with third parties. The Company may continue to incur substantial operating losses even as it continues to generate revenues from its products.
The Company believes its existing cash will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operating cash requirements for at least twelve months following the date of this filing. During that time, the Company expects that its expenses will increase primarily due to the commercialization of Auvelity, Sunosi, and Symbravo while continuing to further develop the Company’s pipeline assets. The Company may use a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements if market conditions are favorable or as a result of other strategic considerations to finance its future cash needs.
The Company’s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market and trades under the symbol “AXSM.”

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Risks and Uncertainties
The Company’s operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect its operating results and financial condition. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the results of clinical testing and trial activities of the Company’s product candidates; the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approval to market its products; competition from products manufactured and sold or being developed by other companies; the price of, and demand for, the Company’s products; the Company’s ability to negotiate favorable licensing or other manufacturing and marketing agreements for its products; and the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. If the Company’s commercialization of its products is not financially successful, it will be unable to generate sufficient recurring product revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.
The Company currently has three commercial products, Auvelity and Sunosi, and recently FDA-approved product, Symbravo, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development efforts will result in successfully commercialized products in addition to Auvelity and Sunosi. Developing and commercializing a product requires significant time and capital and is subject to regulatory review and approval as well as competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change and is dependent upon the continued services of its employees and consultants and obtaining and protecting intellectual property.
Use of Estimates
Management considers many factors in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of ultimate future outcomes, and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. This process may result in actual results differing materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of the financial statements if these results differ from historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such assumptions are reasonable when made. In preparing these financial statements, management used significant estimates in the following areas, among others: stock-based compensation expense; determination of fair value of warrants; accounting for research and development costs; accounting for acquisitions; impairments of goodwill and the intangible asset; determination of fair value of contingent consideration; chargebacks, cash discounts, sales rebates, returns and other adjustments; and the recoverability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of a promised good or service, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the good or service. Transfer of control is based on contractual performance obligations, which occurs upon transfer of the title along with the physical transfer of the Company’s goods to the customer, as that is when the customer has obtained control of significantly all of the economic benefits and the Company obtains a right of payment.

To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under ASC 606, including when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. For a complete discussion of accounting for product sales, see Product Sales, net (below) and Note 15. Revenues
.
License Agreements
The Company generates revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of certain products. Such agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses. Payments made by the customer may include non-refundable upfront fees, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and royalties on sales of products.
If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to the license as revenue upon transfer of control of the license. All other promised goods or services in the agreement are evaluated to determine if they are distinct. If they are not distinct, they are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that is distinct. Optional future services where any additional consideration paid to the Company reflects their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right, and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations. If optional future services are priced in a manner which provides the customer with a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights and are accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Contingent milestones at contract inception are estimated to the extent that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received, and, therefore, the variable consideration is constrained. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achieving development or sales-based milestone payments that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and, if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue, as well as earnings, in the period of adjustment.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments, and a license of intellectual property that is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, revenue is recognized at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Product Sales, net
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves for variable consideration. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimate of the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. The Company sells Auvelity and Sunosi in the United States to wholesale distributors with whom the Company has entered into formal agreements (collectively, the “Distributors”). These Distributors subsequently resell the Company’s products to retail pharmacies. The Company also sells Sunosi to Distributors in Canada and on a product supply basis to Pharmanovia. Sunosi is subsequently sold by Pharmanovia in certain ex-U.S. markets. The Company does not sell products under consignment arrangements, and the collection of proceeds from product sales is not contingent upon customers’ sale of the goods to third parties. The Company received FDA approval for Symbravo in January 2025 and did not record any product sales with respect to Symbravo for the periods covered by this report. See Note 15. Revenues for a further breakout of product sales, net.
Reserves for Variable Consideration
The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimate of the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled based on the terms of the contracts and are classified as reductions to accounts receivable, net if payable to a customer or accrued expenses and other current liabilities if payable to a third-party. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
The provision for rebates, discounts, and other incentives is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for rebates, discounts, and other incentives and returns, which are established at the time of sale. The Company uses customer segment utilization mix data, changes to product price, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the variable consideration. Amounts accrued for rebates, discounts, and other incentives are adjusted when trends indicate that adjustment is appropriate and to reflect actual experience.
Trade Discounts and Allowances
 - The Company generally provides discounts which include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company compensates (through trade discounts and allowances) its distributors for distribution services and data. These payments have been recorded as a reduction to product sales as well as a reduction to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
Product Returns -
 The Company generally offers a limited right of return for product that has been purchased from the Company based on the product’s expiration date. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product sale is recognized, as well as a component of accrued expense and other current liabilities. The Company currently estimates product return liabilities using available industry data, historical product sales information, and actual returns experience.
Chargebacks and Discounts -
 Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products at prices lower than the list prices charged to distributors. Distributors charge the Company for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price. These reserves are established in the same period that the related product sales are recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales and accounts receivable, net.

Rebates -
 Rebates apply to: Medicaid, managed care, and supplemental rebates to all applicable states as defined by the statutory government pricing calculation requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Tricare rebates to the TRICARE third-party administrator are based on the statutory calculation defined in the agreement with the Defense Health Agency. Part D and Commercial Managed Care rebates are paid based on the contracts with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (“PBMs”) and Managed Care Organizations. Rebates are paid to these entities upon receipt of an invoice from the contracted entity which is based on the utilization of the product by the members of the contracted entity. Allowances for rebates also include amounts due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for Medicare Part D. The Company estimates these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related product sales are recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales as well as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Coverage Gap -
 The Medicare Part D coverage gap is a period of consumer payment for prescription medication costs which lies between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic-coverage threshold, when the patient is a member of a Medicare Part D prescription-drug program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Company estimates the percentage of goods sold to patients in the Coverage Gap and adjusts the transaction price for such discount at the time of sale resulting in a reduction to product sales as well as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Other Incentives -
 Other incentives which the Company offers include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the co-pay assistance program, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially-insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue. The reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product sales as well as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
The Company makes significant estimates and judgments that materially affect its recognition of net product revenue. Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to the Company significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. The Company will adjust its estimates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for its products, as it becomes available.
Cost of Revenue
The Company’s cost of revenue consists of cost of product sales, fee sharing expense related to the upfront license revenue received, and expense related to a sales-based milestone. Cost of product sales primarily include direct costs (inclusive of material, shipping, handling, and manufacturing costs), overhead and product royalties. Cost of product sales excludes depreciation and amortization. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $
2.5
 million expense for the achievement of a sales-based milestone related to world-wide Sunosi sales. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a $
5.0
 million fee sharing expense related to the upfront license revenue received.
The Company assumed royalty and sales-based milestone commitments of Jazz to SK Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (“SK”) and Aerial Biopharma, LLC (“Aerial”). SK is the originator of Sunosi and retains rights in 
12
 Asian markets, including China, Korea and Japan. In 2014, Jazz acquired from Aerial worldwide rights to Sunosi excluding those Asian markets stated previously. The assumed commitments to SK and Aerial include single-digit tiered royalties based on the Company’s sales of Sunosi, and the Company is committed to pay up to $
165
 million based on revenue milestones and $
1
 million based on development milestones. Additionally, the Company pays a royalty to Antecip Bioventures II LLC (“Antecip”), an entity owned by Axsome’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., equal to 
3.0
% of Auvelity net sales.
Foreign Currency Translation
Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date they are incurred. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at period-end exchange rates. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency into U.S. dollars is included in the statements of operations and is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker or decision-making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business as 
one
 operating and reporting segment, which is the business of developing and delivering novel therapies for the management of CNS disorders. See 
Note 20. Segment Information
 for further information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments that have maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents includes holdings in checking and overnight sweep accounts. The Company’s cash equivalents, which are money market funds held in a sweep account, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was $
315.4
 million, which approximates fair value and was determined based upon Level 1 inputs. The sweep account is valued using quoted market prices with no valuation adjustments applied. Accordingly, these securities are categorized as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy.
Concentration of Risk
Concentration of Credit Risk -
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash deposits at financial institutions, which cash deposits exceed insured limits. At December 31, 2024
, the majority of the Company’s cash was held by 
two
 financial institutions, and amounts on deposit were in excess of government-provided insurance limits. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in what it believes to be high credit quality banks and money market funds and has not recognized any losses from credit risks on such accounts since inception. See Accounts Receivable, net below for further information.
Concentration of Risk, Other -
 The Company has a limited number of contract manufacturers for its products. At times, the Company may have only one manufacturer or supplier for its products.
Business Combination
The Company accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that all identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recorded at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates in valuing the intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired patented technology. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
As a result of the Acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill and an intangible asset.

Goodwill
Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and therefore not amortized. The Company tests the carrying amounts of goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, the Company first evaluates the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative factors determine it is necessary to complete a goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is determined and compared to its carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be recoverable, and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, and a charge is reported in impairment of goodwill in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment as of December 31. As of December 31, 2024
, the Company has determined that it has 
one
 reporting unit. The Company has not identified any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the existence of potential impairment of goodwill during the fiscal year ended December 31, 
2024
. The balance of goodwill was $
12.0
 million at both December 31, 
2024 and December 31, 2023.
Intangible Asset
The Company’s intangible asset is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period of benefit of ten years. The Company evaluates recoverability of the intangible asset periodically by considering events or changes in circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. The Company has not identified any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the existence of potential impairment of the intangible asset during the year ended December 31, 2024
.

Contingent Consideration
Consideration paid in a business combination may include potential future payments that are contingent upon the acquired business achieving certain milestones in the future (“contingent consideration”). The royalty payments due to Jazz are a high single-digit royalty on the Company’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi in the current indication and a mid single-digit royalty on the Company’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi for future indications. Contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during such period a change is recognized. The Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date and reporting periods thereafter using the probability weighted income approach and makes significant assumptions, including estimated future sales of Sunosi in current and future indications, timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievements, probability of technical and regulatory success rates, and discount rates. Contingent consideration liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date are presented in current liabilities, with the non-current portion recorded within total liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are reported using a three‑level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

F-

Table of Contents

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. An asset’s or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company’s financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, contingent warrant liability, current and long-term debt, and current and non-current contingent consideration. The Company’s Level 1 financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities. They are considered Level 1 as the carrying values reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of debt on the Company’s balance sheet is estimated to approximate its fair value. The Company’s Level 3 financial instruments include contingent warrant liability and current and non-current contingent consideration due to the significant unobservable inputs required in determining their respective fair values.
The Company categorized the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as the estimate is based on significant unobservable inputs requiring management judgment. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by using the probability weighted income approach using significant assumptions, including estimated future sales of Sunosi in current and future indications, timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievements, probability of technical and regulatory success and discount rates. Contingent consideration liabilities are subject to remeasurement at each prospective balance sheet date, with any changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments for further detail.
The Company estimated the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black-Scholes model based on key assumption and inputs. The Company utilizes a probability assessment to estimate the likelihood of vesting for the remaining Loan Agreement (as defined below) warrants and allocated the probability of occurrence percentage to the fair values calculated, and, therefore, is considered Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for warrants anticipated to be issued in the future under the Loan Agreement as liabilities and measures them at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each prospective balance sheet date, with any changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 for further detail.
Accounts Receivable, net
The Company’s accounts receivable, net, arise from product sales and represent amounts due from its customers. They are generally stated at the gross sales amount, less reserves resulting from trade discounts and allowances and chargebacks. Accounts receivable typically have a standard payment term of 
60 days or less
 and do not bear interest.

The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company began distributing products through wholesale customers. The Company estimates expected credit losses of its accounts receivable by assessing the risk of loss and available relevant information about collectability, including historical credit losses, existing contractual payment terms, actual payment patterns of its customers, individual customer circumstances, and reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions expected to exist throughout the contractual life of the receivable. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses. Based on its assessment, as of December 31, 2024
, the Company has 
no
t recorded any allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. For further information about accounts receivable, see 
Note 4. Accounts Receivable, net
.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs consist of costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing. These costs are classified on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and subsequently amortized as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations using the effective interest rate method.

F-
16

Table of Contents

The Company evaluates amendments to its debt instruments in accordance with ASC 470-50, 
Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
 (“ASC 470”) to determine whether the amendment should be accounted for as a modification or an extinguishment. An amendment may be considered modified when the terms of the new debt and original instrument are not “substantially different” (as defined in the debt modification guidance in ASC 470). Amendments that are considered modifications are accounted for prospectively as yield adjustments, based on the revised terms, and lender fees and costs directly incurred with third parties, to the extent material, are recorded as debt discount and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.
Inventory
The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The remaining inventory associated with the Acquisition is stated at fair value due to purchase accounting. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and it writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, if they occur, are recorded within cost of revenue.
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Company’s products after regulatory approval when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Inventory acquired and manufactured prior to receipt of regulatory approval of a product candidate is expensed as research and development expense as incurred. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial product is expensed as research and development expense when selected for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.
Inventory levels are evaluated for amounts that would be sold within one year. If the level of inventory exceeds the estimated amount that would be sold after the next 12 months, the Company classifies the estimate of such inventory as non-current.
Equipment, net
Equipment consists primarily of computer equipment and is recorded at cost. Equipment is depreciated on a straight‑line basis over its estimated useful life, which the Company estimates to be 
three years
. When equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in operating expenses.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, contract services, costs incurred to third-party service providers for conducting research, preclinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies, product license fees, consulting and other related expenses. Research, preclinical and clinical study expenses are estimated based on services performed, pursuant to contracts with third-party research and development organizations that conduct and manage research, preclinical and clinical activities on the Company’s behalf, including discussions with internal management personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, accruals are adjusted accordingly. Payments associated with licensing agreements to acquire licenses to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future use are expensed as incurred.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. The Company considers advertising costs as expenses related to the promotion of the Company’s commercial products. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, advertising costs were $
101.2
 million, $
100.3
 million, and $
35.3
 million, respectively.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. As of December 31, 2024
, the Company does not believe any material uncertain tax positions are present. In the event the Company determines that accrual of interest or penalties are necessary in the future, the amount will be presented as a component of income tax expense.
Stock-Based Compensation
For stock options issued, the Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option using the Black‑Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model takes into account the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, the risk-free interest rate, the estimated life of the option, the closing market price of the Company’s common stock and the exercise price. The estimates utilized in the Black-Scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. In addition, the Company accounts for equity award forfeitures as they occur.
For restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the Company issues them in the form of Company common stock. The fair market value of these awards is based on the market closing price per share on the grant date.
The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of the stock options and RSUs over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term. For awards only subject to service-based vesting conditions, the Company elected to recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis. For awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method when the achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The expense related to the stock-based compensation is recorded within the same financial statement line item as the grantee’s cash compensation.
The Company’s policy upon exercise of stock options and RSUs is that shares will be issued as new shares drawing on the Company’s 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan share pool that was adopted by the stockholders in November 2015.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share
Basic net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of common stock includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as warrants, stock options, RSUs and/or common stock pursuant to the 2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock. As the impact of these items is anti-dilutive during periods of net loss, there was no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
.

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. When evaluating whether a contract contains a lease, the Company considers whether (1) the contract explicitly or implicitly identifies assets that are contractually defined and (2) the Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract.
The Company’s lease agreements contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company has applied the practical expedient to combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component, which increases the amount of lease assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, variable payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease asset and liability.
Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When determining the lease term, the Company includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company uses the interest rate implicit in the contract when such rate is readily determinable and uses the Company’s incremental borrowing rate when the rate implicit in the contract is not readily determinable based upon the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments.
The Company’s operating leases are reflected in the right-of-use operating asset; operating lease liability, current portion; and operating lease liability, long-term portion in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Finance leases are included in the non-current inventory and other assets; accrued expenses and other current liabilities; and finance lease liability, long-term in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets under the finance leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Short-term leases, defined as leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at the commencement date, and do not include an option to extend the term or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, are excluded from this treatment and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805). This update requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This differs from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company 
adopted
 this standard as of 
January 1, 2023
 and concluded it did 
not have a material impact
 on the Company’s financial statements. See 
Note 3. Business Combination for further information.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment reporting, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. The standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company 
adopted
 this standard as of 
January 1, 2024
. See 
Note 20. Segment Information for further information.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid by jurisdiction, enhances disclosures in the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3. Business Combination
Acquisition of Assets of Jazz Pharmaceuticals

On March 25, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Jazz, pursuant to which the Company was to acquire commercial and development rights with respect to Sunosi from Jazz in certain U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. The Acquisition occurred in two separate closings. The sale and purchase of specified initial assets contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on May 9, 2022 (the “Initial Closing”), following the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions under the Purchase Agreement. The sale and purchase of specified ex-U.S. assets contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on November 14, 2022, following the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions under the Purchase Agreement (the “Final Closing”). The Company accounted for the Initial Closing as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and the Company accounted for the Final Closing as an asset acquisition.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company received from Jazz worldwide commercial, development, manufacturing, and intellectual property rights to Sunosi, except for certain Asian markets. Jazz received from the Company a total upfront payment of $
53
 million. In addition, Jazz will receive a high single-digit royalty on the Company’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi in the current indication, and a mid single-digit royalty on the Company’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi in future indications. The Company also assumed the commitments of Jazz to SK and Aerial. SK is the originator of Sunosi and retains rights in 
12
 Asian markets, including China, Korea and Japan. In 2014, Jazz acquired from Aerial worldwide rights to Sunosi excluding those Asian markets as stated previously. The assumed commitments to SK and Aerial include single-digit tiered royalties based on the Company’s sales of Sunosi, and additionally, the Company is committed to pay up to $
165
 million based on revenue milestones and $
1
 million based on development milestones. The Company financed the transaction via its existing term loan facility with Hercules Capital, Inc.

(1) The adjustment to goodwill resulted from rebates and returns during the post-acquisition period, which were provisionally recorded as an asset and liability, respectively, as of the acquisition date.
The net assets were recorded at their estimated fair value. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates were based primarily on future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, and appropriate discount rates.

Table of Contents

Inventories acquired included raw materials, work in process and finished goods for Sunosi. Inventories were recorded at their estimated fair values categorized as Level 3. The fair value of finished goods was determined based on the estimated selling price, net of selling costs and a margin on the selling activities. The fair value of work in process was determined based on estimated selling price, net of selling costs and costs to complete the manufacturing, and a margin on the selling and manufacturing activities. The fair value of raw materials was estimated to equal the replacement cost. A step-up in the value of inventory of $
1.1
 million was originally recorded in connection with the Acquisition and is being amortized through cost of revenue as the underlying product is sold.
Other current assets acquired were sample inventory and the rebates for Sunosi sales by the Company after the Initial Closing to be covered by Jazz.
The intangible asset is acquired developed technology. Fair value was determined by applying the income approach, which recognizes that the fair value of an asset is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits such as earnings and cash inflows based on current sales projections and estimated direct costs, using a discount rate of 
43.5
% that reflects the return requirements of the market. The intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 
10
 years.
Goodwill is considered an indefinite-lived asset and relates primarily to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the assembled workforce and synergies between the entities. The Company expects that the entire amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill will be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes over a 
15-year
 period.
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities acquired were the Company’s assumed sales returns liability for Sunosi after the transaction close date related to Sunosi sales recorded by Jazz prior to the Initial Closing.

The Company’s fair value measurement of contingent consideration liabilities has been classified as Level 3 as its valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors which requires use of unobservable inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are estimated by using the probability weighted income approach using significant assumptions including estimated future sales of Sunosi in current and future indications, timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievements, probability of technical and regulatory success rates, and discount rates. If significant changes are made to one or more of these assumptions, the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.

Table of Contents

As collateral for the obligations, the Company has granted to Hercules a senior security interest in all of the Company’s right, title, and interest in, to and under all of the Company’s property, inclusive of intellectual property, which includes one of the Company’s existing license agreements (the “License Agreement”) with Antecip, an entity owned by Axsome’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., subject to limited exceptions. Antecip consented to the collateral assignment of the License Agreement, among other things, under a direct agreement (the “Direct Agreement”) with the Company, Antecip and Hercules.
The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants by the Company limiting additional indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, certain corporate changes, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes. At the initial closing, there were no applicable financial covenants contained in the Loan Agreement. Effective upon closing of the Fifth Amendment in September 2024, the following limited financial covenants apply:
•
The Company at all times must maintain Qualified Cash in an aggregate amount greater than or equal to $
30.0
 million plus the Qualified Cash A/P Amount; provided that compliance with such covenant shall be conditionally waived during such periods of time that the Company’s Market Capitalization exceeds $
1.5
 billion. 
•
The Company must meet, beginning June 30, 2023, any of the following conditions: (A) ensure that at all times its market capitalization exceeds $
1.0
 billion and that it maintains Qualified Cash in an amount not less than 
30
% of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Advances plus the Qualified Cash A/P Amount, (B) ensure that at all times that it maintains Qualified Cash in an amount not less than

1.5
 billion. Alternatively, the Company must, beginning with fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, and for each quarter thereafter, achieve T6M Net Product Revenue in an amount equal to at least the amount set forth on Schedule 7.20(b) of the Loan Agreement opposite the last day of each fiscal quarter identified in the table therein, tested on a quarterly basis.
•
Axsome Malta, a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Malta, may request an Advance from the Lenders up to a certain amount to the extent that the Company may request an Advance in such amount, and Axsome Malta may not hold Cash outside of the United States in excess of the sum of $
10.0
 million and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Advances drawn by Axsome Malta.
•
Restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, encumber its intellectual property, or engage in certain fundamental business transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions of other businesses, with certain exceptions.
The Company’s obligations under the Loan Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, insolvency and a material adverse change in the Borrower’s business, operations or financial or other condition.
In addition, the Company is required to pay certain end of term charges, including (A) an initial end of term charge of $
4.45
 million and (B) a subsequent end of term charge of (i) 
1.10
% of the aggregate amount of all Tranche 1A Advances plus (ii) 
4.95
% of the aggregate amount of all term loan advances (other than Tranche 1A Advances) funded minus (iii) any charges paid by the Borrower to the Lenders related to partial prepayments of the outstanding Secured Obligations. The end of term charges are being accreted into interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan.
If certain maturity extension conditions are satisfied, the Company must pay an extension end of term charge equal to 
1.00
% of the aggregate amount of all Term Loan Advances outstanding as of the date on which the maturity extension conditions are satisfied, in addition to the end of term charges described above.

The Company may, at its option prepay the term loans in full or in part, subject to a prepayment penalty equal to (i) 
2.0
% of the Advance amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs prior to February 1, 2024, (ii) 
1.5
% of the Advance amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or after February 1, 2024 but prior to February 1, 2025, and (iii) 
1.0
% of the Advance amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or after February 1, 2025 but prior to February 1, 2026.

The Company evaluated whether the Third Amendment entered into in January 2023 represented a debt modification or extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, 
Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
. As the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the Third Amendment is less than 
10
% different from the remaining cash flows under the terms of the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification. The unamortized balance of debt discount costs incurred in connection with those loans and additional debt discount costs incurred in connection with entry into the Third Amendment are being amortized through maturity in January 2028 utilizing the effective interest rate method.
The Company also evaluated whether the Fifth Amendment entered into September 2024 represented a debt modification or extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470. As the terms of the Fifth Amendment are not substantially different as compared to that of the Fourth Amendment, the Company treated the amendment as a debt modification.

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
Leases are accounted for under ASC Topic 842. The Company made an accounting policy election not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases. The Company recognizes the lease payments for short-term leases in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Therefore, the Company is not recognizing a lease liability or right-of-use asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 
12
 months or less and does not include an option to 
extend
 the term or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has entered into a lease agreement for the Company’s principal executive offices located in New York, NY. The lease does not include any restrictions or covenants that had to be accounted for under the lease guidance.

In 
February 2023
, the Company entered into a 
ten-year
 agreement to sublease office space at One World Trade Center, which began in April 2023. Based on the Company’s past experience and current expectation for administrative office needs, the Company determined the lease term to be 
five years
. As of December 31, 
2024
, the remaining lease term for the Company’s operating lease was 
3.3
 years with the discount rate of 
12.0
%. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, which represents an internally developed rate that would be incurred to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
The Company entered into a fleet lease program beginning the first quarter of 2024. The lease agreement includes an initial 
12
-month noncancelable period with monthly renewal options thereafter. Lease terms range from approximately 
40
 to 
50
 months and are classified as finance leases. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability, both, of $
5.4
 million in connection to this lease. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
right-of-use asset
 and lease liability related to the finance lease were $
4.3
 million and $
4.4
 million, respectively, and the weighted average remaining lease term was 
3.1
 years, with a weighted average discount rate of 
9.0
%.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method as described in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to stock-based compensation. The simplified method was chosen because the Company has limited historical option exercise experience due to its short operating history. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for a period approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does 
no
t expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In prior years, expected volatility was based on historical volatilities of similar entities within the Company’s industry which were commensurate with the Company’s expected term assumption. Currently, expected volatility is based on historical volatility information of the Company’s common stock since the Company’s initial public offering in 2015.
The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants is as follows:

Note 16. License Agreements
License Agreement with Pharmanovia
In February 2023, Axsome Malta, a Malta limited company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pharmanovia (the “Pharmanovia License Agreement”) to commercialize and further develop Sunosi in Europe and certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the Pharmanovia License Agreement, the Company retains its existing interest in Sunosi intellectual property and licenses those rights in the Territory to Pharmanovia. Pharmanovia is solely responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of Sunosi in the Territory. The Company will continue to manufacture Sunosi and provide product supply to Pharmanovia for an indefinite period of time, and the Company will recognize revenue as a component of product sales, net, when product is supplied to Pharmanovia.
In consideration for entering the Pharmanovia License Agreement, the Company received a non-refundable upfront payment of €
62.0
 million ($
65.7
 million). The Company also will receive a royalty percentage in the mid-twenties on Sunosi net sales in the Territory and is eligible to receive sales-based milestone payments totaling up to €
94.5
 million.

F-

Table of Contents

 The Company evaluated the Pharmanovia License Agreement under ASC 606 and concluded that Pharmanovia represents a customer in the transaction. The initial transaction price consisted of the non-refundable upfront payment, which was recognized as License Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 upon transfer of the license to Pharmanovia, as the requirement for revenue recognition under ASC 606 were met. The remaining forms of consideration are variable because they are dependent on the achievement of sales-based or other milestones. The Company evaluated the constraint on variable consideration and concluded that the milestone payments are dependent on regulatory approvals and actions of third parties, and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence. Therefore, at contract inception, the milestones are not included in the transaction price as it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur. Sales-based milestones will be recognized as revenue in the period when the related sales threshold is met. All other development or regulatory milestones will be recognized as revenue immediately in the period the underlying milestone is achieved. Any consideration related to sales-based royalties will be recognized when the related sales occur. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized royalty revenue of $
3.5
 million related to Pharmanovia’s sales of Sunosi, and $
0.5
 million related to an achievement of a regulatory milestone in China for Sunosi from SK in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
No
 other development or sales-based milestones were recognized during the year ended December 31, 
2024.
Exclusive License Agreement with Pfizer
In January 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) for Pfizer’s clinical and nonclinical data, and intellectual property for reboxetine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in AXS-12 which the Company is developing for the treatment of narcolepsy. The agreement also provides the Company exclusive rights to develop and commercialize esreboxetine, a new late-stage product candidate referred to as AXS-14, in the U.S. for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer received 
82,019
 shares of the Company’s common stock having a stated value of $
8.0
 million, based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the 
ten
 prior trading days of $
97.54
, in consideration for the license and rights and also received an upfront cash payment of $
3.0
 million. The Company determined that the fair value of each share of common stock granted to Pfizer on the closing date of January 9, 2020 was $
87.24
, based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on that date. As a result, the fair value of the stock issued was $
7.2
 million and, therefore, the total research and development expense recognized was $
10.2
 million related to the Pfizer license agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Pfizer can also receive up to $
323
 million in regulatory and sales milestones, and tiered mid-single to low double-digit royalties on future sales related to the licensed products. Pfizer will also have a right of first negotiation on any potential future strategic transactions involving AXS-12 and AXS-14. During the years ended December 31, 
2024 and 2023
, 
no
 milestone payments or royalties were paid to Pfizer by the Company.

Exclusive License Agreements with Antecip
In 2012, the Company entered into 
three
 exclusive license agreements with Antecip, an entity owned by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., in which the Company was granted exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize Antecip’s patents and applications related to the development of AXS-05 (now marketed as Auvelity) and two product candidates no longer under active development, anywhere in the world for human therapeutic, veterinary, and diagnostic use. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize these product candidates. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is required to pay to Antecip a royalty equal to 
3.0
% for AXS-05 (and 
1.5
% or 
4.5
% for the other two product candidates no longer under active development), of net sales of products containing the licensed technology by the Company, its affiliates, or permitted sublicensees. These royalty payments are subject to reduction by an amount up to 
50.0
% of any required payments to third parties. Unless earlier terminated by a party for cause or by the Company for convenience, the agreements shall remain in effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later to occur of (i) the applicable product is no longer covered by a valid claim in that country or (ii) 
10 years
 from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in that country. Upon expiration of the agreements with respect to a product in a country, the Company’s license grant for that product in that country will become a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual non-exclusive license. If Antecip terminates any of the agreements for cause, or if the Company exercises its right to terminate any of the agreements for convenience, the rights granted to the Company under such terminated agreement will revert to Antecip. The Company began recording royalty payments to Antecip along with the initiation of sales of Auvelity (the components of which are referred to as “AXS-05”) in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 
2024
, the Company recorded royalty expense of $
8.7
 million for royalty due to Antecip, which is equal to 
3.0
% of net sales of Auvelity. This is considered to be a related party transaction.
In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company entered into the Direct Agreement with Antecip and Hercules, pursuant to which Antecip consented to the collateral assignment of the License Agreement under the Loan Agreement, among other things.

Note 17. Royalty Agreements
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to make non-refundable, non-creditable royalty payments to Jazz equal to a (A) high single-digit royalty for any current indication, or (B) mid single-digit royalty for any future indication of net sales in the U.S. Territory made during the applicable royalty term. There are no royalty payments due to Jazz for Net Sales outside of the U.S. Territory.
At the Initial Closing, the Company assumed all of the commitments of Jazz to SK and Aerial. SK is the originator of Sunosi and retains rights in 
12
 Asian markets, including China, Korea and Japan. In 2014, Jazz acquired from Aerial worldwide rights to Sunosi excluding those Asian markets stated previously. The assumed commitments to SK and Aerial include single-digit tiered royalties based on the Company’s sales of Sunosi, and additionally, the Company is committed to pay up to $
165
 million based on revenue milestones and $
1
 million based on development milestones. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $
2.5
 million expense for the achievement of a sales-based milestone related to world-wide Sunosi sales.

Note 18. Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $

 million and foreign NOL carryforwards of $
4.8
 million. U.S. federal NOLs amounting to $
59.8
 million generated before the 2018 tax year will start expiring beginning 
2032
, and the NOLs of approximately $
512.3
 million generated in 2018 and later have an indefinite carryforward period. The NOL carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state tax authorities. NOL carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that the Company can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.

A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets where the recoverability of the assets is uncertain. The determination to provide a valuation allowance is dependent upon the assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of the available evidence, which includes the Company’s historical operating losses and forecast of future losses, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting from the tax loss and credits carried forward. The valuation allowance increased by $
58.7
 million, $
39.0
 million and $
26.9
 million, in 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as a result of the increase of the deferred tax assets.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
0.1
 million of income tax expense due to state taxes that the Company expects to pay based on minimum tax requirements in various states. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $
1.0
 million of income tax expense related to its foreign operations in Malta primarily due to a one-time payment received in connection with the Pharmanovia License Agreement. There was 
no
 income tax expense or benefit recorded by the Company in any other jurisdiction due to its net loss tax position and full valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. As of December 31, 
2024
, the Company does not believe any material uncertain tax positions are present.

Table of Contents

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the Company’s 2021 U.S. income tax return. The Company is not currently under examination at the state level. The Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating losses have occurred since its inception in 2012 and as such, tax years subject to potential tax examination could apply from that date because the utilization of net operating losses from prior years opens the relevant year to audit by the IRS and/or state taxing authorities.

The Company has elected to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements.

Note 19. Related Party Transactions
From the Company’s inception, Herriot Tabuteau, M.D. has been the Company’s founder, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Company’s Board, and the beneficial owner of more than 
5
% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. In connection with the formation of the Company, in January 2012, the Company issued to Antecip Bioventures II LLC, an entity controlled by Dr. Tabuteau, an aggregate of 
7,344,500
 shares of the Company’s common stock for nominal consideration. Additionally, since the launch of Auvelity in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded royalty expense of $
8.7
 million and $
3.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 
2024 and 2023
, respectively, which equal 
3.0
% of net sales for those respective years.

The Company is a party to 
three
 exclusive license agreements with Antecip Bioventures II LLC, an entity owned by Dr. Tabuteau. See 
Note 16. License Agreements
 for further information regarding the license agreements.

Note 20. Segment Information
The Company views its operations and manages its business as 
one
 operating and reportable segment, which is the business of developing and delivering novel therapies for the management of CNS disorders. The Company’s focus centers around the CNS disorders market as its primary operating environment. Consistent with the operational structure, the 
Chief Executive Officer
, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), manages and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. This decision making process reflects the way in which the financial information is regularly reviewed and used by the CODM to evaluate performance, set operational targets, forecast future financial results, and allocate resources.

The Company’s CODM assesses financial performance and allocates resources based on consolidated net loss that also is reported on the consolidated statements of operations. 
The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets. The CODM utilizes consolidated net loss by comparing actual results against budgeted amounts on a quarterly basis. As part of this process, consolidated net loss is a critical performance measure used to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and guide strategic decisions and resource allocations, including additional investments in research and development and commercialization activities.
