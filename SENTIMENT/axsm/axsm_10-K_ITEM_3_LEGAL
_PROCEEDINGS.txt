ITEM 3. LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS.

Except as described herein, we, and our subsidiaries, are currently not a party to, and our property is not currently the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings; however, we may also become involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.

Securities Class Action

On May 13, 2022, Evy Gru filed a putative class action complaint captioned Gru v. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc., et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the SDNY District Court, against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and one director, which we refer to as the Securities Class Action. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false statements and omissions concerning the Company’s Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls practices, and its NDA with the FDA, with respect to one of its product candidates, AXS-07. The named plaintiff sought unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. On August 11, 2022, the SDNY District Court appointed co-lead plaintiffs in the Securities Class Action, one of whom later withdrew. On October 7, 2022, the Securities Class Action plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which contained substantially similar allegations as in the initial complaint. On September 25, 2023, the SDNY District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

On October 13, 2023, plaintiffs’ counsel filed a letter seeking leave to file an amended complaint and to substitute new plaintiffs, which defendants opposed. The SDNY District Court re-opened the lead plaintiff appointment process. Thomas Giblin, Paul Berger, and Paul Sutherland moved jointly to be appointed replacement plaintiffs. On January 22, 2024, the SDNY District Court granted that motion and ordered that the case name be changed to 
In re Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. Securities Litigation
. On January 26, 2024, the replacement plaintiffs renewed their request for leave to file a proposed second amended complaint, and, on February 6, 2024, the SDNY District Court granted that request. Plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on February 7, 2024. On March 11, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.
Shareholder Derivative Action

On July 21, 2022, Daniel Engel filed a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Engel v. Herriot Tabuteau, et al. in the SDNY District Court against the Company’s current directors, certain of the Company’s current and former officers, and the Company (as nominal defendant). On January 27, 2023, Kyle Guterba filed a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Guterba v. Tabuteau, et al. in the SDNY District Court against the Company’s current directors, certain of the Company’s current and former officers, and the Company (as nominal defendant). The derivative complaints arise out of similar allegations as those made in the Securities Class Action. The plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duties against all of the defendants and for contribution for violations of Section 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs, as well as corporate governance changes. The Engel and Guterba matters were consolidated on February 28, 2023 and are currently stayed pending further proceedings in the Securities Class

Holders

The number of record holders of our common stock as of February 11, 2025, was two. This number of holders of record does not reflect the beneficial holders of our common stock who hold shares in street name through brokerage accounts or other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. The actual number of holders of our common stock is therefore greater than this number of record holders.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and any other factors that our Board may deem relevant. In addition, the terms of our existing term loan with Hercules precludes us from paying cash dividends without the consent of Hercules, except under certain circumstances.
