ITEM 1.
BUSINESS
Introduction
Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Red Rock” or the “Company”) is a holding company that owns an indirect equity interest in and manages Station Casinos LLC (“Station LLC”), through which we conduct all of our operations. Station LLC is a gaming, development and management company established in 1976 that develops and operates strategically-located casino and entertainment properties. Station LLC owns and operates seven major gaming and entertainment facilities, including Durango Casino & Resort (“Durango”), and 12 smaller casinos (three of which are 50% owned). Durango opened in December of 2023 on approximately 50 acres of land at the intersection of Interstate 215 and Durango Drive in the southwest Las Vegas valley. The resort features approximately 533,000 square feet and includes 83,000 square feet of casino space, four full-service food and beverage outlets, a food hall, a state-of-the-art sports book and a resort-style pool
.
We own all of the outstanding voting interests in Station LLC and have an indirect equity interest in Station LLC through our ownership of limited liability interests in Station Holdco LLC (“Station Holdco,” and such interests, “LLC Units”), which owns all of the economic interests in Station LLC. At December 31, 2024, we held 58% of the economic interests and 100% of the voting power in Station Holdco, subject to certain limited exceptions, and we are designated as the sole managing member of both Station Holdco and Station LLC. We control and operate all of the business and affairs of Station Holdco and Station LLC. Other than tax-related assets and liabilities, our only assets are our equity interest in Station Holdco, our voting interest in Station LLC and a note receivable from Station LLC. We have no operations outside of our management of Station Holdco and Station LLC. 
Our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) reflect the consolidation of Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and Station Holdco. The financial position and results of operations attributable to LLC Units we do not own are reported separately as noncontrolling interest. 
Our casino properties are conveniently located throughout the Las Vegas valley and provide our customers a wide variety of entertainment and dining options. Over 90% of the Las Vegas population is located within five miles of one of our gaming facilities. We provide friendly service and exceptional value in a comfortable environment. We believe we surpass our competitors in offering casino patrons the newest and most popular slot and video games featuring the latest technology. We also believe the high-quality entertainment experience we provide our customers differentiates us from our competitors. 
Most of our major properties are master-planned for expansion, enabling us to incrementally expand our facilities as demand dictates. We also control six highly desirable gaming-entitled development sites in Las Vegas. 
Our principal source of revenue and operating income is gaming. Our non-gaming offerings include restaurants, hotels and other entertainment amenities. Approximately 80% of our casino revenue is generated from slot play. The majority of our revenue is cash-based. As a result, fluctuations in our revenues have a direct impact on our cash flows from operations. Because our business is capital intensive, we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund capital expenditures.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1505 South Pavilion Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135. The telephone number for our executive offices is (702) 495-3000. We maintain a website at www.redrockresorts.com, the contents of which are expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing.
Impact of Economic Conditions
A significant portion of our business is dependent upon customers who live and/or work in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The Las Vegas metropolitan area population continues to grow, posting a 1.9% growth rate in 2024. As of December 2024, the unemployment rate in the Las Vegas metropolitan area was 5.9%, up from 5.3% in December 2023 and 5.4% in December 2022. Statewide, the unemployment rate for December 2024 was 5.7%, as compared to 5.4% in December 2023 and 5.2% in December 2022. The median price of an existing single-family home in Las Vegas was $475,000 at December 31, 2024, up 5.6% as compared to December 31, 2023, according to the Las Vegas Realtors®. In light of uncertainty in the economic outlook stemming from inflation, higher interest rates and increased geo-political and regional conflicts, we cannot predict whether the trends in unemployment, population growth and housing prices in the Las Vegas area will continue.
Our properties have continued to experience favorable customer trends in 2024, including strong carded slot play, strong customer engagement and robust spend per visit. These positive trends, in combination with business optimization and

cost reduction measures implemented since 2020, have continued to drive strong operating results for our company. However, we cannot predict whether these trends will continue, nor can we predict the extent to which the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates on the United States and Las Vegas economies may affect our business in the future. 
Business Strategy
Our primary operating strategy emphasizes attracting and retaining customers, primarily Las Vegas residents and, to a lesser extent, out-of-town visitors. Our properties attract customers through:
•
convenient locations with best-in-class assets;
•
offering our customers the latest in slot and video poker technology;
•
a variety of non-gaming amenities such as hotel resorts, restaurants, bars and entertainment options;
•
focused marketing efforts targeting our extensive customer database;
•
innovative, frequent promotional programs; and
•
convention business.
The Las Vegas regional market is very competitive, and we compete with both large hotel casinos in Las Vegas and smaller gaming-only establishments throughout the Las Vegas valley.
Provide a high quality, value-oriented gaming and entertainment experience.  
We are committed to providing a high-value entertainment experience for our guests, as our significant level of repeat visitors demand exceptional service, variety and quality in their overall experience. We offer a broad array of gaming options, including the most popular slot and video poker products, and the latest technological innovations in slots, table games and sports wagering. We believe that providing a wide variety of entertainment options is also a significant factor in attracting guests. In particular, we feature multiple dining options at all of our major properties, which is a significant motivation for casino visits. We are dedicated to ensuring a high level of guest satisfaction and loyalty by providing attentive guest service in a convenient, friendly and casual atmosphere. As part of our commitment to providing a high-value entertainment experience and to stimulate visitation, we regularly refresh and enhance our gaming and non-gaming amenities.
Generate revenue growth through targeted marketing and promotional programs.

Our advertising programs generate consistent brand awareness and promotional visibility. Our ability to advertise under a single brand across our portfolio also allows us to achieve material economies of scale. While we advertise through traditional media such as television, radio and newspaper to reach our core guests, we continue to expand our focus and spend on social, digital and mobile platforms to respond to the evolving trends in methods through which guests receive information. 
We employ an innovative marketing strategy that utilizes our frequent promotional programs to attract and retain guests, while also establishing and maintaining a high level of brand recognition. Through our analytical approach to promotional development, we are also able to optimize reinvestment in those guests who deliver stronger results. Our proprietary customer relationship management systems are highly attuned to how guests interact with our properties and products. This information allows us to focus on targeting guests based on their preferences.
We have installed technology on all of our slot machines which permits us to provide “on device” marketing, bonusing and guest communication, including real-time customized promotions and incentives. We believe that this investment in technology has resulted in an increase in guest loyalty and enhanced the value of our loyalty program. As we continue to introduce new features and brand titles for customized promotional incentives, the technology should continue to help drive participation in our 
my|Rewards Boarding Pass
 loyalty program. 
Maximize business profitability. 
 During our over 48-year history, we have developed a culture that focuses on operational excellence and cost management. We believe that this focus has contributed to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) margins that compare favorably to our public peers over the past several years. Our analytical tools provide us with the ability to closely monitor revenues and operational expenses and provide real-time information to management. Benchmarking across our properties also allows us to create and take advantage of best practices in all functional areas of our business. We believe our existing cost structure, which has low variable costs, can support significant incremental revenue growth while maximizing the flow-through of revenue to Adjusted EBITDA.
Utilize flexible capital structure to drive growth and equityholder returns.
  We maintain a flexible capital structure that we believe allows us to pursue a balance of new growth opportunities and a disciplined return of capital to our equityholders.

We believe our scalable platform and extensive development and management expertise provide us the ability to build master-planned expansions, pursue acquisitions and/or seek new development opportunities in an effort to maximize equityholder returns.
Maintain strong employee relations.  
Station LLC began as a family-run business in 1976 and has maintained close-knit relationships among our management, and we endeavor to instill this same sense of loyalty among our employees. Toward this end, we take a hands-on approach through active and direct involvement with employees at all levels. We believe we have excellent employee relations. See 
“Human Capital”
 for more information on our employee relations. In addition, see 
Item 1A
. 
Risk Factors—Business, Economic, Market and Operating Risks—Union organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs.

Develop and operate Native American projects.
  We provide development and management services to Native American tribes using our expertise in developing and operating regional entertainment destinations. We have successfully developed and managed Native American casinos for over 20 years. Currently, we have a development agreement and a management agreement with the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians (the “Mono”) under which we will assist the Mono in developing and operating a gaming and entertainment facility (the “North Fork Project”). Construction has commenced on the site of the North Fork Project. See 
“Native American Development.”

Organizational Structure
The following chart summarizes our organizational structure as of December 31, 2024. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent all legal entities owned or controlled by us:
___________________________________________________________
(1)    Shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as a single class. Each outstanding share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote; each outstanding share of Class B common stock that is held by a holder that, together with its affiliates, owned at least 30% of the outstanding LLC Units immediately following the consummation of the Company’s public offering in 2016 (the “IPO”) and, at the applicable record date, maintains direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined on an as-exchanged basis assuming that all of the LLC Units were exchanged for Class A common stock) is entitled to ten votes; and each other outstanding share of Class B common stock is entitled

Table of Contents

to one vote. The only holders of Class B common stock that satisfy the foregoing criteria are entities controlled by Frank J. Fertitta III, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, our Vice Chairman of the Board and a Vice President. These entities are referred to herein as the “Fertitta Family Entities” or “Principal Equity Holders.” The exchange ratio for LLC Units and shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock is a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately prior to the applicable exchange and the denominator of which shall be the number of LLC Units owned by Red Rock and its subsidiaries immediately prior to applicable exchange. The initial exchange ratio at the IPO date was one share of Class A common stock for each LLC Unit and share of Class B common stock. The exchange ratio is subject to adjustment in the event that the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock does not equal the number of LLC Units held by Red Rock, including as a result of purchases of shares of Class A common stock by Red Rock with excess cash on hand that does not result in a reduction in the outstanding number of LLC Units held by Red Rock. At December 31, 2024, the exchange ratio was 0.933 shares of Class A common stock for each LLC Unit and share of Class B common stock.
(2)    “Continuing Owners” refers to the owners of LLC Units at December 31, 2024 who held such units prior to the Company’s IPO in May 2016.

Native American Development
We have entered into a Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement”) and a Third Amended and Restated Development Agreement (the “Development Agreement”), each dated November 7, 2023, with the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians (the “Mono”), a federally recognized Native American tribe located near Fresno, California, under which we will assist the Mono in developing and operating a gaming and entertainment facility (the “North Fork Project”) to be located on a 305-acre site (the “North Fork Site”) located adjacent to U.S. Highway 99 north of the city of Madera in Madera County, California. The North Fork Site was taken into trust for the benefit of the Mono by the United States Department of the Interior in February 2013. In September 2024, construction commenced on the site of the North Fork Project. We currently estimate that the North Fork Project will be completed and opened for business in approximately 15 to 18 months.

The development of the North Fork Project is subject to ongoing legal challenges and financing. There can be no assurance that the North Fork Project will be successfully completed nor that future events and circumstances will not change our estimates of the timing, scope, and potential for successful completion or that any such changes will not be material. There can be no assurance that we will recover all of our investment in the North Fork Project even if it is successfully completed and opened for business. See
