Item 1. Business—Regulation and Licensing.

The gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law, or in the administration of such law, affecting the gaming industry. The Nevada legislature meets every two years for 120 days and when special sessions are called by the Governor. The current legislative session began on February 3, 2025. There are currently no specific legislative proposals to increase taxes on gaming revenue, but there are no assurances that an increase in taxes on gaming or other revenue will not be proposed and passed by the Nevada legislature in the future.
Long-term Debt
A description of our indebtedness is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Certain accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our financial statements due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the susceptibility of such estimates and assumptions to change. We base our estimates on historical experience, information that is currently available to us and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Following is a discussion of our accounting policies that involve critical estimates and assumptions.
Long-Lived Assets 
Our business is capital intensive and a significant portion of our capital is invested in property and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets by estimating the future cash flows the asset is expected to generate, and comparing these estimated cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater, the asset is considered to be impaired, and we recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
50
Table of Contents

We test our long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level, and each of our operating properties is considered a separate reporting unit.
Inherent in the calculation of fair values are various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or asset group. We base our cash flow estimates on the current regulatory, political and economic climates in the areas where we operate, recent operating information and projections for our properties. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, changes in consumer preferences, or events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. The most significant assumptions used in determining cash flow estimates include forecasts of future operating results, Adjusted EBITDA margins, tax rates, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and terminal year free cash flows. Cash flow estimates and their impact on fair value are sensitive to changes in many of these assumptions. If our estimates of future cash flows are not met, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future. 
Property and Equipment
.  At December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of our property and equipment was approximately $2.8 billion, which represents 68.8% of our total assets. We make estimates and assumptions when accounting for property and equipment. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, and our depreciation expense is dependent on the assumptions we make about the estimated useful lives of our assets. We estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment based on our experience with similar assets and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur that change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. We must also make judgments about the capitalization of costs. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. If an asset or asset group is disposed or retired before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we may be required to accelerate our depreciation expense or recognize a loss on disposal. 
Goodwill. 
 At December 31, 2024, our goodwill totaled $195.7 million, approximately 87% of which is associated with one of our properties. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level, and we consider each of our operating properties to be a separate reporting unit.
When performing goodwill impairment testing, we either conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, or elect to bypass this qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test for impairment. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes in facts and circumstances, and make a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not the asset is impaired, we then perform a quantitative test in which the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
When performing the quantitative test, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the expected present value of future cash flows along with value indications based on our current valuation multiple and multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. The estimation of fair value requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, including estimating expected future cash flows and selecting appropriate discount rates, valuation multiples and market comparables. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce different results.
If the fair value of any of our properties with goodwill should decline in the future, we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, which could be material. A property’s fair value may decline as a result of a decrease in the property’s actual or projected operating results or changes in other assumptions and judgments used in the estimation process, including the discount rate and market multiple.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.  
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of our brands. At December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of our indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $76.5 million. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized unless management determines that their useful life is no longer indefinite. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess. We estimate the fair value of our brands using a derivation of the income approach to valuation based on the present value of estimated royalties 
51
Table of Contents

avoided through ownership of the assets. The fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to change as a result of changes in projected operating results. Accordingly, any decrease in the projected operating results of a property could require us to recognize an impairment charge, which could be material. 
Native American Development Costs.  
We incur certain costs associated with our development and management agreements with Native American tribes that are reimbursable by the tribes. The reimbursable costs are recognized as long-term assets as incurred, and primarily include advances associated with the acquisition of land and development of the tribal gaming facility. We earn interest on the reimbursable advances. The repayment of the advances and the related interest may come from the proceeds of the gaming facility’s third-party financing, from cash flows generated from the gaming facility’s operations, or from a combination of both, and the repayment is typically subordinated to debt service obligations under the gaming facility’s third-party financing. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of the repayment, we do not recognize interest on the advances until the carrying amount of the advances has been recovered and the interest is received. Accordingly, the recoverability of our development costs is highly dependent upon the tribe’s success in obtaining third-party financing and our ability to operate the project successfully upon its completion. Our evaluation of the recoverability of our Native American development costs requires us to apply a significant amount of judgment.
We evaluate the recoverability of our Native American development costs taking into consideration all available information. Among other things, we consider the status of the project, the impact of contingencies, the achievement of milestones, existing or potential litigation, and regulatory matters when evaluating the recoverability of our Native American development costs. We estimate the future cash flows of a Native American development project based on consideration of all positive and negative evidence about its cash flow potential including, but not limited to, the likelihood that the project will be successfully completed, the status of required approvals, and the status and timing of the construction of the project, as well as current and projected economic, political, regulatory and competitive conditions that may adversely impact the project’s operating results. In certain circumstances, we may discontinue funding of a project due to a revision of its expected potential, or otherwise determine that our advances are not recoverable and as a result, we may be required to write off the entire carrying amount of our advances. 
Litigation, Claims and Assessments
We are defendants in various lawsuits relating to routine matters incidental to our business and we assess the potential for any lawsuits or claims brought against us on an ongoing basis. For ongoing litigation and potential claims, we use judgment in determining the probability of loss and whether a reasonable estimate of loss, if any, can be made. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for materially different amounts than previously accrued or disclosed.
Income Taxes
We are taxed as a corporation and pay corporate federal, state and local taxes on income allocated to us by Station Holdco. Station Holdco operates as a partnership for federal, state and local tax reporting and holds 100% of the economic interests in Station LLC. The members of Station Holdco are liable for any income taxes resulting from income allocated to them by Station Holdco as a pass-through entity. 
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the book value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those amounts applicable for income tax purposes using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets represent future tax deductions or credits. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.
Each reporting period, we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we subsequently determine that there is sufficient evidence to indicate a deferred tax asset will be realized, the associated valuation allowance is reversed. On an annual basis, we perform a comprehensive analysis of all forms of positive and negative evidence based on year end results. During each interim period, we update our annual analysis for significant changes in the positive and negative evidence. 
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position, and (2) for those tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more 
52

than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We do not believe that we have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a significant liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term and short-term borrowings and we use interest rate contracts to limit cash flow variability on a portion of our variable-rate debt. Borrowings under our credit agreements bear interest at a margin above SOFR or base rate (each as defined in the credit agreements) as selected by us. The total amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate and may be reduced from time to time.
At December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of the borrowings under our credit agreements were based on variable rates, primarily SOFR, plus applicable margins of 1.50% to 2.00%, and the SOFR rates applicable to our outstanding SOFR-based borrowings were 4.36% to 4.38%. The weighted-average interest rates for variable-rate debt shown in the long-term debt table below were calculated using the rates in effect at December 31, 2024. We cannot predict the SOFR or base rate interest rates that will be in effect in the future, and actual rates will vary. Based on our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2024, an assumed 1% increase in variable interest rates would cause our annual interest cost to increase by approximately $17.1 million. A portion of our other long-term debt will become due in December 2025. 
Following is information about future principal maturities of our long-term debt and the related weighted-average contractual interest rates in effect at December 31, 2024 (dollars in millions):

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Red Rock Resorts, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Recoverability of the Native American Development Costs as of December 31, 2024
Description of the Matter 
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s Native American development costs had a carrying value of $81.7 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its Native American development costs by considering the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing, and the estimated future cash flows from the Native American development project. The Company estimates the future cash flows from the Native American development project based on an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence about the cash flow potential, which includes the likelihood that the Native American development project will successfully be completed.
Auditing the Company’s evaluation of recoverability of the Native American development costs is challenging due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and likelihood of completion of both the Native American development project and the repayment of the reimbursable advances, both of which are contingent on the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing, and the estimated future cash flows from the Native American development project.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company’s evaluation of recoverability of its Native American development costs. For example, we tested controls over management’s evaluation of the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing, and the estimated future cash flows from the Native American development project.
To test the Company’s Native American development costs recoverability evaluation, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing, and the estimated future cash flows of the Native American development project. For example, we evaluated management’s assumptions used in the estimated cash flows by performing sensitivity analysis.

RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.     
Organization and Background 
Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (“Red Rock,” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2015 to own an indirect equity interest in and manage Station Casinos LLC (“Station LLC”), a Nevada limited liability company. Station LLC is a gaming, development and management company established in 1976 that owns and operates 
seven
 major gaming and entertainment facilities, including Durango Casino & Resort (“Durango”) which opened in December 2023, and 
12
 smaller casino properties (
three
 of which are 
50
% owned), in the Las Vegas regional market. 
The Company owns all of the outstanding voting interests in Station LLC and has an indirect equity interest in Station LLC through its ownership of limited liability interests in Station Holdco LLC (“Station Holdco,” and such interests, “LLC Units”), which owns all of the economic interests in Station LLC. At December 31, 2024, the Company held 
58
% of the economic interests and 
100
% of the voting power in Station Holdco, subject to certain limited exceptions, and is designated as the sole managing member of both Station Holdco and Station LLC. The Company controls and operates all of the business and affairs of Station Holdco and Station LLC, and conducts all of its operations through these entities.
2.     
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation
Station Holdco and Station LLC are variable interest entities (“VIEs”), of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company controls and operates all of the business and affairs of Station Holdco and Station LLC and conducts all of its operations through these entities. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and Station Holdco, and presents the interests in Station Holdco not owned by Red Rock within noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities represent the assets and liabilities of Station Holdco and Station LLC, other than assets and liabilities related to income taxes and the tax receivable agreement. Investments in all 
50
% or less owned affiliated companies are accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes for previous years have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation.
Noncontrolling Interest in Station Holdco
Noncontrolling interest in Station Holdco represents the LLC Units held by certain owners who held such units prior to the Company’s 2016 initial public offering (the “IPO” and such owners, the “Continuing Owners”). Noncontrolling interest is reduced when Continuing Owners exchange their LLC Units, along with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock, for shares of Class A common stock. The noncontrolling interest holders’ ownership percentage of LLC Units is increased when LLC Units held by Red Rock are repurchased by Station Holdco, typically in connection with the Company’s repurchases of its issued and outstanding shares of its Class A common stock. Entities controlled by Frank J. Fertitta III, the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board and a vice president of the Company (the “Fertitta Family Entities”), hold 
99
% of the noncontrolling interest.
The ownership of the LLC Units is summarized as follows:        
December 31, 2024
December 31, 2023

The Company uses monthly weighted-average LLC Unit ownership to calculate the pretax income or loss of Station Holdco attributable to Red Rock and the noncontrolling interest holders. Station Holdco equity attributable to Red Rock and the noncontrolling interest holders is rebalanced, as needed, to reflect LLC Unit ownership at period end.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Measurements
For assets and liabilities accounted for or disclosed at fair value, the Company utilizes the fair value hierarchy established by the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures to categorize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels of inputs are as follows:
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides the option to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to measure any financial assets or liabilities at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value primarily because of the short maturities of these instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less.

Receivables, Net and Credit Risk
The Company’s accounts receivable primarily represent receivables from contracts with customers and consist mainly of casino, hotel, ATM, cash advance, retail and other receivables, which are typically non-interest bearing. 
Receivables are initially recorded at cost and an allowance for credit losses is maintained to reduce receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is based on an expected loss model and is estimated based on a specific review of customer accounts, historical collection experience, the age of the receivable and other relevant factors. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible, and recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $
9.1
 million and $
6.8
 million, respectively. Management believes there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to its receivables, net.
Inventories
Inventories primarily represent food and beverage items and retail merchandise which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a weighted-average basis.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is initially recorded at cost. 
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, as follows:
Buildings and improvements
10
 to 
45
 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment
3
 to 
10
 years
Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment commences when the asset is placed in service. When an asset is retired or otherwise disposed, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposal is recognized within Write-downs and other, net.
63
Table of Contents
RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company makes estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. The Company’s depreciation expense is dependent on the assumptions made for the estimated useful lives of its assets. Useful lives are estimated by the Company based on its experience with similar assets and estimates of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur that change the estimated useful life of an asset, the Company accounts for the change prospectively.
Native American Development Costs
The Company incurs certain costs associated with development and management agreements with Native American tribes that are reimbursable by such tribes. The reimbursable costs are recognized as long-term assets as incurred, and primarily include advances associated with the acquisition of land and development and construction of the tribal gaming facility. The Company earns interest on the reimbursable advances. The repayment of the advances and the related interest may come from the proceeds of the gaming facility’s third-party financing, from cash flows from the gaming facility’s operations, or from a combination of both, and the repayment is typically subordinated to debt service obligations under the gaming facility’s third-party financing. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of the repayment, the Company does not recognize accrued interest on the advances until the carrying amount of the advances has been recovered and the interest is received. 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its Native American development costs taking into consideration all available information. Among other things, the Company considers the status of the project, the impact of contingencies, the achievement of milestones, existing or potential litigation, and regulatory matters, the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing, and the estimated future cash flows from the Native American development project when evaluating the recoverability of its Native American development costs. The Company estimates the future cash flows of a Native American development project based on consideration of all positive and negative evidence about its cash flow potential including, but not limited to, the likelihood that the project will be successfully completed, the status of required approvals, and the status and timing of the construction of the project, as well as current and projected economic, political, regulatory and competitive conditions that may adversely impact the project’s operating results.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s Native American development costs were related to development and management agreements with the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians. See Note 6 for additional information.
Goodwill
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s goodwill totaled $
195.7
 million, approximately 
87
% of which is associated with one of its properties. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level, and each of the Company’s operating properties is considered a separate reporting unit.
When performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company either conducts a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, or elects to bypass this qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test for impairment. Under the qualitative assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes in facts and circumstances, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not the asset is impaired, it then performs a quantitative test in which the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
When performing the quantitative test, the Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using the expected present value of future cash flows along with value indications based on current valuation multiples of the Company and comparable publicly traded companies. The estimation of fair value involves judgment by management. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from such estimates. Cash flow estimates are based on the current regulatory, political and economic climates, recent operating information and projections. Such estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, competition, events affecting various forms of travel and access to the Company’s properties, and other factors. If the Company’s estimates of future cash flows are not met, it may have to record impairment charges in the future.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of its brands. The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. If the Company determines it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired, it 
64
Table of Contents
RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
then performs a quantitative test by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the excess. The fair value of the Company’s brands is estimated using a derivation of the income approach to valuation based on estimated royalties avoided through ownership of the assets, utilizing market indications of fair value. The Company’s fair value estimates are subject to change as a result of changes in its projected operating results. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized unless it is determined that an asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite. The Company periodically reviews its indefinite-lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset no longer has an indefinite life, the asset is tested for impairment and is subsequently accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.

Finite-lived Intangible Assets
The Company’s finite-lived intangibles primarily include assets related to its customer relationships and management contracts. The Company amortizes its finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The Company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. 
The Company’s customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with its rated casino guests. The management contract intangible assets represent the value associated with agreements under which the Company provides, or will provide, management services to various casino properties, primarily a Native American casino project that is currently under development. The Company amortizes its management contract intangible assets over their expected useful lives beginning when the property commences operations and management fees are being earned.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is evaluated by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying amount, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, impairment is measured based on the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying amount. To estimate fair values, the Company typically uses a discounted cash flow model or market comparables. The Company’s long-lived asset impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level.
The estimation of undiscounted future cash flows involves judgment by management. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or asset group are based on the current regulatory, political and economic climates, recent operating information and projections. Such estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, changes in consumer preferences, or events affecting various forms of travel and access to its properties. If the Company’s estimates of future cash flows are not met, it may be required to record impairment charges in the future.
Land Held for Development
At December 31, 2024, the Company owned land comprising strategically-located parcels in Las Vegas and Reno, each of which is zoned for casino gaming and other uses.
Debt Discounts and Debt Issuance Costs 
Debt discounts and costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the expected term of the related debt agreements. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of revolving lines of credit are presented in Other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other capitalized costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are presented as a direct reduction of Long-term debt, less current portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Leases
The Company leases certain equipment, buildings, land and other assets used in its operations. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, and determines the classification of the lease based on facts and circumstances as of the lease commencement date. For leases with an initial term greater than twelve months, the Company recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. The Company 
65
Table of Contents
RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
measures its ROU assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To calculate the present value of lease payments for leases that do not contain an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. For leases under which the Company has options to extend or terminate the lease, such options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company includes operating lease ROU assets within Other assets, net on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease liabilities are included in Other accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities. For arrangements that contain both lease and non-lease components under which the Company is the lessee, the components are not combined for accounting purposes. The Company’s leases do not include any significant residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants. 
For operating leases with fixed rental payments or variable rental payments based on an index or rate, the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For operating leases with variable payments not based on an index or rate, the Company recognizes the variable lease expense in the period in which the obligation for the payment is incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are primarily related to short-term leases for slot machines under which lease payments are based on a percentage of the revenue earned.
The Company leases space within its properties to third-party tenants, primarily food and beverage outlets and movie theaters. The Company also leases space to tenants within commercial and industrial buildings located on certain land held for development. All of the Company’s tenant leases are classified as operating leases and do not contain options for the lessee to purchase the underlying real property. Revenue from tenant leases is included in Other revenues in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
Lease payments from tenants at the Company’s properties typically include variable rent based on a percentage of the tenant’s net sales, and may also include a fixed base rent amount, which may increase by a rate or index over time. The Company recognizes variable rental income in the period in which the right to receive such rental income is established according to the lease agreements and base rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease payments from the Company’s tenants at commercial and industrial buildings are typically based on a fixed rental amount, which may increase by a rate or index over time. Revenues from non-lease components within tenant lease agreements, which primarily comprise utilities, property taxes and common area maintenance charges, are included within operating lease income.
Derivative Instruments
From time to time, the Company uses interest rate contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to interest payments. At December 31, 2024, the Company held interest rate collars that were not designated in cash flow hedging relationships. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding interest rate contracts. The Company recognizes the change in fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the change occurs and classifies the cash flows for these instruments within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company records all derivatives at fair value, which it determines using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses and credit valuation adjustments, as well as observable market-based inputs such as forward interest rate curves.
Revenues
The Company’s revenue contracts with customers consist of gaming wagers, sales of food, beverage, hotel rooms and other amenities, and agreements to provide management services. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the guest, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services, referred to as the transaction price. Other revenues also include rental income from tenants, which is recognized over the lease term, and contingent rental income, which is recognized when the right to receive such rental income is established according to the lease agreements. Revenue is recognized net of cash sales incentives and discounts and excludes sales and other taxes collected from guests on behalf of governmental authorities.
The Company accounts for its gaming and non-gaming contracts on a portfolio basis. This practical expedient is applied because individual customer contracts have similar characteristics, and the Company reasonably expects the effects on the financial statements of applying its revenue recognition policy to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying its policy to the individual contracts.
Casino Revenue
Casino revenue includes gaming activities such as slot, table game and sports wagering. The transaction price for a gaming wagering contract is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. The transaction

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
price is reduced for consideration payable to a guest, such as cash sales incentives and the change in progressive jackpot liabilities. Gaming contracts are typically completed daily based on the outcome of the wagering transaction and include a distinct performance obligation to provide gaming activities.
Guests may receive discretionary incentives for complimentary food, beverage, rooms, entertainment and merchandise to encourage additional gaming, or may earn loyalty points based on their slot play. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the gaming wagering contract. The amount allocated to loyalty points earned is based on an estimate of the standalone selling price of the loyalty points, which is determined by the redemption value less an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed. The amount allocated to discretionary complimentaries is the standalone selling price of the underlying goods or services, which is determined using the retail price at which those goods or services would be sold separately in similar transactions. The remaining amount of the transaction price is allocated to wagering activity using the residual approach as the standalone selling price for gaming wagers is highly variable and no set established price exists for gaming wagers. Amounts allocated to wagering are recognized as casino revenue when the result of the wager is determined, and amounts allocated to loyalty points and discretionary complimentaries are recognized as revenue when the goods or services are provided.
Non-gaming Revenue
Non-gaming revenue include sales of food, beverage, hotel rooms and other amenities such as retail merchandise, bowling, spa services and entertainment. The transaction price is the net amount collected from the guest and includes a distinct performance obligation to provide such goods or services. Non-gaming revenue is recognized when the goods or services are provided to the guest. Guests may also receive discretionary complimentaries that require the transaction price to be allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Non-gaming revenue also includes the portion of the transaction price from gaming or non-gaming contracts allocated to discretionary complimentaries and the value of loyalty points redeemed for food, beverage, room and other amenities. Discretionary complimentaries are classified in the departmental revenue category fulfilling the complimentary with a corresponding reduction in the departmental revenues that provided the complimentary, which is primarily casino revenue. Included in non-gaming revenues are discretionary complimentaries and loyalty point redemptions of $
199.7
 million, $
171.4
 million and $
157.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Player Rewards Program
The Company has a player rewards program (the “Rewards Program”) that allows customers to earn points based on their slot play. Guests may accumulate loyalty points over time that may be redeemed at their discretion under the terms of the Rewards Program. Loyalty points may be redeemed for cash, slot play, food, beverage, rooms, entertainment and merchandise at all of the Company’s properties.
When guests earn points under the Rewards Program, the Company recognizes a liability for future performance obligations. The Rewards Program point liability represents deferred gaming revenue, which is measured at the redemption value of loyalty points earned under the Rewards Program that management ultimately believes will be redeemed. The recognition of the Rewards Program point liability reduces casino revenue.
When points are redeemed for cash, the point liability is reduced for the amount of cash paid out. When points are redeemed for slot play, food, beverage, rooms, entertainment and merchandise, revenues are recognized when the goods or services are provided, and such revenues are classified based on the type of goods or services provided with a corresponding reduction to the point liability.
The Company’s performance obligation related to its loyalty point liability is generally completed within one year, as a guest’s loyalty point balance is forfeited after six months of inactivity for a local guest and after thirteen months for an out-of-town guest, as defined in the Rewards Program. Loyalty points are generally earned and redeemed continually over time. As a result, the loyalty point liability balance remains relatively constant. The loyalty point liability is presented within Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Slot Machine Jackpots
The Company does not accrue base jackpots if it is not legally obligated to pay the jackpot. A jackpot liability is accrued with a related reduction in casino revenue when the Company is obligated to pay the jackpot, such as the incremental amount in excess of the base jackpot on a progressive game.

Share-based Compensation
The Company measures its share-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes the cost over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the closing share price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The Company uses the straight-line method to recognize compensation cost for share-based awards with graded service-based vesting, and cumulative compensation cost recognized to date at least equals the grant-date fair value of the vested portion of the awards. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income Taxes
Red Rock is taxed as a corporation and pays corporate federal, state and local taxes on income allocated to it by Station Holdco. Station Holdco operates as a partnership for federal, state and local tax reporting and holds 
100
% of the economic interests in Station LLC. The members of Station Holdco are liable for any income taxes resulting from income allocated to them by Station Holdco as a pass-through entity. 
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the book value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those amounts applicable for income tax purposes using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company classifies all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Deferred tax assets represent future tax deductions or credits. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.
Each reporting period, the Company analyzes the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If the Company subsequently determines that there is sufficient evidence to indicate a deferred tax asset will be realized, the associated valuation allowance is reversed. On an annual basis, the Company performs a comprehensive analysis of all forms of positive and negative evidence based on year end results. During each interim reporting period, the Company updates its annual analysis for significant changes in the positive and negative evidence. 
The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company does not believe that it has any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that it will be required to record a significant liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

As applicable, the Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes through the provision for income taxes.

Tax Receivable Agreement
In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) with certain pre-IPO owners of Station Holdco. In the event that such parties exchange any or all of their LLC Units for Class A common stock, the TRA requires the Company to make payments to such parties for 
85
% of the tax benefits realized by the Company by such exchange. The annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. When an exchange transaction occurs, the Company initially recognizes the related TRA liability through a charge to equity, and any subsequent adjustments to the liability are recorded through the Consolidated Statements of Income.
As a result of exchanges of LLC Units for Class A common stock and purchases by the Company of LLC Units from holders of such units, the Company is entitled to a proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of Station Holdco at the time of such exchanges or purchases. In addition, such exchanges or purchases of LLC Units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Station Holdco that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that the Company would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. 
The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Company generates each year, the tax rate then applicable and amortizable basis. If the Company does not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, it would not be required to make the related TRA payments. The Company will only recognize a liability for TRA payments if management determines it is probable that it will generate sufficient future taxable income over the term of the TRA to utilize the related tax benefits. If management determines in the future that the Company will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, it would derecognize the portion of the liability related to the benefits not expected to be utilized. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers its historical results and incorporates certain assumptions, including revenue growth and operating margins, among others.
The payment obligations under the TRA are Red Rock’s obligations and are not obligations of Station Holdco or Station LLC. Payments are generally due within a specified period of time following the filing of the Company’s annual tax return and interest on such payments will accrue from the original due date (without extensions) of the income tax return until the date paid. Payments not made within the required period after the filing of the income tax return generally accrue interest.
The TRA will remain in effect until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA. The TRA will also terminate if the Company breaches its obligations under the TRA or upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. If the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA, or if the TRA is terminated early in accordance with its terms, the Company’s payment obligations would be accelerated based upon certain assumptions, including the assumption that it would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize such tax benefits, and may substantially exceed the actual benefits, if any, the Company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.
Additionally, the Company estimates the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next twelve months and classifies this amount within current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. This determination is based on management’s estimate of taxable income for the next fiscal year. To the extent the Company’s estimate differs from actual results, it may be required to reclassify portions of the liability under the TRA between current and non-current.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Red Rock by the weighted-average number of Class A shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Red Rock, including the impact of potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted-average number of Class A shares outstanding during the period, including the number of Class A shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include the outstanding Class B common stock, outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock. The Company uses the “if-converted” method to determine the potentially dilutive

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses as well as additional expanded segment-related disclosures, and requires such disclosures on both an interim and annual basis. The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim and annual periods thereafter and is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the adoption did not have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The ASU is intended to provide more transparency of income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures, primarily rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not anticipate that this ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE). The ASU is intended to improve disclosures of expenses and requires disclosure of specific expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as selling expenses. The guidance is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance and its impact to the financial statements.

Asset Impairment
The Company reviews the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company’s long-lived asset impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, and each of its operating properties is considered a separate reporting unit.
 In June 2022, the Company permanently closed its Texas Station, Fiesta Henderson and Fiesta Rancho properties, which had been closed since March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to permanently close these properties was an indicator of impairment. The Company tested each of these reporting units for impairment as of June 30, 2022 and recorded asset impairment charges totaling $
79.0
 million, primarily representing the write-off of the facilities that were being demolished in whole or in part. The recoverability of the carrying amounts of the remaining assets, primarily land,

was evaluated based on market prices for similar assets, which are considered Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company also recognized an asset impairment charge of $

 million as a result of the permanent closure of its Wild Wild West property in September 2022. In December 2022, the Company sold the Fiesta Henderson parcel to a third-party buyer for $

Native American Development
The Company, the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians (the “Mono”), a federally recognized Native American tribe located near Fresno, California and the North Fork Rancheria Economic Development Authority (the “Authority”) have entered into a Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement”) and a Third Amended and Restated Development Agreement (the “Development Agreement”), each dated as of November 7, 2023. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the Company has assisted and will assist the Mono and the Authority in developing a gaming and entertainment facility (the “North Fork Project”) to be located in Madera County, California. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Company will assist the Mono and the Authority in operating the North Fork Project. The Company purchased a 
305
-acre parcel of land adjacent to Highway 99 north of the city of Madera (the “North Fork Site”), which was taken into trust for the benefit of the Mono by the Department of the Interior (“DOI”) in February 2013.
As currently contemplated, the North Fork Project is expected to include approximately 
2,000
 Class III slot machines and additional Class II slot machines, approximately 
42
 table games and several restaurants. Total costs of the project are expected to be approximately $
750
 million which includes all design costs, construction costs, preopening expenses and financing and development fees. The following table summarizes the Company’s evaluation at December 31, 2024 of those critical milestones that it has identified to date as necessary to complete the North Fork Project. As of January 5, 2024, the date the Mono received the approval of the Management Agreement from the Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”), the Company believes that each of these identified critical milestones has substantially been resolved. There is no assurance that these critical milestones will remain resolved or that additional critical milestones will not be identified.

The following table summarizes the Company’s evaluation at December 31, 2024 of each of the critical milestones necessary to complete the North Fork Project.
Federally recognized as an Indian tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”)
Yes
Date of recognition
Federal recognition was terminated in 1966 and restored in 1983. 
Tribe has possession of or access to usable land upon which the project is to be built
The DOI accepted approximately 
305
 acres of land for the project into trust for the benefit of the Mono in February 2013.
Status of obtaining regulatory and governmental approvals:
Tribal-state compact
A compact was negotiated and signed by the Governor of California and the Mono in August 2012. The California State Assembly and Senate passed Assembly Bill 277 (“AB 277”) which ratified the Compact in May 2013 and June 2013, respectively. Opponents of the North Fork Project qualified a referendum, “Proposition 48,” for a state-wide ballot challenging the legislature’s ratification of the Compact. In November 2014, Proposition 48 failed. The State took the position that the failure of Proposition 48 nullified the ratification of the Compact and, therefore, the Compact did not take effect under California law. In March 2015, the Mono filed suit against the State to obtain a compact with the State or procedures from the Secretary of the Interior under which Class III gaming may be conducted on the North Fork Site. In July 2016, the DOI issued Secretarial procedures (the “Secretarial Procedures”) pursuant to which the Mono may conduct Class III gaming on the North Fork Site.
Approval of gaming compact by DOI
The Compact was submitted to the DOI in July 2013. In October 2013, notice of the Compact taking effect was published in the Federal Register. The Secretarial Procedures supersede and replace the Compact. 
Record of decision regarding environmental impact published by BIA
In November 2012, the record of decision for the Environmental Impact Statement for the North Fork Project was issued by the BIA. In December 2012, the Notice of Intent to take land into trust was published in the Federal Register.
BIA accepting usable land into trust on behalf of the tribe
The North Fork Site was accepted into trust in February 2013.
Approval of management agreement by NIGC
In December 2015, the Mono submitted a Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement, and certain related documents, to the NIGC. In July 2016, the Mono received a deficiency letter from the NIGC seeking additional information concerning the Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement. In March 2018, the Mono submitted the Management Agreement and certain related documents to the NIGC. In June 2018, the Mono received a deficiency letter from the NIGC seeking additional information concerning the Management Agreement. In April 2021, the Mono received an issues letter from the NIGC identifying issues to be addressed prior to approval of the Management Agreement. In September 2022, the Mono received an additional issues letter from the NIGC identifying remaining issues to be addressed prior to approval of the Management Agreement. Following dialogue with the NIGC, the Mono submitted executed North Fork Project agreements to the NIGC in November, 2023. On January 5, 2024, the Chairman of the NIGC approved the Management Agreement.
Gaming licenses:
Type
The North Fork Project will include the operation of Class II and Class III gaming, which are allowed pursuant to the terms of the Secretarial Procedures and the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (“IGRA”), following approval of the Management Agreement by the NIGC.
Number of gaming devices allowed
The Secretarial Procedures allow for the operation of a maximum of 
2,000
 Class III slot machines at the facility during the first two years of operation and thereafter up to 2,500 Class III slot machines. There is no limit on the number of Class II gaming devices that the Mono can offer.
Agreements with local authorities
The Mono has entered into memoranda of understanding with the City of Madera, the County of Madera and the Madera Irrigation District under which the Mono agreed to pay one-time and recurring mitigation contributions, subject to certain contingencies. The memoranda of understanding have all been amended to restructure the timing of certain payments due to delays in the development of the North Fork Project.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In addition to the critical milestones, there is a remaining unresolved legal matter related to the North Fork Project.
In March 2016, Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians (“Picayune”) filed a complaint for declaratory relief and petition for writ of mandate in California Superior Court for the County of Madera against Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., alleging that the referendum that invalidated the Compact also invalidated Governor Brown’s concurrence with the Secretary of the Interior’s determination that gaming on the North Fork Site would be in the best interest of the Mono and not detrimental to the surrounding community. The complaint seeks to vacate and set aside the Governor’s concurrence and was stayed from December 2016 to September 2021, when the Supreme Court of California denied the Mono’s and the State of California’s petition for review in Stand Up for California! v. Brown. As a result of the denial, litigation of this matter has resumed and a first amended complaint was filed by Picayune in December 2022. Each of the State of California and the Mono filed demurrers challenging the first amended complaint; in July 2023, the State of California’s demurrer was granted and the Mono’s demurrer was denied. The Mono has answered the first amended complaint and each of the Mono and Picayune have filed motions for summary judgment, which motions are fully briefed. In May 2024, the Superior Court of California granted Picayune’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Mono’s motion for summary judgment. Picayune has appealed the grant of the State of California’s demurrer and the Mono have appealed the grant of Picayune’s motion for summary judgment. The appeals have been consolidated and the briefing of the appeals is scheduled to be completed by May 29, 2025.
Under the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company has agreed to arrange the financing for the ongoing development costs and construction of the facility, and has contributed significant financial support to the North Fork Project. Through December 31, 2024, the Company has paid approximately $
96.8
 million of reimbursable advances to the Mono, primarily to complete the environmental impact study, purchase the North Fork Site and pay the costs of litigation and construction. The repayment of the advances is expected to come from the proceeds of the North Fork Project’s financing, from cash flows from the North Fork Project’s operations, or from a combination of both. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, accrued interest on the advances will not be recognized in income until the carrying amount of the advances has been recovered. The carrying amount of the reimbursable advances was reduced by $
15.1
 million to fair value upon the Company’s adoption of fresh-start reporting in 2011. At December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the advances was $
81.7
 million.
In addition to the reimbursable advances, the Company expects to receive a development fee of 
4
% of the costs of construction for its development services, which will be paid upon the commencement of gaming operations at the facility. The proposed management agreement provides for the Company to receive a management fee of 
30
% of the North Fork Project’s net income. The repayment of all or a portion of the reimbursable advances is anticipated to be subordinated to the Mono’s debt service obligations under the North Fork Project’s financing. The Management Agreement has a term of 
seven
 years from the opening of the North Fork Project. The Management Agreement includes termination provisions whereby either party may terminate the agreement for cause, and may also be terminated at any time upon agreement of the parties. There is no provision in the Management Agreement allowing the tribe to buy-out the agreement prior to its expiration. The Management Agreement provides that the Company will train the Mono tribal members such that they may assume responsibility for managing the North Fork Project upon the expiration of the agreement. 
The Company expects that upon termination or expiration of the Development Agreement, the Mono will continue to be obligated to repay any unpaid principal and interest on the advances from the Company. Amounts due to the Company under the Development Agreement and Management Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the North Fork Project except the North Fork Site. In addition, each of the Development Agreement and the Management Agreement contains waivers of the Mono’s sovereign immunity from suit for the purpose of enforcing the agreements or permitting or compelling arbitration and other remedies.
The timing of both the North Fork Project and of the repayment of the reimbursable advances is difficult to predict and is contingent on no changes occurring with respect to the status of the identified critical milestones, no new critical milestones being identified, the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of expected financing of the North Fork Project, and the cash flows from the North Fork Project. In September 2024 construction commenced on the site of the North Fork Project. The Company currently estimates that the North Fork Project will be completed and opened for business in approximately 
15
 to 
18
 months. The Company is assisting the Mono in obtaining financing for the North Fork Project.
The Company has evaluated the likelihood that the North Fork Project will be successfully completed and opened, and has concluded that the likelihood of successful completion is in the range of 
80
% to 
90
% at December 31, 2024. The Company’s evaluation is based on its consideration of all available positive and negative evidence about the status of the North Fork Project, including, but not limited to, the status of required regulatory approvals, no changes with respect to the status of the identified critical milestones, no new critical milestones being identified, the likelihood of obtaining and the amount of

expected financing, and cash flows from the North Fork Project and the status of any remaining litigation and contingencies. There can be no assurance that all the necessary governmental and regulatory approvals will be obtained, that the status of the existing critical milestones will not change, that new critical milestones will not be identified, that financing will be obtained, that the financing and/or the cash flows from the North Fork Project will be sufficient to repay the advances, that the North Fork Project will be successfully completed or that future events and circumstances will not change the Company’s estimates of the timing, scope, and potential for successful completion or that any such changes will not be material. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will recover all of its investment in the North Fork Project even if it is successfully completed and opened for business.

Customer contract liabilities related to future performance obligations consist of the Rewards Program liability, advance deposits on goods or services yet to be provided and wagers for future sporting events. Advance deposits and wagers for future sporting events represent cash payments received from guests that are typically recognized in revenues within one year from the date received. The Company also has other customer-related liabilities that primarily include unpaid wagers and outstanding chips. Unpaid wagers include unredeemed gaming tickets that are exchanged for cash, and outstanding chips represent amounts owed to guests in exchange for gaming chips in their possession that may be redeemed for cash or recognized as revenue. Fluctuations in contract liabilities and other customer-related liabilities are typically a result of normal operating activities. The Company had 
no
 material contract assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Credit Facility
At December 31, 2024, Station LLC’s credit facility consists of the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”). On March 14, 2024, Station LLC entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the existing credit agreement and pursuant to which the Company repaid all loans outstanding under the existing credit agreement and (a) incurred (i) a new senior secured term “B” loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
1.57
 billion (the “New Term Loan B Facility” and the term “B” loans funded thereunder, the “New Term B Loan”) and (ii) a new senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
1.1
 billion (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”), and (b) made certain other amendments to the existing credit agreement, including the extinguishment of the existing term loan “A” facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 14, 2029, and the New Term Loan B Facility will mature on March 14, 2031.
Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at Station LLC’s option, equal to either the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate term (“Term SOFR”) or a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (ii) the administrative agent’s “prime rate” and (iii) the one-month Term SOFR rate plus 
1.00
%, in each case plus an applicable margin. 
On December 18, 2024, Station LLC entered into the first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) to reduce the interest rate margins applicable to the Company’s existing New Term Loan B Facility. Such applicable margin is 
2.00
% per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 
1.00
% in the case of any base rate loan. Prior to the Amendment, the New Term Loan B Facility applicable margin was 
2.25
% per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 
1.25
% in the case of any base rate loan.

Station LLC is required to make quarterly principal payments of $
3.9
 million on the New Term Loan B Facility on the last day of each quarter, unless otherwise reduced by prepayments. Station LLC also is required to make mandatory payments of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility with the proceeds of certain casualty events, debt issuances and asset sales and, depending on its consolidated total leverage ratio, Station LLC is required to apply a portion of its excess cash flow to repay amounts outstanding under the New Term Loan B Facility, which would reduce future quarterly principal payments. The Company is not required to make an excess cash flow payment for 2024.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of Station LLC’s existing and future material restricted subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of all of the equity interests in Station LLC and its material restricted subsidiaries, a security interest in substantially all of the personal property of Station LLC and the subsidiary guarantors, and mortgages on the real property and improvements owned or leased by certain of Station LLC’s subsidiaries.
The Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Station LLC and the subsidiary guarantors to incur debt; create liens; engage in mergers and acquisitions, or non-ordinary asset dispositions; pay distributions; pay dividends, make stock repurchases and optional redemptions of subordinated debt; make investments or loans; engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries; modify their lines of business; or change the fiscal year.
The Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants, including requirements that Station LLC maintains throughout the term of such facility and measured as of the end of each quarter, a maximum total secured leverage ratio of 
5.00
 to 1.00. A breach of the financial ratio covenants shall only become an event of default if not cured and a Covenant Facility Acceleration has occurred. Management believes the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2024. 
At December 31, 2024, Station LLC’s borrowing availability under its New Revolving Credit Facility, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the Credit Facility, was $
897.7
 million, which was net of $
155.0
 million in outstanding borrowings and $
47.3
 million in outstanding letters of credit and similar obligations. 
6.625% Senior Notes
On March 14, 2024, Station LLC issued $
500.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
6.625

6.625
% Senior Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 14, 2024, among Station LLC, the guarantors party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The net proceeds of the sale of the 
6.625
% Senior Notes together with the borrowings under the New Term B Loan were used (i) to refinance all loans and commitments outstanding under the existing credit facility, (ii) to pay fees and costs associated with such transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 
6.625
% Senior Notes is paid every six months in arrears on March 15 and September 15, which commenced on September 15, 2024. 
The 
6.625
% Senior Notes and the guarantees of such notes by certain of Station LLC’s subsidiaries are general senior unsecured obligations.

Derivative Instruments
The Company’s objective in using derivative instruments is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements associated with its variable interest rate debt. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate contracts as a primary part of its cash flow hedging strategy. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
On April 9, 2024, Station LLC entered into two zero cost interest rate collar agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $
750
 million. Both interest rate collars became effective in April 2024 and include a Term SOFR cap of 
5.25
% and a weighted average Term SOFR floor of 
2.89
% and will mature in April 2029. Monthly cash settlements are received from or paid to the counterparties when interest rates rise above or fall below the contractual cap or floor rates, respectively. The interest rate collars are not designated in hedging relationships for accounting purposes.
The Company records all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, which it determines using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including forward interest rate curves. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The Company does not offset derivative asset and liability positions when interest rate contracts are held with the same counterparty. 
As the Company’s derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships, the changes in fair value and the related pretax gains and losses are recognized in Change in fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the change occurs. The Company recognizes cash settlements received or paid, if any, on the derivative instruments within Change in fair value of derivative instruments and classifies such cash flows within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Station LLC has not posted any collateral related to its interest rate collars; however, its obligations under the interest rate collars are subject to the security and guarantee arrangements applicable to the Credit Facility. The interest rate collar agreements contain cross-default provisions under which Station LLC could be declared in default on its obligations under such agreements if certain conditions of default exist on the Credit Facility.

Fair Value Measurements
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s only financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were its interest rate collars. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

0.01
 per share and 
100,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock, par value $

 shares of preferred stock, par value of $

none
 of which have been issued. The holders of the Company’s Class A common stock hold 
100
% of the economic interests in the Company.
Class A Common Stock
Voting Rights
The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Holders of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the Company’s stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
Dividend Rights and Distributions
Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, the holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of Class A common stock will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and it may increase, reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. The board of directors may take into account general economic and business conditions, the Company’s financial condition and operating results, its available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends to stockholders or the payment of distributions by subsidiaries (including Station Holdco) to the Company, and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant. 
Red Rock is a holding company. Other than a note receivable from Station LLC and assets and liabilities related to income taxes and the tax receivable agreement, its only material assets are its equity interest in Station Holdco and its voting interest in Station LLC. Red Rock has no operations outside of its management of Station LLC. The Company intends to cause Station Holdco to make distributions in an amount sufficient to cover cash dividends declared, if any. If Station Holdco makes such distributions to Red Rock, the other holders of LLC Units will be entitled to receive proportionate distributions based on their percentage ownership of Station Holdco. 
The existing debt agreements of Station LLC, including those governing the Credit Facility, contain restrictive covenants that limit its ability to make cash distributions. Because the only asset of Station Holdco is its interest in Station LLC, the limitations on such distributions will effectively limit the ability of Station Holdco to make distributions to Red Rock, and any financing arrangements that the Company or any of its subsidiaries enter into in the future may contain similar restrictions. Station Holdco is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Station Holdco (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of Station Holdco, including Station LLC and its subsidiaries, are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to their members or equityholders. Because the Company must pay taxes and make payments under the TRA, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of Class A common stock may be less than the amounts distributed by Station Holdco to its members on a per LLC Unit basis.

Other Rights
The holders of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of Class A common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future.
Equity Repurchase Program
On May 2, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized the extension of the $
600.0
 million equity repurchase program for repurchases of Class A common stock through December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 
7.3
 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the program, and the remaining amount authorized for repurchases was $
309.0
 million. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any shares under this program. Subject to applicable laws and the provisions of any agreements restricting the Company’s ability to do so, repurchases may be made at the Company’s discretion from time to time through open market purchases, negotiated transactions or tender offers, depending on market conditions and other factors. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
75,000
 shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $
3.9
 million in open market transactions. The Company made 
no
 repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2023 under the program. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 
3.7
 million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $
141.5
 million in open market transactions. The Class A shares were retired upon repurchase. 
Class B Common Stock
Voting Rights
The Continuing Owners of Station Holdco hold shares of Class B common stock in an amount equal to the number of LLC Units owned. Although Class B shares have no economic rights, they allow those owners of Station Holdco to exercise voting power at Red Rock, which is the sole managing member of Station Holdco.

RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Each outstanding share of Class B common stock that is held by a holder that, together with its affiliates, owned LLC Units representing at least 
30
% of the outstanding LLC Units following the IPO and, at the applicable record date, maintains direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 
10
% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined on an as-exchanged basis assuming that all of the LLC Units were exchanged for Class A common stock) is entitled to 
ten
 votes and each other outstanding share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote.
The Fertitta Family Entities hold all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock that have ten votes per share. As a result, Frank J. Fertitta III and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, together with their affiliates, control any action requiring the general approval of the Company’s stockholders, including the election of the board of directors, the adoption of amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets.
Holders of LLC Units are entitled at any time to exchange LLC Units, together with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock, for shares of Class A common stock or for cash, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, as members of Station Holdco entitled to ten votes per share exchange LLC Units, the voting power afforded to them by their shares of Class B common stock will be correspondingly reduced. Exchanges of LLC Units and shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock are based on an exchange ratio. The exchange ratio is a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately prior to the applicable exchange and the denominator of which is the number of LLC Units owned by Red Rock and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the applicable exchange. The initial exchange ratio at the IPO date was one share of Class A common stock for each LLC Unit and share of Class B common stock. The exchange ratio is subject to adjustment in the event that the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock does not equal the number of LLC Units held by Red Rock. At December 31, 2024, the exchange ratio was 
0.933
 shares of Class A common stock for each LLC Unit and share of Class B common stock. No shares of Class B common stock were exchanged for Class A shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Automatic Transfer
In the event that any outstanding share of Class B common stock shall cease to be held by a holder of an LLC Unit (including a transferee of an LLC Unit), such share shall automatically be transferred to the Company and thereupon shall be retired.
Dividend Rights
Class B stockholders will not participate in any dividends declared by the board of directors.
Rights upon Liquidation
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of Red Rock, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Class B stockholders will not be entitled to receive any of the Company’s assets.
Other Rights
The holders of Class B common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class B common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of Class B common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future.
Preferred Stock
Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and the Certificate of Incorporation, the board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock and to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the shares. The board of directors is authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. The Company has no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Share-based Compensation 
The Red Rock Resorts, Inc. 2016 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) is designed to attract, retain and motivate employees and to align the interests of those individuals with the interests of the Company. The Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders and is administered by the compensation committee or other designated committee of the board of directors (the “Committee”). The Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the Committee to grant share-based compensation awards, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, stock appreciation rights and certain other stock-based awards, to eligible participants. The Committee may designate plan participants, determine the types of awards to be granted and the number of shares covered by awards, and set the terms and conditions of awards, subject to limitations set forth in the plan. At December 31, 2024, a total of 
23.8
 million shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the plan, of which approximately 
12.5
 million shares were available to be issued. 
Stock Options
Stock option awards issued under the plan generally vest over a requisite service period of 
four years
 and have a term of 
seven years
 from the grant date. The exercise price of stock options awarded under the plan is equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the grant date.

The Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes model. 
The weighted- average assumptions used by the Company were as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
2024

4.2
%
3.9
%
2.1
%
Expected dividend yield
2.1
%
2.4
%
2.2
%
The Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected term of stock option awards as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base its estimate. The expected volatility assumption is estimated based on the Company’s historical stock price volatility for a period equal to the expected term of the award. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the date of grant for a period equal to the award’s expected term. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current annualized dividend as of the grant date and its average daily stock price for the year preceding the option grant.
At December 31, 2024, unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to stock options was $
34.9
 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.4
 years.
Restricted Stock Awards

As a result of the Company’s IPO in 2016 and certain reorganization transactions, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset resulting from the outside basis difference of its interest in Station Holdco. The Company also recorded a deferred tax asset for its liability related to payments to be made pursuant to the TRA representing 
85
% of the tax savings the Company expects to realize from the amortization deductions associated with the step up in the basis of depreciable assets under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to tax attributes including net operating losses, interest limitations and capital losses. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no material net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
99.2
 million of federal U.S. interest limitation carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
4.2
 million of federal U.S. capital loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2026.
The Company considers both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in management’s judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. 
Historically, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on the portion of the deferred tax asset for its investment in Station Holdco that would not be realized unless the Company disposes of its investment in Station Holdco. As of each reporting date, the Company considers new evidence that could impact the assessment of the future realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded 
no
 valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets. 
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company recorded $
1.8
 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024. The Company recorded interest of $
0.2
 million and $
0.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company did not record interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits for prior periods, as any recognition would have resulted in a reduction of its net operating loss or other tax attributes and would not have resulted in the underpayment of tax. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the provision for income taxes. The Company does not believe that it has any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that it will be required to record a significant liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

RED ROCK RESORTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company files annual income tax returns for Red Rock and Station Holdco in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has concluded its examination of Red Rock for the 2016 tax year and its examination of Station Holdco for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from any examinations to determine the adequacy of the Company’s provision for income taxes. The results of the 2016 and 2017 agreed audit adjustments were reflected as a reduction in carryforward net operating losses during the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2024, the Company came to a final agreement with the IRS on the 2017 federal tax year examination and made a deposit equal to what the Company expects to owe. No net liability remains on the balance sheet.
There are no other ongoing income tax audits as of December 31, 2024. For federal income tax purposes, the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 are subject to examination as the normal three-year statute of limitations would expire three years after the actual filing date of the returns.

Tax Receivable Agreement
Pursuant to the election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company continues to expect to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Station Holdco when LLC Units are exchanged by Station Holdco’s noncontrolling interest holders and other qualifying transactions. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. The Company expects to realize these tax benefits based on current projections of taxable income.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no exchanges of LLC Units and Class B common shares for Class A common stock. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s liability under the TRA with respect to previously consummated transactions was $
20.4
 million and $
22.1
 million, respectively, which is due primarily to current and former executives of the Company or members of their respective family group. Of these amounts, $
5.6
 million is payable to Fertitta Family Entities. Future payments to the pre-IPO owners in respect of any subsequent exchanges of LLC Units and Class B common shares for Class A common stock would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial.
15.     
401(k) Plan
The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan that covers all employees who meet certain age and length of service requirements and allows an employer contribution of up to 
50
% of the first 
4
% of each participating employee’s compensation contributed to the plan. Participants may elect to defer pretax compensation through payroll deductions, which are regulated under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and may also make after-tax contributions. The plan allows for a discretionary employer contribution for all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements, including a maximum annual salary threshold. Employer matching and discretionary contribution expense was $
9.0
 million, $
8.8
 million and $
9.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included discretionary contributions of $

5.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings or loss per share is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to Red Rock by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings or loss per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive shares, including shares issuable pursuant to outstanding stock options and nonvested restricted shares of Class A common stock, based on the application of the treasury stock method, and outstanding Class B common stock that is exchangeable, along with an equal number of LLC Units, for Class A common stock, based on the application of the if-converted method.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits relating to routine matters incidental to their business. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of any legal matters and litigation inherently involves significant risks. The Company does not believe there are any legal matters outstanding that would have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
19.    
Segments
The Company views each of its Las Vegas casino properties and each of its Native American management arrangements as an individual operating segment. The Company aggregates all of its Las Vegas properties into 
one
 reportable segment because all of the properties offer similar products, cater to the same customer base, have the same regulatory and tax structure, share the same marketing techniques, are directed by a centralized management structure and have similar economic characteristics. The Company also aggregates its Native American management arrangements into 
one
 reportable segment.
The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company utilizes adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") as its primary performance measure. The CODM uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was performed using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included below. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Red Rock Resorts, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Red Rock Resorts, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated  February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
