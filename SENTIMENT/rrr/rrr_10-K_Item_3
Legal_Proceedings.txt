MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market Information 
Our Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “RRR”. The declaration, amount and payment of dividends on shares of Class A common stock are at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to legally available funds.
Dividends 
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.00 per share to Class A common stockholders. In addition, in March 2024, we paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share to Class A common stockholders. 
On February 11, 2025, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of Class A common stock, to be paid on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of March 17, 2025.
The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of Class A common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about dividends.
Holders 
At February 14, 2025, there were 12 holders of record of our Class A common stock, although we believe there are a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our Class A common stock because many shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased shares of Class A common stock which were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock. The following table provides information with respect to purchases by the Company of shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2024.

ITEM 6.    [RESERVED]
ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in 
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Red Rock was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2015 to own an indirect equity interest in, and manage, Station Casinos LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Station LLC”). Station LLC is a gaming, development and management company established in 1976 that owns and operates seven major gaming and entertainment facilities and 12 smaller casinos (three of which are 50% owned) in the Las Vegas regional market. In December 2023, we opened Durango Casino & Resort (“Durango”). As of December 31, 2024, we offered 16,447 slot machines, 320 table games and 3,030 hotel rooms in the Las Vegas market. 
We own all of the outstanding voting interests in Station LLC and have an indirect equity interest in Station LLC through our ownership of limited liability company interests in Station Holdco (“LLC Units”), which owns all of the economic interests in Station LLC. At December 31, 2024, we held 58% of the economic interests and 100% of the voting power in Station Holdco, subject to certain limited exceptions, and we are designated as the sole managing member of both Station Holdco and Station LLC. We control and operate all of the business and affairs of Station Holdco and Station LLC, and conduct all of our operations through these entities. Other than assets and liabilities related to income taxes and the tax receivable agreement, our only material assets are our equity interest in Station Holdco, our voting interest in Station LLC and a note receivable from Station LLC. We have no operations outside of our management of Station Holdco and Station LLC.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidation of Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, and Station Holdco. The financial position and results of operations attributable to LLC Units we do not own are reported separately as noncontrolling interest. 
Our principal source of revenue and operating income is gaming. Our non-gaming offerings include restaurants, hotels and other entertainment amenities. Approximately 80% of our casino revenue is generated from slot play. The majority of our revenue is cash-based and, as a result, fluctuations in our revenues have a direct impact on our cash flows from operations. Because our business is capital intensive and we utilize debt to fund many of our capital initiatives, we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund capital expenditures.
A significant portion of our business is dependent upon customers who live and/or work in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. As of December 2024, the unemployment rate in the Las Vegas metropolitan area was 5.9%, up from 5.3% in December 2023. Statewide, the unemployment rate for December 2024 was 5.7%, as compared to 5.4% in December 2023. The median price of an existing single-family home in Las Vegas was $475,000 at December 31, 2024, up 5.6% as compared to December 31, 2023, according to the Las Vegas Realtors®. In addition, the Las Vegas metropolitan area population continues to grow, posting a 1.9% growth rate in 2024 over the prior year. In light of uncertainty in the economic outlook stemming from inflation, higher interest rates, increased geo-political and regional conflicts, and the current administration’s view of the regulatory environment and agencies, we cannot predict whether the trends in unemployment, housing prices or population growth in the Las Vegas area will continue.
We have continued to experience favorable customer trends, including strong carded slot play, strong customer engagement and robust spend per visit across the majority of our properties. These trends, in combination with our operational discipline and our focus on our core local guests, as well as regional and out of town guests, continued to drive consistent operating results in 2024. However, we cannot predict whether these trends will continue, nor can we predict the extent to which the impacts of inflation and interest rate fluctuations may affect our business in the future.

Our Key Performance Indicators
We use certain key indicators to measure our performance.
Gaming revenue measures:
•
Slot handle, table game drop and race and sports write are measures of volume. Slot handle represents the dollar amount wagered in slot machines, and table game drop represents the total amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in table game drop boxes. 
•
Win represents the amount of wagers retained by us.
•
Hold represents win as a percentage of slot handle, table game drop or race and sports write.
As our customers are primarily Las Vegas residents, our hold percentages are generally consistent from period to period. Fluctuations in our casino revenue are primarily due to the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties.
Food and beverage revenue measures:
•
Average guest check is a measure of food sales volume and product offerings at our restaurants, and represents the average amount spent per customer visit. 
•
Number of guests served is an indicator of volume.
Room revenue measures:
•
Occupancy is calculated by dividing occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by rooms available.
•
Average daily rate (“ADR”) is calculated by dividing room revenue, which includes the retail value of complimentary rooms, by rooms occupied, including complimentary rooms.
•
Revenue per available room is calculated by dividing room revenue by rooms available.

We view each of our Las Vegas casino properties as an individual operating segment. We aggregate all of our Las Vegas operating segments into one reportable segment because all of our Las Vegas properties offer similar products, cater to the same customer base, have the same regulatory and tax structure, share the same marketing programs, are directed by a centralized management structure and have similar economic characteristics. We also aggregate our Native American management activities into one reportable segment. There was no Native American management activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations of our Las Vegas operations are discussed in the remaining sections below.

Net Revenues.  
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $214.9 million to $1.94 billion as compared to $1.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary contributor to our year over year increase is our Durango property which opened on December 5, 2023. The opening of Durango resulted in cannibalization at our other properties in line with our expectations, primarily at Red Rock. In addition, certain of our properties experienced disruption from traffic improvements and construction disruption associated with renovations and new amenities. We achieved year over year growth of 12.8%, 14.9%, 9.5% and 5.9% in casino revenue, food and beverage, room and other revenues, respectively.  
Operating Income.
  For the year ended December 31, 2024 our operating income was $568.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023 our operating income was $558.7 million. Our Durango property primarily drove the increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. Additional information about factors impacting our operating income is discussed below.
Casino.
  As described under 
Net Revenues
 above, our casino revenues increased by 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. For 2024, slot handle increased by 9.5%, table games drop increased by 41.4% and race and sports write was flat, all as compared to 2023. Our slot hold for 2024 was consistent compared to 2023, while our table games hold decreased 1.1% and our race and sports hold decreased 1.4%, both as compared to 2023. Casino expenses increased by 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the opening of our Durango property.
Food and Beverage.
  Food and beverage includes revenue and expenses from restaurants, bars and catering. For the year ended December 31, 2024, food and beverage revenue increased by 14.9% as compared to 2023, primarily due to additional food and beverage offerings. For 2024, the average guest check increased by 10.4% and the number of restaurant guests served increased by 8.6% as compared to 2023. Food and beverage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year increased by 20.6%, primarily due to the opening of our Durango property.
Room.  
For the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, room revenues increased by 9.5% and room expenses increased by 15.8%. The increase in room revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, was primarily due to the opening of our Durango property.

Our ADR improved by 2.2% and our revenue per available room improved by 2.7% for 2024 as compared to 2023. Our occupancy rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was in-line with the prior year.
Other.  
Other primarily represents revenues from tenant leases, retail outlets, bowling, spas and entertainment, and their corresponding expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2024, other revenues increased by 5.9% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by additional leased outlets. Other expenses decreased by 5.8% as compared to the prior year. 
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”).
  SG&A expenses increased by 15.4% to $432.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $374.5 million for the prior year. The increase in SG&A expenses as compared to the prior year was primarily due to expenses associated with the opening of our Durango property and higher employee-related costs as a result of wage increases. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were effectively flat as compared to the prior year as we continued to focus on operational efficiencies and cost control.

Depreciation and Amortization.
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased to $187.1 million as compared to $132.5 million for 2023. The increase for 2024 was primarily due to higher depreciation expense associated with Durango’s assets placed in service in December 2023.
Write-downs and other, net. 
 Write-downs and other, net, include gains and losses on asset disposals, demolition and other costs associated with properties that were permanently closed, development and preopening expenses, business innovation and technology enhancements, contract termination costs and non-routine items. For the year ended December 31, 2024, write-downs and other, net was an expense of $6.7 million, primarily comprising business innovation development expenses of $3.5 million, $1.3 million in development and preopening expenses (including refunds for previously expensed development costs of $5.8 million) and loss on asset disposals of $1.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, write-downs and other, net was an expense of $32.0 million, primarily comprising $53.4 million in development and preopening expenses, $10.1 million of demolition costs associated with properties that were permanently closed and $4.0 million in business innovation development expenses, partially offset by net gains on land sales of $38.6 million.

Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $228.8 million, an increase of 26.4% as compared to $181.0 million for 2023. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to capitalized interest in the prior year as well as an increase in borrowings for the current year. At December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of borrowings under the credit agreements were based on variable interest rates, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus applicable margins of 1.50% to 2.00%, and the SOFR rate applicable to our outstanding SOFR-based borrowings was 4.36% to 4.38%. We expect that interest rates on our credit facility will continue to vary in response to macroeconomic conditions. Based on our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2024, an assumed 1% increase in variable interest rates would cause our annual interest rate cost to increase by approximately $17.1 million.
On March 14, 2024, we completed a series of refinancing transactions pursuant to which we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for the New Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) and issued $500.0 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2032 (the “6.625% Senior Notes”). On December 18, 2024, Station LLC entered into the first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) to reduce the interest rate margins applicable to the New Term Loan B Facility. See 
“Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity”
 below and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the refinancing transactions as well as our other long-term debt.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 represented the portion of net income attributable to the ownership interest in Station Holdco not held by us.
Provision for Income Tax.  
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of $36.9 million and $43.0 million, respectively. Station Holdco is treated as a partnership for income tax reporting and Station Holdco’s members are liable for federal, state and local income taxes based on their share of Station Holdco’s taxable income. We are not liable for income tax on the noncontrolling interests’ share of Station Holdco’s taxable income or benefit from a taxable loss, and therefore our effective tax rate of 11.2% and 11.3% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was less than the statutory rate.

The year-over-year changes in Adjusted EBITDA were due to the factors described under 
Results of Operations 
above.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely used measure of operating performance in our industry and is a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies. We believe that in addition to net income, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing our operating performance because it provides information about the performance of our ongoing core operations. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes net income plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, write-downs and other, net (including gains and losses on asset disposals, development and preopening expense, business innovation and technology enhancements, demolition costs and non-routine items), interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment/modification of debt, change in fair value of derivative instruments and provision for income tax.
To evaluate Adjusted EBITDA and the trends it depicts, the components should be considered. Each of these components can significantly affect our results of operations and should be considered in evaluating our operating performance, and the impact of these components cannot be determined from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. It should be noted that not all gaming companies that report EBITDA or adjustments to this measure may calculate EBITDA or such adjustments in the same manner as we do, and therefore, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other gaming companies.

Holding Company Financial Information
The indentures governing the 4.50% Senior Notes, the 4.625% Senior Notes and the 6.625% Senior Notes contain certain covenants that require Station LLC to furnish to the holders of the respective series of notes certain annual and quarterly financial information relating to Station LLC and its subsidiaries. The obligation to furnish such information may be satisfied by providing consolidated financial information of the Company along with additional disclosure explaining the differences between such information and the financial information of Station LLC and its subsidiaries on a standalone basis. The following financial information about the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries exclusive of Station LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Holding Company”), is furnished to explain the differences between the financial information of the Holding Company and the financial information of Station LLC and its subsidiaries for the periods presented in this report. The primary differences between the financial information of the Holding Company and that of Station LLC relate to income taxes, the liability associated with the tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) and a note receivable from Station LLC.
At December 31, 2024, the difference between the balance sheet for Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and the balance sheet for the Holding Company is that the Holding Company had cash of $4.2 million, $56.4 million of deferred tax assets, net, and a $53.9 million note receivable from Station LLC, which are solely assets of the Holding Company, and liabilities that are solely the Holding Company’s, consisting of a $20.4 million liability under the TRA, of which $1.4 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and $5.5 million of other liabilities. The Holding Company’s $53.9 million intercompany note receivable from Station LLC is eliminated in consolidation. At December 31, 2023, the Holding Company had cash of $0.2 million, $14.4 million of income tax receivable, $43.4 million of deferred tax assets, net, $34.0 million note receivable from Station LLC, a $22.1 million liability under the TRA, of which $1.7 million was current and $3.3 million of other liabilities.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the difference between the statement of income for Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and the statement of income for the Holding Company is that the Holding Company had a net loss of $34.6 million and $42.0 million, respectively, primarily representing provision for income tax. 
Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity
The following financial condition, capital resources and liquidity discussion contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, dispositions, acquisitions, expansion projects and issuances of debt and equity, which involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein.
