Market Information and Holders

Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TBBK.” As of February 24, 2025, there were 48,067,178 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 22 record holders. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners with shares held in street name by brokers, financial institutions and other nominees. As of January 8, 2025, the most recent date for which we have beneficial ownership information, there were at least 29,784 beneficial owners of our common stock
.
Dividends
We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our inception, and do not currently plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in 2025. However, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Bank began paying dividends to us to pay interest on certain obligations and to fund ongoing common stock repurchases. Stock repurchases are discretionary and may be terminated at any time. To the extent that planned repurchases of $37.5 million per quarter in 2025 continue, they will likely continue to be funded by dividends from the Bank to us. See 
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity.”

43

Our payment of dividends is subject to restrictions discussed in Item 1,
“Business—Regulation under Banking Law.”
 Irrespective of such restrictions, it is our intent to generally retain earnings, if any, to increase our capital and fund the development and growth of our operations, and fund stock repurchases. Our Board will determine any changes in our dividend policy based upon its analysis of factors it deems relevant. We expect that these factors would include our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory capital levels and available investment opportunities. Additionally our Board will consider the merits of stock repurchases versus dividends.

Common Stock Repurchase Plan

On November 5, 2020, the Board authorized a common stock repurchase program (the “2021 Common Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2021 Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $10.0 million in each quarter of 2021 depending on the share price, securities laws and stock exchange rules which regulate such repurchases, and repurchased shares may have been reissued for various corporate purposes.

 On October 20, 2021, the Board approved a revised stock repurchase program (the “2022 Common Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2022 Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $15.0 million in each quarter of 2022 depending on the share price, securities laws and stock exchange rules which regulate such repurchases, and repurchased shares may have been reissued for various corporate purposes. 

On October 26, 2022, the Board approved a revised stock repurchase program (the “2023 Common Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2023 Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $25.0 million in each quarter of 2023 depending on the share price, securities laws and stock exchange rules which regulate such repurchases, and repurchased shares may have been reissued for various corporate purposes. 

On October 26, 2023, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2024 fiscal year (the “2024 Common Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2024 Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million in each quarter of 2024 depending on the share price, securities laws and stock exchange rules which regulate such repurchases, and repurchased shares may have been reissued for various corporate purposes. 
The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum amount under the 2024 
Common Stock
 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. 

The purchases authorized as described above, were made in each quarter of each respective year as noted above.

On October 23, 2024, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2025 fiscal year (the “2025 Common Stock Repurchase Program”), which authorizes the Company to repurchase $37.5 million in value of the Company’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2025, for a maximum amount of $150.0 million. Under the 2025 Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company intends to 
repurchase
 shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
 The 2025

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides information about the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and asset quality and provides comparisons between our results of operations for fiscal years 2024 and 2023. For discussion and comparison of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. This information is intended to 

47

facilitate your understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview 

The Bancorp’s balance sheet has a risk profile enhanced by the special nature of the collateral supporting its loan niches, and related underwriting. Those loan niches have contributed to increased earnings levels, even during periods in which markets have experienced various economic stresses. Real estate bridge lending is comprised of workforce housing which we consider to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates, in selected states. We believe that underwriting requirements provide significant protection against loss, as supported by loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios based on third-party appraisals. SBLOC and IBLOC loans are 
collateralized
 by marketable securities and the cash value of life insurance, respectively, while SBA loans are either SBA 7(a) loans that come with significant government-related guarantees, or SBA 504 loans that are made at 50-60% LTVs. Additional detail with respect to these loan portfolios is included in the related tables in “Financial Condition.”  In 2024, we began originating consumer fintech loans, which are short-term loans made with the assistance of third party marketers and servicers. We believe that the nature of certain such loans, such as credit cards secured by deposits, or other aspects of these lending programs, also enhance their risk profile. The earnings impact of our payment businesses also positively impact our risk profile.

Nature of Operations

We are a Delaware financial holding company and our primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, National Association. The vast majority of our revenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. 
In our continuing operations, we have five primary lines of specialty lending in our national specialty finance segment:


SBLOC, IBLOC, and investment advisor financing;

leasing (direct lease financing); 

SBLs, primarily SBA loans, 

non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans; and

consumer fintech lending
.

SBLOCs and IBLOCs are loans that are generated through affinity groups and are respectively collateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of insurance policies. SBLOCs are typically offered in conjunction with brokerage accounts and are offered nationally. IBLOC loans are typically viewed as an alternative to standard policy loans from insurance companies and are utilized by our existing advisor base as well as insurance agents throughout the country. Investment advisor financing are loans made to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another investment firm or internal succession. Vehicle fleet and, to a lesser extent, other equipment leases are generated in a number of Atlantic Coast and other states and are collateralized primarily by vehicles. SBA loans are generated nationally and are collateralized by commercial properties and other types of collateral. Our non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, at fair value, are primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel and retail properties. These loans were originally generated for sale through securitizations. In 2020, we decided to retain these loans on our balance sheet as interest-earning assets and resumed originating such loans in the third quarter of 2021. These new originations are identified as real estate bridge loans, consist of apartment building loans, and are held for investment in the loan portfolio. Prior originations originally intended for securitizations continue to be accounted for at fair value, and are included on the balance sheet in “Commercial loans, at fair value.”

In the second quarter of 2024, we initiated our measured entry into consumer fintech lending, by which we make consumer loans with the marketing and servicing assistance of existing and planned new fintech relationships. While the $454.4 million of such loans at December 31, 2024 did not significantly impact income during the year, such lending is expected to meaningfully impact both the balance sheet and income in the future. We expect that impact will be reflected in a lower cost of funds for related deposits and increased transaction fees.

The majority of our deposits and non-interest income are generated in our fintech segment, or Fintech Solutions Group, which consists of consumer transaction accounts accessed by Bank-issued prepaid or debit cards and payment companies that process their clients’ corporate and consumer payments, ACH accounts, the collection of card payments on behalf of merchants and other payments through our Bank. The card-accessed deposit accounts are comprised of debit and prepaid card accounts that are generated by companies that market directly to end users. Our card-accessed deposit account types are diverse and include: consumer and business debit, general purpose reloadable prepaid, pre-tax medical spending benefit, payroll, gift, government, corporate incentive, reward, 

48

business payment accounts and others. Our ACH accounts facilitate bill payments and our acquiring accounts provide clearing and settlement services for payments made to merchants which must be settled through associations such as Visa or Mastercard. Consumer transaction account banking services are provided to organizations with a pre-existing customer base tailored to support or complement the services provided by these organizations to their customers, which we refer to as “affinity or private label banking.” These services include loan and deposit accounts for investment advisory companies through our Institutional Banking department. We typically provide these services under the name and through the facilities of each organization with whom we develop a relationship.

In 2024, we began offering loans through credit sponsorship with third parties, in our fintech segment.

Recent Developments 

On December 31, 2024, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, National Association (the “Bank”), closed on the sale of an $82 million REBLs portfolio, collateralized by apartment buildings. The sale included a $32.5 million classified loan, which was current with respect to monthly payments. The Bank provided financing to a third party purchaser, which provided a 25% payment guaranty. The leverage and guaranty provided were consistent with market terms, and the Bank’s general underwriting standards for similar loans. The resulting weighted average look-through LTVs, of the related mortgaged properties are no more than 57% as-is and 55% as-stabilized, which are further supported by the 25% payment guaranty. The look-through LTVs are the weighted average of LTVs multiplied by the leverage provided by the Company, based upon appraisals performed within the past 15 months. There was no loss of principal in connection with the sale, although $1.3 million of accrued interest was reversed in connection therewith. We believe that the sale is an indication of the liquidity of the portfolio, as further evidenced by “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs, respectively, of 77% and 68% for total special mention and substandard REBL loans, based upon appraisals performed within the past 12 months.

Primarily as a result of the aforementioned $32.5 million substandard loan in that sale, total substandard loans decreased 14%, to $134.4 million at December 31, 2024, from $155.4 million at September 30, 2024.
 Substandard loans were further reduced on January 2, 2025, on which date a $12.3 million substandard loan was repaid without loss of principal, as a result of the sale of the underlying apartment building collateral in Plainfield New Jersey. In January 2025, two loans totaling $9.8 million were transferred to non-accrual and were accordingly classified as substandard. 

As noted in the third quarter earnings release, a significant portion of the REBL portfolio was reviewed during that quarter by a firm specializing in such analysis
, 
which resulted in no additional Special Mention or Substandard determinations. Additionally, the 100 basis points of Federal Reserve rate reductions may provide cash flow benefits to floating rate borrowers. Underlying property values as supported by the LTVs noted above, also continue to facilitate the recapitalization of certain loans from borrowers experiencing cash flow issues, to borrowers with greater financial capacity. At December 31, 2024, special mention real estate bridge loans amounted to $84.4 million which was unchanged from September 30, 2024.  

The majority of the Company’s real estate owned is comprised of an apartment complex, with a balance as of December 31, 2024 of $41.1 million. That property is under agreement of sale with a sales price that is expected to cover the Company’s current balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. The purchaser has increased the total of earnest money deposits to $1.6 million, from $500,000, in consideration of extending the closing date to March 21, 2025. The Company believes that the purpose for the extension is to allow time for this sale to be included in a larger transaction. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, the earnest money deposits of $1.6 million would accrue to the Company.

Key Performance Indicators

In 2024,
 we recorded net income of $217.5
 million compared to $192.3 million in 2023, with pre-tax income increasing to $292.2 million in 2024 from $256.8 million in 2023. The increases primarily 
reflected higher net interest income, excluding the impact of consumer fintech loan credit enhancement, which had a correlated amount of provision for credit losses on consumer fintech loans. The increase in net interest income reflected net loan growth and the cumulative impact of Federal Reserve rate increases in 2023 on the loan portfolio, prior to Federal Reserve rate decreases which began in September 2024. Additionally, non-interest income from our payments businesses continued to grow. 

49

We use a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to measure our overall financial performance 
and believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends
. We describe how we calculate and use a number of these KPIs and 
analyze
 their results below
.


Return 
on assets and return on equity
. 
Two KPIs commonly used within the banking industry to measure overall financial performance are return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets measures the amount of earnings compared to the level of assets utilized to generate those earnings and is derived by dividing net income by average assets. Return on equity measures the amount of earnings compared to the equity utilized to generate those earnings and is derived by dividing net income by average shareholders’ equity
.


Ratio of equity to assets
. 
Ratio of equity to assets is another KPI frequently utilized within the banking industry and is derived by dividing period-end shareholders’ equity by period-end total assets
. 


Net interest margin and credit losses
. 
Net interest margin is a KPI associated with net interest income, which is the largest component of our earnings and is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets consisting of loans and investments, less the interest on our funding, consisting primarily of deposits. Net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Higher levels of earnings and net interest income on lower levels of assets, equity and interest-earning assets are generally desirable. However, these indicators must be considered in light of regulatory capital requirements, which impact equity, and credit risk inherent in loans. Accordingly, the magnitude of credit losses is an additional KPI
. 


Other KPIs
. 
Other KPIs we use from time to time include growth in average loans and leases, non-interest income growth, the level of non-interest expense and various capital measures
.

In the past three years, we have continued to target loan niches which we believe have lower credit risk than certain other forms of lending. These include SBLOC and IBLOC; SBA loans, a significant portion of which are government guaranteed or must have loan-to-value ratios lower than other forms of lending; leasing to which we have access to underlying vehicles; and real estate bridge lending for apartment buildings in selected national regions. Significant amounts of balances of these loans are variable rate and adjust more fully to Federal Reserve rate changes than do our deposits, which are derived primarily from our payments businesses. In 2024, we significantly increased our fixed rate investment portfolio to reduce exposure to lower rate environments.  
Average loans and leases grew to $5.93 billion in 2024 from $5.73 billion in 2023.

Increases in the return on average assets (‘ROA”) and return on average common equity (“ROE”) KPIs in 2024 reflected the impact of net loan growth and higher rates on loans as a result of Federal Reserve rate increases, prior to decreases which began in September 2024. The impact of loan growth in certain categories was offset by SBLOC and IBLOC payoffs, which we believe resulted from customer resistance to such higher rates.  The net interest margin decreased to 4.85% in 2024 from 4.95% in 2023 and return on assets and return on equity respectively amounted to 2.71% and 27.24%, compared to 2.59% and 25.62%. ROA and ROE also reflected growth in ACH, card and other payment processing fees, prepaid, debit card and related fees and consumer credit 

50

fintech fees. Changes in book value per common share and the equity to assets ratio primarily reflect earnings retention, net of the impact of share repurchases and changes in the value of available-for-sale securities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
Our accounting and reporting policies conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the determination of our allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and securities requires estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
We determine our allowance for credit losses with the objective of maintaining an allowance level we believe to be sufficient to absorb our estimated current and future expected credit losses.
 We base our determination of the adequacy of the allowance on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, the amount of loss we may incur on a defaulted loan, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and historical loss experience. We also evaluate economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses and other risks in our loan portfolio. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, we may need additional provisions for credit losses. Any such additional provisions for credit losses will be a direct charge to our earnings. We utilize a CECL model to determine the adequacy of the allowance and inputs include net charge-off history and estimated loan lives. The allowance for credit losses is accordingly sensitive to changes in these inputs, such that related increases would increase the allowance and provision. See 
“
Allowance for Credit Losses”, “
Note E—Loans” and 
“Note D—Investment Securities” to the audited consolidated financial statements herein for other factors to which the allowance and provision are sensitive. 
We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses on securities result from credit, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors, and underlying collateral, as applicable. In addition, we consider the continuing performance of the securities. We recognize credit losses through the consolidated statements of operations. If management believes market value losses are not credit related, we recognize the reduction in other comprehensive income, through equity. Our evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is sensitive to the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral, and (e) the payment structure of the security. If a credit loss is determined, we estimate expected future cash flows to estimate the credit loss amount with a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources and internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security.
Results of Operations 

Overview 

Net interest income continued its upward trend in 2024, increasing $22.2 million to 
$376.2 million in 2024 from $354.1 million 
in 2023. 
The increase reflected the impact of the higher interest rate environment on loans and growth in certain loan categories, partially offset by the impact of lower balances for SBLOCs and IBLOCs, and commercial loans, at fair value which are in runoff. 
At December 31, 2024, our total loans, including commercial loans, at fair value, amounted to $6.34 billion, an increase of $642.8 million, or 11.3%, over the $5.69 billion balance at December 31, 2023
.
 Our investment securities available-for-sale increased $755.3 million to $1.50 billion from $747.5 million between those respective dates reflecting 
$900 million of fixed rate securities purchases in April, 2024. Those securities purchases were made to reduce exposure to lower rate environments. 
 The provision for credit losses on non-consumer fintech loans increased $854,000 to $9.3 million in 2024, reflecting the $2.0 million impact of
 a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans in the third quarter of 2024.

The provision also reflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs
. Please see “Results of Operations-Provision for Credit Losses on Loans” below.

A $34.4
 million increase in non-interest income in 2024 compared to 2023 reflected 
$19.6 million
 of consumer fintech loan credit enhancement income, which correlated to a like amount for provision for credit loss for consumer fintech loans. It also reflected
 an $8.0 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees and
 increased ACH, card and other payment processing fees.

51

While the dollar amount of payment transactions continued its upward trend, prepaid, debit card and related fees do not necessarily grow proportionately, as transactions have been shifting to debit cards, for which margins are generally lower. Fees earned for volumes above certain thresholds for individual relationships may also be lower. 

In 2024, total non-interest expense increased $12.2 million to $203.2 million compared to $191.0 million in 2023, reflecting 
an increase of $10.5 million in salaries expense which 
reflected increases in payments related financial crimes and IT salary expense 
and incentive compensation expense, including stock compensation expense. 

Net Income: 2024 compared to 2023 

Net income was $217.5 million in 2024 compared to $192.3 million in 2023, while income before taxes was, respectively, $292.2 million and $256.8 million, an increase of $35.4 million. In 2024, net interest income grew by $22.2 million and non-interest income increased $34.4 million. The $22.2 million, or 6.3%, increase 
in 2024 net interest income over 2023 reflected the 
impact of net loan growth and Federal Reserve rate increases
. While the Federal Reserve began decreasing rates in September 2024, approximately $900 million of fixed rate securities purchases in April 2024, had significantly reduced related downward exposure to our net interest income resulting from our variable rate loan and securities portfolios. 
 The $34.4
 million 
increase in non-interest income reflected $19.6 million of
 consumer fintech loan credit enhancement income, which correlated to a like amount for provision for credit loss for consumer fintech loans,
 and an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other payment processing fees partially offset
 by

a $1.0 million decrease in net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, primarily non-SBA commercial real estate loans, at fair value. That decrease reflected lower fees recognized at the time those loans are repaid, as a result of the run-off of that fair value portfolio. 

Reflecting the above changes, net income amounted to $217.5 million in 2024 compared to $192.3 million in 2023, or earnings per diluted share of $4.29 compared to $3.49 in 2023.

Net Interest Income: 2024 compared to 2023

Our net interest income for 2024 increased to $376.2 million, an increase of $22.2 million, or 6.3%, from $354.1 million for 2023, reflecting a $42.1 million, or 8.3%, increase in interest income to $551.6 million from $509.5 million for 2023. 
The growth in interest income reflected net loan growth and 
increases in yields as a result of Federal Reserve rate hikes, prior to reductions which began in September 2024. 

Our average loans and leases increased 3.4% to $5.93 billion in 2024 from $5.73 billion for 2023. 
The increase in loans reflected growth in, SBA, direct lease financing, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor loans, partially offset by decreases in SBLOC and IBLOC loans. The balance of our commercial loans, at fair value also decreased primarily reflecting non-SBA commercial real estate loan payoffs of loans previously held for sale, but which continue to be accounted for at fair value. In the third quarter of 2021, we resumed originating such loans, referred to as real estate bridge loans which are accounted for as held for investment. Of the total $22.2 million increase in loan interest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $13.1 million for all real estate bridge loans, $12.2 million for small business lending, $9.7 million for leasing and $5.3 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC decreased $19.9 million. 
Our average investment securities were $1.33 billion for 2024 compared to $770.0 million for 2023, while related interest income increased $27.2 million on a tax equivalent basis 
primarily reflecting an increase in yields. 

While interest income increased by $42.1 million, or 8.3%, 
interest expense increased by $19.9 million, or 12.8%, to $175.4 million in 2024 from $155.5 million in 2023
. As a result of contractual relationships with its clients, deposit rates adjust to a portion of Federal Reserve rate changes, while loans, especially variable rate loans, adjust more fully.  
Our net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for 2024 decreased 10 basis points to 4.85% from 4.95% for 2023. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased to 7.11% from 7.13% for 2023, a decrease of 2 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.46% for 2024 from 2.38% for 2023, an increase of 8 basis points
, or a net change of 10 basis points
. The yield on loans in total increased to 7.74% from 7.62%, an increase of 12 basis points, while the yield on 
taxable investment securities de
creased 12 basis points to 4.98% from 5.10%. 

52

In 2024, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $6.88 billion, compared to $6.31 billion in 2023, an increase of 9.0%, reflecting growth in debit, prepaid card account and other payments balances.
 The yield on those deposits increased to 2.35% in 2024 compared to 2.30% in 2023, reflecting the impact of Federal Reserve rate hikes on contractually based fees. Savings and money market balances averaged $72.0 million in 2024 compared to $78.1 million in 2023 with an average 3.52% rate in 2024 compared to 3.66% in 2023. Lower savings and money market balances compared to prior periods reflected the sweeping of deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits.

In 2024 compared to 2023, average interest-earning assets increased to $7.76 billion, an increase of $608.9 million, or 8.5%. The increase reflected a $196.9 million, or 3.4%, increase in average loans and leases. 
The increase in average loans reflected decreases in SBLOC and IBLOC and commercial loans, at fair value which partially offset increases in small business, direct lease financing, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor financing.
 Average balances of investment securities increased $564.7 million, or 73.3%, reflecting 
$900 million of securities purchases in April, 2024
.

Provision for Credit Losses

on Loans
Our provision for credit 
losses
 on 
non-consumer fintech loans was $9.3 million for 2024 and $8.5 million for 2023. Provisions are based on our evaluation of the adequacy of our ACL, particularly in light of the estimated impact of charge-offs and the potential impact of current economic conditions which might impact our borrowers. 
The increased provision in 2024 over 2023 reflected a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, which resulted in a $2.0 million increase in the provision in the third quarter of 2024. The provision in both years also reflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, especially in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which total exposure was approximately $32 million at December 31, 2024. For additional related information see “Note E—Loans” 
to the audited consolidated financial statements herein
.

At December 31, 2024, our ACL amounted to $31.9 million, or 0.52%, of total loans.
 We believe that our allowance is appropriate and supportable in providing for current and future expected losses, consistent with CECL guidance.
 For more information about our provision and ACL and our loss experience see 
“—Financial Condition—Allowance for Credit Losses”
 and 
“—Summary of Loan and Lease Loss Experience,”
 below
.
Provision for Credit Loss

on Trust Preferred Security
The Bank owns one trust preferred security, which it purchased in 2006, and which has a par value of $10.0 million, and owns no other such security or similar security. The security was issued by an aggregator of insurance lines in run-off, including workmen’s compensation lines. In the third quarter of 2023, the Bank was notified that interest payments were being deferred on the security, as permitted under the terms of the trust preferred indenture which permits such deferrals for up to twenty consecutive quarters. At the end of the deferral, deferred interest must be repaid, including interest on the deferred interest. The Bank placed the security in non-accrual status and continued previous efforts to obtain financial information from the issuer, which is not required to provide such information under the terms of the related indenture. Limited financial and other information finally distributed to 

54

holders in the fourth quarter of 2023, did not provide a substantial basis for repayment. Accordingly, the Bank provided for a potential loss for the full amount of the $10.0 million par value of the security through a provision of $10.0 million. The security had previously been valued at $6.3 million through adjustments to equity. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the issuer tendered an offer to repurchase these securities which the Company accepted. Accordingly, $1.0 million was recovered which resulted in a reversal of the provision for credit loss in that amount, and a charge-off of the remaining $9.0 million of the security. 
Non-Interest Income: 
2024 compared to 2023

Non-interest income was $146.5 million for 2024 compared to $112.1 million for 2023. The $34.4 million, or 30.7%, increase between those respective periods 
reflected 
$19.6 million
 of consumer fintech loan credit enhancement income which correlated to a like amount for provision for credit loss for consumer fintech loans,
 and an $8.0 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees.
 The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other payment processing fees
, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, as a result of the runoff of that fair value portfolio
. The $2.7 million net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value for 2024 was comprised of $3.7 million of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loan repayment related income, partially offset by $683,000 of fair value losses and $285,000 of hedge losses. 
The $3.7 million net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value for 2023 was comprised of $7.0 million of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loan repayment related income, partially offset by $3.1 million of fair value losses and $124,000 of hedge losses.

Consumer credit fintech fees amounted to $4.8 million for the year ended 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending in the second quarter of 2024. These fees reflect credit sponsorship fees from third parties who market and service these loans. Related impact may also be reflected in a lower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.

Prepaid and debit card and related fees increased $8.0 million, or 8.9%, to $97.4 million for 2024 from $89.4 million for 2023. 
The first quarter of 2023 included approximately $600,000 of non-interest income related to the fourth quarter of 2022, and a $1.4 million termination fee from a client which formed its own bank. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and organic growth from existing clients.
 ACH, card and other payment processing fees increased $4.8 million, or 48.6%, to $14.6 million for 2024 compared to $9.8 million for 2023
, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume
.

Leasing related income decreased $2.4 million, or 38.0%, to $3.9 million for 2024 from $6.3 million for 2023
 , reflecting $1.1 million of losses related to an auto auction company which ceased operations.

Other non-interest income increased $626,000, or 22.5%, to $3.4 million in 2024 from $2.8 million in 2023, reflecting 
increased payoff fees on advisor financing loans.

Non-Interest Expense: 2024 compared to 2023

Total non-interest expense in 2024 was $203.2 million, an increase of $12.2 million, or 6.4%, from the $191.0 million in 2023.
 S
alaries 
and
 employee benefits increased 8.7%, reflecting increases in payments business related financial crimes, IT salary expense 
and incentive compensation expense, including stock compensation expense.


FDIC insurance expense increased $622,000, or 21.0%, to $3.6 million for 2024 from $3.0 million in 2023, 
reflecting increases in liabilities against which insurance rates are applied.


Software expense increased $564,000, or 3.3%, to $17.9 million in 2024 from $17.3 million in 2023. 
The increase reflected higher expenditures for information technology infrastructure including leasing, institutional banking, cybersecurity, cloud computing and enterprise risk, which more than offset decreased expenses related to financial crimes management
. 

Insurance expense increased $56,000, or 1.1%, to $5.2 million in 2024 from $5.1 million in 2023. 

Telecom and IT network communications expense decreased $89,000, or 6.8%, to $1.2 million in 2024 from $1.3 million in 2023. 

Consulting expense decreased $86,000, or 4.4%, to $1.9 million in 2024 from $1.9 million in 2023.

Other non-interest expense increased $444,000, or 2.2%, to $20.4 million in 2024 from $20.0 million in 2023. 
The $444,000 increase primarily reflected 
a $1.2 million loss from a transaction processing delay and a $989,000 increase in OREO expense offset by the following decreases:  (i) other loan expense of $443,000 (ii) correspondent banking fees of $381,000 (iii) regulatory examination fees of $259,000 and (iv) other operating taxes of $353,000. The $989,000 increase in OREO expense, reflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024, as described in 
“
Note E—Loans”. 
The balance of that property, which is under agreement of sale as described in “Recent Developments”, was $41.1 million as of December 31, 2024.

56

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $74.6 million and $64.5 million respectively, for 2024 and 2023.
 The increase resulted primarily from an increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax.
 The effective tax rate was 25.5% in 2024 compared to 25.1% in 2023 and reflects a 21% federal tax rate and state taxes.
 The lower rate in 2023 reflected the impact of adjustments related to state taxes in multiple states, including 
those related to the relocation of the Bank’s corporate headquarters to South Dakota.
Liquidity 
Liquidity defines our ability to generate funds at a reasonable cost to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely affecting daily operations or financial condition. Our liquidity management policy requirements include sustaining defined liquidity minimums, concentration monitoring and management, stress testing, contingency planning and related oversight. 
Based on our sources of funding and liquidity discussed below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for our needs in the next 12 months and for the longer-term beyond 12 months. The adequacy of liquidity is supported by (a) the historical stability and growth of its relationships which are further subject to multi-year contracts, (b) access to contingent funding and (c) the short terms and liquidity of significant amounts of our assets. 
We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in our interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. Interest-bearing balances at the FRB, maintained on an overnight basis, averaged $527.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the prior year fourth quarter average of $677.5 million.  
Our primary source of funding has been deposits, 
comprised primarily of millions of small transaction-based consumer balances, the majority of which are FDIC-insured
. 
We have multi-year, contractual relationships with affinity groups which sponsor such accounts and with whom we have had long-term relationships (see Item 1, “
Business—Our Strategies
”). Those long-term relationships comprise the majority of our deposits and in addition to related organic growth, we continue to add new affinity groups. We do not believe that the changes in our deposits in the past two years significantly impacted overall liquidity or cost of funds as a result of such long-term relationships and a history of stability, further managed through multi-year contracts. 
Average deposits in 2024 increased by $540.0 million, or 8.4%, to $6.95 billion compared to 
$6.41 billion in 2023
. 
Average savings and money market account balances decreased $6.1 million between those periods, 
reflecting the sweeping of deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. 
Overnight borrowings are also periodically utilized as a funding source to facilitate cash management. 
One contingent source of liquidity is available-for-sale securities which amounted to $1.50 billion at December 31, 2024,
 reflecting $900 million of securities purchases in April, 2024, 
compared to $747.5 million at December 31, 2023
. In excess of $1.0 billion of these securities, including those $900 million of April 2024 purchases, can be pledged to facilitate extensions of credit in addition to loans already pledged against lines of credit, as discussed later in this section.
 At December 31, 2024 outstanding loans amounted to $6.11 billion, compared to $5.36 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $752.5 million 
representing a use of funds
. Commercial loans, at fair value decreased to $223.1 million from $332.8 million, or $109.7 million, representing a source of funds
.

While we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market accounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are obtained with the assistance of third-parties and as a result have historically been classified as brokered by the FDIC. Prior to December 2020, FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts as brokered was relatively broad, and generally included accounts which were referred to or “placed” with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases to be categorized as “well capitalized” under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over any of its deposits classified as brokered without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC’s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could effectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a new regulation which, in the third quarter of 2021, resulted in the majority of our deposits being reclassified from brokered to non-brokered. On July 30, 2024, the FDIC proposed a regulation eliminating certain automatic exceptions which resulted in the reclassification of significant amounts of our deposits from brokered to non-brokered as a result of the December 2020 rules changes, while retaining the ability of financial institutions to reapply. If the proposed regulation were to be adopted, significant amounts of our deposits could be reclassified as brokered, which could also result in an increase in our federal deposit insurance rate and expense. On January 21, 2025, the FDIC announced that the proposed regulation would not be adopted. 
Of our total deposits of $7.75 billion as of December 31, 2024, $810.6 million were classified as brokered
 and an estimated $501.1 million were not insured by FDIC insurance, which requires identification of the depositor and is limited to $250,000 per 

57

identified depositor. Uninsured accounts may represent a greater liquidity risk than FDIC-insured accounts should large depositors withdraw funds as a result of negative financial developments either at the Bank or in the economy. Significant amounts of our uninsured deposits are comprised of small balances, such as anonymous gift cards and corporate incentive cards for which there is no identified depositor. We do not believe that such uninsured accounts present a significant liquidity risk.
Certain components of our deposits experience seasonality, creating excess liquidity at certain times. The largest deposit inflows have generally occurred in the first quarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury. 
While consumer deposit accounts, including prepaid and debit card accounts, comprise the majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve which are collateralized by certain of our loans. The amount of loans pledged against these lines varies and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent remaining collateral value exceeds advances. Our collateralized line of credit with the 
Federal Reserve Bank had available accessible capacity of 
$1.99 billion as of December 31, 2024 and was collateralized by loans. We have also pledged in excess of $2.22 billion of multifamily loans to the FHLB. As a result, we have approximately $1.02 billion of availability on that line of credit which we can also access at any time. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had no amount outstanding on the Federal Reserve line or on our FHLB line.
 We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve, which, with the approximate $1.0 billion of U.S. government agency securities, represent our most readily accessible liquidity sources. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources daily. Included in our cash and cash-equivalents at December 31, 2024, were $564.1 million of interest-earning deposits, which primarily consisted of deposits with the Federal Reserve. These amounts may vary on a daily basis. 
In 2024, $242.7 million of securities redemptions were exceeded by purchases of $991.2 million. 
In 2023, $71.1 million of securities 
redemptions
 exceeded purchases of $49.0 million. In 2022, $161.1 million of 
redemptions
 exceeded purchases of $24.2 million. 
As shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash required to fund loans was $877.4 million in 2024 and $1.68 billion in 2022. 
In 2023, loan repayments exceeded disbursements.

 At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including unused lines of credit, of $1.98 billion, the vast majority of which are SBLOC lines of credit which are variable rate. We attempt to increase such line usage; however, usage percentages have been historically consistent and the majority of these lines of credit have historically not been drawn. 
The recorded amount of such

commitments has, for many accounts, been based on the full amount of collateral in a customer’s investment account. Accordingly, the funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and are expected to be funded by deposit growth. Additionally, these loans are “demand” loans and as such, represent a contingency source of funding. 

As a holding company conducting substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries, our near term needs for liquidity consist principally of cash needed to make required interest payments on our 
subordinated debentures, consisting of $13.4 million of debentures bearing interest at 
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)
 plus 3.51% and maturing in March 2038 (the “2038 Debentures”), and senior debt, consisting of $100.0 million senior notes with an interest rate of 4.75% and maturing in August 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”)
. 
Semi-annual interest payments on the 2025 Senior Notes are approximately $2.4 million, and quarterly interest payments on the 2038 Debentures are approximately $300,000. We may repay the notes with a dividend from the bank, or refinance the debt with a new debt offering.
 As of December 31, 2024, we had cash reserves of approximately $10.7 million at the holding company. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Bank began paying dividends to the holding company to pay interest on these obligations and to fund ongoing common stock repurchases. Stock repurchases are discretionary and may be terminated at any time. To the extent that planned repurchases of $37.5 million per quarter in 2025 continue, they will likely continue to be funded by dividends from the Bank to the holding company. 
The holding company’s sources of liquidity are primarily comprised of dividends paid to it by the Bank and the issuance of debt.

Capital Resources and Requirements

We must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by our regulators. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets of 6.50% to be considered “well capitalized.” The Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the most recent quarter. Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders’ equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles. At December 31, 2024, both the Company and the Bank were “well capitalized” under banking regulations.

Asset and Liability Management 

The management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate sensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution’s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates. While it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation and responsive Federal Reserve rate changes on our net interest income, the Federal Reserve has historically utilized interest rate increases in the overnight federal funds rate as one tool in fighting inflation. As a result of high rates of inflation, the Federal Reserve raised rates in each quarter of 2022 and in the first three quarters of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024 the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. Our largest funding source, prepaid and debit card accounts, contractually adjusts to only a portion of increases or decreases in rates which are largely determined by such Federal Reserve actions. While deposits reprice to only a portion of rate increases, interest-earning assets tend to adjust more fully to rate increases at contractual pricing intervals which may be monthly or up to several years. While significant amounts of our loans and securities are variable rate and reprice monthly, quarterly or over several years, we increased fixed rate loans and securities in 2024, to reduce exposure to lower interest rate environments. Additionally, the impact of loan interest rate floors which must be exceeded before rates on certain loans increase, may result in decreases in net interest income with lesser increases in rates. At December 31, 2024, all of the floors had been exceeded. 

As a financial institution, potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of our market risk. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of our earnings and the market value of our interest-earning assets, other than those with short-term maturities. We do not own any trading assets nor do we engage in hedging transactions. 

We have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer the policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and others. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results and develop strategies to achieve budgetary targets based upon current and anticipated market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate risk, consistent with policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.

We monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known as “gap analysis”) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then estimate the effect of various changes in interest rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or “interest rate sensitivity gap”) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate will reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.

Both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Interest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds 

59

the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, all else equal. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely.

The following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2024. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability. The majority of demand and interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be “core” deposits, or deposits that will generally remain with us regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience, judgmental predictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates for competitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest-bearing demand accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances will reprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest expense. We have adjusted the transaction account balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates. Loans and security balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The largest segments of loans subject to interest rate floors are the majority of non-SBA commercial real estate loans-floating, at fair value, REBL, and IBLOC loans. While floors may provide some protection against future Federal Reserve rate reductions, that protection is limited since current rates generally significantly exceed such floors. The table does not assume any prepayment of fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related behavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities (for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits) is beyond our control. As a result, certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels. For instance, the majority of REBL loans are variable rate with floors, but prepayments may offset the benefit of such floors in decreasing rate environments.

Transaction accounts are comprised primarily of demand deposits. While demand deposits are non-interest-bearing, related fees paid to affinity groups may reprice according to specified indices.

The methods used to analyze interest rate sensitivity in this table have a number of limitations. Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the actual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table. 

60

Because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above, we believe that interest sensitivity modeling may more accurately reflect the effects of our exposure to changes in interest rates, notwithstanding its own limitations. Net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the consolidated balance sheet including the effects of the aforementioned interest rate floors, interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits. As such, net interest income simulation is designed to address the potential impact of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the consolidated balance sheet to those changes. Market Value of Portfolio Equity (“MVPE”) represents the modeled fair value of the net present portfolio value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items and is reflected in the Net portfolio value column in the table below.

We believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income, could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table shows the effects of interest rate shocks on our net portfolio value described as MVPE and net interest income. Rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our policy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy guidelines at December 31, 2024. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in 2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period levels, as the majority of loans and securities were variable rate in those periods. In April 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of fixed rate commercial and residential mortgage securities of varying maturities to reduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income, in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate reductions which commenced in September 2024. Those securities purchases had respective estimated weighted average yields and lives of approximately 5.11% and eight years
. Those 2024 securities purchases and an emphasis on adding fixed rate loans, significantly reduced exposure to lower rate environments.

If we should experience a mismatch in our desired gap ranges, or an excessive decline in our MVPE subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate, we have a number of options available to remedy such a mismatch. We could restructure our investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes. We could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes, or we could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities.

We continue to evaluate market conditions and may change our current interest rate strategy in response to changes in those conditions. For instance we may increase securities purchases to lock in higher rates for the terms of such securities. Such purchases would decrease our asset sensitivity, and could reduce the decrease in net interest income which would otherwise result from Federal Reserve rate decreases.
 To the extent that longer term securities purchases are funded with short-term deposits, 
the rate on such deposits may be higher than the rates on the securities purchased, if the yield curve is inverted. In that case, net interest income may also be decreased, at least in the short-term, prior to anticipated Federal Reserve rate reductions. 
Financial Condition 
Genera
l

Our total assets at December 31, 2024 were $8.73 billion, of which our total loans and commercial loans, at fair value were $6.34 billion and investment securities available-for-sale were $1.50 billion. At December 31, 2023, our total assets were $7.71 billion, of which our total loans and commercial loans, at fair value were $5.69 billion and investment securities available-for-sale were $747.5 million. 
The increase in assets reflected an increase in available-for-sale securities, which resulted from the previously discussed $900 million of April 2024 securities purchases. The increase also reflected loan growth in various loan categories, which offset decreases in IBLOC loan balances and in commercial loans, at fair value as that portfolio continues to run off
.

Interest-earning Deposits 
At 
December 31, 2024
, we had a total of $564.1 million of interest-earning deposits, comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve, which pays interest on such balances. At December 31, 2023, we had $1.03 billion of such balances. 
The decrease reflected the utilization of these overnight balances for the aforementioned securities purchases in the second quarter of 2024.
Investment Portfolio

For detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see “Note D—Investment Securities” to the audited consolidated financial statements herein. Total investment securities available-for-sale increased to $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $755.3 million, or 101.0%, from a year earlier. The increase reflected 
the aforementioned $900 million of securities purchases in April 2024.
Under the accounting guidance related to 
CECL
, changes in fair value of securities unrelated to credit losses continue to be recognized through equity. However, credit-related losses are recognized through an allowance, rather than through a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. CECL accounting guidance also permits the reversal of credit losses in future periods based on improvements in credit, which was not included in previous guidance. Generally, a security’s credit-related loss is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security’s effective yield. That difference is recognized through the income statement, as with prior guidance, but is renamed a provision for credit loss. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, we recognized no credit-related losses on our portfolio. In 2023, we recognized a provision for credit loss on a trust preferred security. See “Provision for Credit Loss on Trust Preferred Security”.
The following table presents the book value and the approximate fair value for each major category of our investment securities portfolio. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investments were all categorized as available-for-sale (dollars in thousands).

Investments in FHLB, Atlantic Central Bankers Bank (“ACBB”), 
and FRB stock
 are recorded at cost and amounted to $15.6 million at December 31, 2024 and $15.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
Each of these institutions requires their member banking institutions to hold stock as a condition of membership. The Bank’s conversion to a national charter required the purchase of $11.0 million of FRB stock in September 2022. 
While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions, the FHLB stock requirement increases or decreases with the level of borrowing activity.  

We pledge loans against our line of credit at the FHLB and had no securities pledged against that line as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no investment securities were encumbered through pledging or otherwise. 

62

Of the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial mortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was  reduced from $12.6 million to $3.5 million as a result of the sale of one of the two remaining collateral properties
. The $3.5 million remains in non-accrual status. While the appraised value of the remaining property allocable to the Bank’s security exceeds the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the amounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of these properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition costs. 

The following tables show the contractual maturity distribution and the weighted average yields of our investment securities portfolio as of 
December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands). The weighted average yield was calculated by dividing the amount of individual securities to total securities in each category, multiplying by the yield of the individual security, and adding the results of those individual computations.

If adjusted to their taxable equivalents, yields would approximate 4.05%, 2.91%, 4.90%, and 5.70% for zero to one year, one to five years, five to ten years, and over ten years, respectively, at a federal tax rate of 21%.

Commercial Loans, at Fair Value

Commercial loans, at fair value are comprised of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or securitization through the first quarter of 2020. These loans are now being held on the balance sheet and continue to be accounted for at fair value. Non-SBA commercial real estate loans and SBA loans are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based upon pricing for similar loans where market indications of the sales price of such loans are not available. 
SBA loans are valued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge loans are valued individually. 
Commercial loans, at fair value decreased to
 $223.1 million at December 31, 2024 from $332.8 million at December 31, 2023
, primarily reflecting the impact of loan repayments as this portfolio runs off
. 
In the third quarter of 2021 we resumed originating non-SBA commercial real estate loans, after having suspended such originations for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021. These originations reflect lending criteria similar to the prior loan portfolio and are primarily comprised of multifamily (apartment buildings) collateral. The new originations, which are intended to be held for investment, are accounted for at amortized cost. See the table below prefaced by the introduction: “Commercial real estate loans, primarily real estate bridge loans, excluding SBA loans . . . .” 

Loan Portfolio 

We have developed a detailed credit policy for our lending activities and utilize loan committees to oversee the lending function. SBLOC, IBLOC and other consumer loans, investment advisor financing, 
SBLs,
 leases and real estate bridge lending each have their own loan committee. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Credit Officer serve on all loan committees. Each committee also includes lenders from that particular type of specialty lending. The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for both regulatory compliance and adherence to our internal credit policy. Key committee members have lengthy experience and certain of them have had similar positions at substantially larger institutions. 

63

We originate substantially all of our portfolio loans, although from time to time we have purchased lease pools and may purchase other individual loans. If a proposed loan should exceed our lending limit, we would sell a participation in the loan to another financial institution.

Includes the unguaranteed portion of 7(a) Program loans which are generally70% or more guaranteed by the U.S. government. SBA 7(a) Program loans are not made on the basis of real estate LTV; however, they are subject to SBA's "All Available Collateral" rule which mandates that to the extent a borrower or its 20% or greater principals have available collateral (including personal residences), the collateral must be pledged to fully collateralize the loan, after applying SBA-determined liquidation rates. In addition, all 7(a) Program loans and 504 Program loans require the personal guaranty of all 20% or greater owners.

For SBLOC, we generally lend up to 50% of the value of equities and 80% for investment grade securities. While equities have fallen in excess of 30% in recent periods, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOCs generally has been less. This is because many collateral accounts are “balanced” and accordingly, have a component of debt securities, which did not necessarily decrease in value as much as equities, or in some cases may have increased in value. Further, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against market downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage of principal to the market value of collateral.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

A description of loan review coverage targets is set forth below. 

The following loan review percentages are performed over periods of eighteen to twenty-four months. At December 31, 2024, in excess of 50% of the total loan portfolio was reviewed by the loan review department or, for SBLs, rated internally by that department. In addition to the review of all loans classified as either special mention or substandard, the targeted coverages and scope of the reviews are risk-based and vary according to each portfolio as follows:

SBLOC
 – The targeted review threshold was 40% comprised of a sample of large balance SBLOCs by commitment. At December 31, 2024, approximately 50% of the SBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.

IBLOC
 – The targeted review threshold was 40% comprised of a sample of large balance IBLOCs by commitment. At December 31, 2024, approximately 62% of the IBLOC portfolio had been reviewed. 

69

Advisor Financing
 – The targeted review threshold was 50%. At December 31, 2024, approximately 83% of the investment advisor financing portfolio had been reviewed. The loan balance review threshold was $1.0 million.

SBLs
 – The targeted review threshold was 60%, to be rated and/or reviewed within 90 days of funding, excluding fully guaranteed loans purchased for CRA purposes, and fully guaranteed PPP loans. The loan balance review threshold was $1.5 million. At December 31, 2024, 69% of the non-government guaranteed SBL loan portfolio had been reviewed.

Direct Lease Financing
 – The targeted review threshold was 35%. At December 31, 2024, approximately 59% of the leasing portfolio had been reviewed. All lease relationships exceeding $1.5 million are reviewed.

Commercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at fair value and Commercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at amortized cost
 (
floating rate, excluding SBA, which are included in SBLs above
)
 – The targeted review threshold was 100%. Floating rate loans are reviewed initially within 90 days of funding and monitored on an ongoing basis as to payment status. Subsequent reviews are performed for all relationships maintaining a 100% coverage rate. At December 31, 2024, approximately 100% of the floating rate, non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans outstanding for more than 90 days had been reviewed. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans, at fair value
 (
fixed rate, excluding SBA, which are included in SBLs above
)
 – The targeted review threshold was 100%. At December 31, 2024, approximately 98% of the 
fixed rate, non-SBA commercial real estate loan portfolio had been reviewed
. 

Other minor loan categories are reviewed at the discretion of the loan review department. 

In 2022 loans previously in discontinued operations were reclassified to held for investment. As a result of the loan reclassification, related valuation reserves were reversed as a credit to “Net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value” in the consolidated statement of operations, while the allowances for credit losses and loan commitments in the consolidated balance sheet were increased through a provision for credit losses. Accordingly, a $3.5 million credit to “ Net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value” was offset by a provision for credit losses of $3.5 million with no net impact on income. Of the $3.5 million provision, $1.3 million increased the ACL and $2.2 million increased the allowance for loan commitments recorded in other liabilities. 

At December 31, 2024, the ACL amounted to $31.9 million, which represented a $4.6 million increase compared to the $27.4 million at December 31, 2023.
 The increase reflected the impact of a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, as the provision for credit losses was accordingly increased by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase also reflected the impact of higher leasing net charge-offs.

 The $12.3 million shown in the non-accrual column for real estate bridge loans was repaid on January 2, 2025 without loss of principal. 
The table above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would no longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%. Since 2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously. In January 2025, two loans totaling $9.8 million were transferred to non-accrual and were accordingly classified as substandard. 

Although we consider our ACL to be appropriate and supportable based on information currently available, future additions to the ACL may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions, our ongoing loss experience and that of our peers, changes in management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses, deterioration of specific credits and management’s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases. 

Management 
estimates the ACL quarterly, and except for SBLOC, IBLOC and other loans uses relevant internal and external historical loan performance information, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the initial basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The methodology used in the estimation of the ACL, which is performed at least quarterly, is also designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan performance. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of the 
Board
 for their review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of loss/loss given default, and the other loan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the ACLs for other categories are determined by establishing reserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of the collateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated fair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.

Except 
for SBLOC, IBLOC and other loans as noted above, for purposes of determining the pool-basis reserve, the loans not assigned an individual reserve are segregated by product type, to recognize differing risk characteristics within portfolio segments, and an average historical loss rate is calculated for each product type. Loss rates are computed by classifying net charge-offs by year of loan origination, and dividing into total originations for that specific year. This methodology is referred to as vintage analysis. The average loss rate is then projected over the estimated remaining loan lives unique to each loan pool, to determine estimated lifetime 

71

losses. For SBLOC and IBLOC, since significant losses have not been incurred, probability of loss/loss given default considerations are utilized. For the other loan category discounted cash flow is utilized to determine a reserve. For all loan pools the Company considers the need for an additional ACL based upon qualitative factors such as the Company’s current loan performance statistics by pool, and economic conditions. These qualitative factors are intended to account for forward looking expectations over a twelve to eighteen month period not reflected in historical loss rates and otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. Accordingly, such factors may increase or decrease the allowance compared to historical loss rates as the Company’s forward looking expectations change. The qualitative factor percentages are applied against the pool balances as of the end of the period. Aside from the qualitative adjustments to account for forward looking expectations of loss over a twelve to eighteen month projection period, the balance of the ACL reverts directly to the Company’s quantitative analysis derived from its historical loss rates. The qualitative and historical loss rate component, together with the reserves on specific loans, comprise the total ACL
. 

A 
similar process is employed to calculate an ACL assigned to off-balance sheet commitments, which are comprised of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. That ACL for unfunded commitments is recorded in other liabilities. Even though portions of the ACL may be allocated to loans that have been individually measured for credit deterioration, the entire ACL is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.

At December 31, 2024, the ACL for off-balance sheet commitments amounted to $2.0 million and the ACL for loans amounted to $31.9 million. Of the $31.9 million, $11.6 million of allowances resulted from the Company’s historical charge-off ratios, $4.4 million from reserves on specific loans, with the balance comprised of the qualitative component. The $11.6 million resulted primarily from SBA non-real estate and leasing charge-offs. The proportion of qualitative reserves compared to charge-off history related reserves reflects the general absence of charge-offs in the Company’s largest loan portfolios consisting of SBLOC and IBLOC and real estate bridge lending which results, at least in part, from the nature of related collateral. Such collateral respectively consists of marketable securities, the cash value of life insurance and workforce apartment buildings. As charge-offs are nonetheless possible, significant subjectivity is required to consider qualitative factors to derive the related component of the allowance.

The Company ranks its qualitative factors in five levels: minimal, low, moderate, moderate-high, and high-risk. The individual qualitative factors for each portfolio segment have their own scale based on an analysis of that segment. A high-risk ranking results in the largest increase in the ACL calculation with each level below having a lesser impact on a sliding scale. The qualitative factors used for each portfolio are described below in the description of each portfolio segment. 
As a result of continuing economic uncertainty in 2022, including heightened inflation and increased risks of recession, the qualitative factors which had previously been set in anticipation of a downturn, were maintained through the third quarter of 2022. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, as risks of a recession increased, the economic qualitative risk factor was increased for non-real estate SBL and leasing. Those higher qualitative allocations were retained in the first quarter of 2023, as negative economic indications persisted. In the second quarter of 2023, CECL model adjustments of $1.7 million resulted from a $2.5 million CECL model decrease from changes in estimated average lives, partially offset by a $794,000 CECL model increase resulting from increasing economic and collateral risk factors to respective moderate-high and moderate risk levels. The elevated economic risk level for leasing reflected input from department heads regarding the potential borrower impact of the higher rate environment. The elevated collateral risk level for leasing reflected lower auction prices for vehicles and uncertainty over the extent to which such prices might decrease in the future. The adjustment for average lives reflected a change in the estimated lives of leases, higher variances for which may result from their short maturities. In the third quarter of 2023, there were indications of auction price stabilization, while the auto workers’ strike could reduce supply and drive up prices. Nonetheless, the elevated risk levels were maintained. In the second quarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses was reduced by $1.4 million to reflect reduced average lives for small business non-real estate loans. 

The Company has not increased the qualitative risk levels for SBLOC or IBLOC because of the nature of related collateral. SBLOC loans are subject to maximum loan to marketable securities value, and notwithstanding historic drops in the stock market in recent years, losses have not been realized. IBLOC loans are limited to borrowers with insurance companies that exceed credit requirements, and loan amounts are limited to life insurance cash values. 
The Company had not, prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, increased the economic factor for multifamily real estate bridge lending. While Federal Reserve rate increases directly increase real estate bridge loan floating-rate borrowing costs, those borrowers are required to purchase interest rate caps that will partially limit the increase in borrowing costs during the term of the loan. Additionally, there continues to be several additional mitigating factors within the multifamily sector that should continue to fuel demand. Higher interest rates are increasing the cost to purchase a home, which in turn is increasing the number of renters and subsequent demand for multifamily. The softening demand for new homes should continue to exacerbate the current housing shortage, and therefore continue to fuel demand for multifamily apartment homes. Additionally, higher rents in the multifamily sector are causing renters to be more price sensitive, which is driving demand for most of the apartment buildings within the Company’s loan portfolio which management considers “workforce” housing.
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, an increasing trend in substandard loans was reflected in an increase in the risk level for the REBL ACL economic 

72

qualitative factor, which resulted in a $1.0 million increase in the fourth quarter provision for credit loss on loans.

As a result of increasing amounts of loans classified as special mention and substandard, the Company evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter of 2024. Such evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates

that may be susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company added a new qualitative factor to its ACL which increased the provision for credit losses by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. 

The economic qualitative factor is based on the estimated impact of economic conditions on the loan pools, as distinguished from the economic factors themselves, for the following reasons. The Company has experienced limited multifamily (apartment building) loan charge-offs, despite stressed economic conditions. Accordingly, the ACL for this pool was derived from a qualitative factor based on industry loss information for multifamily housing. The Company’s charge-offs have been miniscule for SBLOC and IBLOC notwithstanding stressed economic periods, and their ACL is accordingly also determined by a qualitative factor. Investment advisor loans were first offered in 2020 with limited performance history, during which charge-offs have not been experienced. For investment advisor loans, the nature of the underlying ultimate repayment source was considered, namely the fee-based advisory income streams resulting from investment portfolios under management, and the impact changes in economic conditions would have on those payment streams. The qualitative factors used for this and the other portfolios are described below in the description of each portfolio segment. Additionally, the Company’s charge-off histories for SBLs, primarily SBA, and leases have not correlated with economic conditions, including trends in unemployment. While specific economic factors did not correlate with actual historical losses, multiple economic factors are considered in the economic qualitative factor. For the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans, leases, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor financing, the Company’s loss forecasting analysis included a review of industry statistics. However, the Company’s own charge-off history and average life estimates, for categories in which the Company has experienced charge-offs, was the primary quantitatively derived element in the forecasts. The qualitative component results from management’s qualitative assessments which consider internal and external inputs.

The ratio of the ACL to total loans increased to 0.52% at December 31, 2024 compared to 0.51% at December 31, 2023
. The $4.6 million increase in the ACL between those dates, reflected approximately $1.5 million of increased reserves on specific distressed credits. Approximately $1.0 million had been added to the ACL in fourth quarter 2023 for the economic qualitative factor for an increasing trend in REBL special mention and substandard real estate bridge loans. As a result of further such increases, in the third quarter of 2024, $2.0 million was added for a new related qualitative factor. Additionally, increases in leasing reserves more than offset reductions in SBA non-real estate reserves, reflecting continued elevated leasing charge-offs.  
The ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans decreased to 94.61% at December 31, 2024 from 206.33% over the prior year end, 
primarily as a result of the increase in non-performing loans which proportionately exceeded the increase in the ACL
.

As a result of the increase in non-performing loans, which included a $12.3 million REBL loan and increased SBL commercial mortgage and leasing balances, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans also increased to 0.55% at December 31, 2024 from 0.25% at December 31, 2023.  
Nonperforming loans are comprised of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest. 
T
he ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to
 1.10% at December 31, 2024 from 0.39% at the prior year end, 
reflecting the increase in non-performing loans, and a $39.4 million loan transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024 with a December 31, 2024 balance of $41.1 million.

That property is under agreement of sale with a sales price that is expected to cover the Company’s current balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. The purchaser has increased the total of earnest money deposits to $1.6 million, from $500,000, in consideration of extending the closing date to March 21, 2025. The Company believes that the purpose for the extension is to allow time for this sale to be included in a larger transaction. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, the earnest money deposits of $1.6 million would accrue to the Company.

The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.43% at December 31, 2024 compared to 0.07% 
at the prior year end. 
In 2024, lending agreements related to consumer fintech loans had certain charge-offs accounted for as freestanding credit enhancements which resulted in the Company recording a $19.6 million provision for credit losses and a correlated amount in non-interest income resulting in no impact to net income. Additionally, the increase reflected an increase in direct lease financing net charge-offs.

Net Charge-offs

Net charge-offs were $24.4 million in 2024, an 
increase of $20.9 from net charge-offs of
 $3.5 million in 2023. 
In 2024, lending agreements related to consumer fintech loans had certain charge-offs accounted for as freestanding credit enhancements which resulted in the Company recording a $19.6 million provision for credit losses and a correlated amount in non-interest income resulting in no impact to net income.
 Additionally, c
harge-offs in both periods resulted from leasing and non-real estate SBL charge-offs. SBL charge-offs resulted primarily from the non-government guaranteed portion of SBA loans
.

We review charge-offs at least quarterly in loan surveillance meetings which include the Chief Credit Officer, the loan review department and other senior credit officers in a process which includes identifying any trends or other factors impacting portfolio management. In recent periods charge-offs have been primarily comprised of the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) Program loans 
and leases. The charge-offs have resulted from individual borrower or business circumstances as opposed to overall trends or other factors.

Non-accrual Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans 

Loans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing 
interest
. A loan which is past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the process of collection
. W
e had $62.0 million of OREO at December 31, 2024 and $16.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
The following tables summarize our non-performing loans, including loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest and OREO

The $12.3 million REBL shown for 2024 was repaid on January 2, 2025 without loss of principa
l. 
In January 2025, two loans totaling $9.8 million were transferred to non-accrual and were accordingly classified as substandard. 

(2) 
The majority of the increase in Loans past due 90 days or more in 2024 compared to the prior year resulted from a $3.3 million IBLOC loan secured by the cash value of insurance, the payoff of which was subject to an administrative delay by the related insurance company. 
(3)  
In the first quarter of 2024, a $39.4 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status to OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at December 31, 2024, with a balance at that date of $41.1 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. That property is under agreement of sale with a sales price that is expected to cover the Company’s current balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. The purchaser has increased the total of earnest money deposits to $1.6 million, from $500,000, in consideration of extending the closing date to March 21, 2025. The Company believes that the purpose for the extension is to allow time for this sale to be included in a larger transaction. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, the earnest money deposits of $1.6 million would accrue to the Company.  The nonaccrual balances in this table as of December 31, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was less than 73%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately 63% based upon recent appraisals. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete. The balances for both periods were also classified as either special mention or substandard as of December 31, 2024. The $12.3 million REBL shown for 2023 was repaid on January 2, 2025 without loss of principal. 

Of the

$84.4 million special mention and $134.4 million substandard REBL loans at December 31, 2024, $13.2 million was modified in the fourth quarter of 2024 and received a reduction in interest rate and a combination of full and partial payment deferrals. Not included in that fourth quarter modification total were $27.6 million of balances which we recapitalized with a new borrower, who negotiated payment deferrals and rate reductions. The “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs for the $13.2 million balance were 80% and 69%, respectively, while weighted average LTVs for the $27.6 million were 79% and 70%, respectively. These LTVs are based upon appraisals performed within the past twelve months. The above information for the first three quarters of 2024 is available in the applicable Form 10-Q.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, there were $75.7 million of loans classified as modified with specific reserves of $768,000, while there were $13.1 million of loans classified as modified for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 with specific reserves of $127,000.

Percentage represents the principal of loans deferred divided by the principal of the total loan portfolio.

With the exception of $927,000 of future funding for a REBL loan, we had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified as of either December 31, 2024 or 2023
.

We had $27.9 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2024, compared to $11.5 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2023. The $16.4 million increase 
in non-accrual loans was primarily due to $70.4 million of additions partially offset by $44.1 million transferred to OREO, $4.4 million of charge-offs, $1.9 million transferred to repossessed vehicle inventory, $3.7 million of payments and $129,000 returned to accrual status
.

Loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest amounted to $5.8 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The $4.1 million increase reflected 
$16.1 million of additions partially offset by $12.0 million of loan payments and $24,000 transferred to non-accrual loans
. 

We had $62.0 million of OREO at December 31, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023. 
The change in balance reflected $45.0 million transferred from non-accrual loans
. 
The balance at both dates included $15.0 million for a Florida mall property. The property was reappraised in November 2024 and the appraised value continues to exceed the $15.0 million carrying value
. In the first quarter of 2024, a $39.4 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status to OREO. 
The majority of the Company’s real estate owned is comprised of that apartment complex, with a balance as of December 31, 2024 of $41.1 million. That property is under agreement of sale with a sales price that is expected to cover the Company’s current balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. The purchaser has increased the total of earnest money deposits to $1.6 million, from $500,000, in consideration of extending the closing date to March 21, 2025. The Company believes that the purpose for the extension is to allow time for this sale to be included in a larger transaction. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, the earnest money deposits of $1.6 million would accrue to the Company.

Premises and Equipment, Net

Premises
 and equipment increased
 to $27.6 million at December 31, 2024 from $27.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of expenditures for a new data center and the relocation of Sioux Falls office space, net of depreciation on prior balances. 

Other assets 

Other assets increased to $182.7 million at December 31, 2024 from $133.1 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in receivables in the ordinary course of business.

Deposits

Our primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. 
We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including demand, checking and money market accounts, through and with the assistance of affinity groups
. 
The majority of our deposits are generated through prepaid card and debit and other payments related deposit accounts
. At December 31, 2024, we had total deposits of $7.75 billion compared to $6.68 billion at December 31, 2023, which reflected an increase of $1.07 billion, or 15.9%. Daily deposit balances are subject to variability, and deposits averaged

$7.55 
billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Savings and money market balances are a modest percentage of our funding and we have swept such deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions.
 Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. A diversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost than certain other types of funding, comprise the majority of our deposits. 
Our product mix includes prepaid card accounts for salary, medical spending, commercial, general purpose reloadable, corporate and other incentive, gift, government payments and transaction accounts accessed by debit cards. Balances are subject to daily fluctuations, which may comprise a significant component of variances between dates.

Our funding is comprised primarily of millions of small transaction-based consumer balances, the vast majority of which are FDIC-insured. We have multi-year, contractual relationships with affinity groups which sponsor such accounts and with whom we have had long-term relationships (see Item 1. “
Business—Our Strategies
”). Those long-term relationships comprise the majority of our deposits while we continue to grow and add new client relationships. Of our deposits at year-end 2024, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $3.79 billion, the next three largest $1.64 billion, and the four subsequent largest $756.9 million. Of our deposits at year-end 2023, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.33 billion, the next three largest $1.46 billion, and the four subsequent largest $852.1 million. While certain of these relationships may have changed their ranking in the top ten, the affinity groups themselves were identical in both years. We believe that payroll, debit, and government-based accounts such as child support are comparable to traditional consumer checking accounts. Such balances in the top ten relationships at year-end 2024, totaled $3.81 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring incentive and gift card payments, amounted to $2.38 billion. Such balances in the top ten relationships at year-end 2023, totaled $2.91 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring incentive and gift card payments, amounted to $1.72 billion. 
We pay interest directly to consumer account holders for an immaterial amount of deposit balances, while the vast majority of interest expense results from fees paid to affinity groups. While affinity groups may decide to pay interest or other remuneration to account holders, they do not currently do so for the vast majority of balances.
 The vast majority of payments to affinity groups are variable rate and equate to varying contractual percentages tied to the effective federal funds rate, which results from Federal Reserve rate hikes and reductions. 
The effective federal funds rate also reflects a market rate which might be required to replace lower cost deposits, or fund loan growth in excess of deposit growth, at least in the short-term. 
Because underlying balances have generally exhibited stability, so too have trends in the cost of funds. The more consequential impact to cost of funds are market changes and the effective federal funds rate, specifically the impact of Federal Reserve rate hikes and reductions. We model significant fee-based relationships in our net interest income sensitivity modeling (see “Asset and Liability Management”). The following discussion is applicable to our transaction accounts, comprising the majority of our deposits, in the 100 and 200 basis point rate increase and decrease scenarios as presented in the applicable table in that Asset and Liability Management section. The impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes or reductions, which respectively increase or decrease interest expense, has approximated the ratio of our cost of funds divided by the effective federal funds rate, all else equal. However, there can be no assurance that such ratios could not change significantly given the other variables discussed in the Asset and Liability Management section. In 2024, our demand and interest checking balances averaged $6.88 billion, compared to $6.31 billion in 2023. The growth primarily reflected increases in payment company balances. Average savings and money market balances continue to comprise a modest portion of funding and increased to $111.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $46.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023
. In 2023, we did not use short-term time deposits after the first quarter of the year and used no such deposits in 2024. Such deposits have been utilized in the past when loan growth has exceeded deposit growth. Short-term time deposits are generated through established intermediaries such as banks and other financial companies. These deposits generally originate with investment or trust companies or banks, which offer those deposits at market rates either themselves or through intermediaries to FDIC-insured institutions, such that the balances are fully FDIC-insured. These deposits are generally classified as brokered.. The following table presents the average balance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

We do not have any policy prohibiting us from incurring debt, which may be used for stock repurchases or common stock cash dividends, although we historically have not paid such dividends. Additionally, we have issued subordinated debentures which are grandfathered to also constitute Tier 1 capital, but only at the Bank level. Those instruments are described below. We believe we are in compliance with any covenants applicable to our debt. 

Senior Debt

On August 13, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes, with a maturity date of August 15, 2025 and a 4.75% interest rate, with interest paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. The majority of these funds were utilized to repurchase common stock in 2021 and 2022. 
The 2025 Senior Notes are our direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. In lieu of repayment from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay maturing debt.

Subordinated Debentures

As of December 31, 2024, we had two established statutory business trusts: The Bancorp Capital Trust II and The Bancorp Capital Trust III, which we refer to as (“the Trusts”). In each case, we own all the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts issued preferred capital securities to investors and invested the proceeds in us through the purchase of the 2038 Debentures issued by us. The 2038 Debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. The $10.3 million of 2038 Debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust II and the $3.1 million of 2038 Debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust III were both issued on November 28,

2007, mature on March 15, 2038 and 
bear interest at SOFR plus 3.51%
. 

Other Long-term Borrowings

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had long-term borrowings of $14.1 million and $38.6 million respectively, which consisted of 
sold loans which were accounted for as secured borrowings, because they did not qualify for true sale accounting
. 

82

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities amounted to $68.0 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $69.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
Shareholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2024, we had $789.8 million in shareholders’ equity compared to $807.3 million at the prior year end. The increase primarily reflected 2024 net income, net of common stock repurchases and the change in the market value of securities. 
Segments
The Company’s operations can be classified under three segments: fintech, specialty finance and corporate. The fintech segment includes the deposit balances and non-interest income generated by prepaid, debit and other card accessed accounts, ACH proccessing and other payments related processing. It also includes loan balances and interest and non-interest income from credit products generated through payment relationships. Specialty finance includes: (i) REBL (real estate bridge lending) comprised primarily of apartment building rehabilitation loans (ii) institutional banking comprised primarily of security-backed lines of credit, cash value insurance policy-backed lines of credit and advisor financing and (iii) commercial loans comprised primarily of SBA loans and direct lease financing. It also includes deposits generated by those business lines.  Corporate includes the Company’s investment securities, corporate overhead and expenses which have not been allocated to segments. Expenses not allocated include certain management, board oversight, administrative, legal, IT and technology infrastructure, human resouces, audit, regulatory and CRA, finance and accounting, marketing and other corporate expenses. 
Segment financial results are shown in “Note T—Segment Financials” to the audited consolidated financial statements herein. Those financials reflect a market-based allocation of interest expense to financing segments which utilize funding from deposits generated by the fintech segment, which earns offsetting interest income. That allocation is shown in the “Interest allocation” line item. The rate utilized for the allocation corresponds to an estimated average of the three year FHLB rate. The fintech segment interest expense line item consists of interest expense actually incurred to generate its deposits, which is the Company’s actual cost of funds. That actual cost is allocated to the corporate segment which requires funding for the Company’s investment securities portfolio. 
The market-based funding based on the three year FHLB rate for the specialty finance categories as described above, results in a higher interest expense allocation for those lines of business in higher interest rate environments. That higher interest expense allocation results in higher interest income for the fintech segment to the extent that it provides related funding. Conversely, when that rate decreases, so too are interest expense for the lending lines of business and interest income for fintech.
Additionally, variances between periods can result from deposit growth within the fintech segment, and loan growth within the lending lines of business. Loan pricing on new loans, and repricing of variable rate loans may also result in variances between periods.
Off-balance Sheet Commitments 
We are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk for us, are our unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which were approximately $1.97 billion and $1.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The 

83

vast majority of commitments reflect SBLOC commitments, which are variable rate, and connected to lines of credit collateralized by marketable securities. The amount of those lines is generally based upon the value of the collateral, and not expected usage. The majority of those available lines have not been drawn upon, and SBLOC loans are “demand” loans and can be called at any time. 
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Since we expect that many of the commitments or letters of credit we issue will not be fully drawn upon, the total commitment or letter of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We base the amount of collateral we obtain when we extend credit on our credit evaluation of the customer. SBLOC commitments are limited to a percentage of the collateral value, which varies for equities and fixed income securities. For IBLOC, the commitment may be as high as the cash value of the applicable eligible life insurance policy. Collateral for other loan commitments varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.

Impact of Inflation 
The primary direct impact of inflation on our operations is on our operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services. While it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation and responsive Federal Reserve rate changes on our net interest income, the Federal Reserve has historically utilized interest rate increases in the overnight federal funds rate as one tool in fighting inflation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING 
FIRM

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Bancorp, Inc.
Wilmington, Delaware

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company 
as of 
December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter 
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) on Loans – Qualitative Factors 

As described in Note E to the financial statements, the Company estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available historical loan performance information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The loans are segregated by product type to recognize differing risk characteristics within portfolio segments. The Company develops the quantitative basis for estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans based on historical credit loss experience. The qualitative component of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan performance and is subjective. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $31.9 million.

86

We identified auditing the qualitative factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination that qualitative factors is a critical audit matter is due to the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity required to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant judgments in the selection and application of qualitative factors. 

 To address this matter, the primary procedures we performed included:


Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to qualitative factors, including the controls related to the following:

o
Management’s verification that qualitative factor adjustments are appropriately applied in the allowance for credit losses calculation;
o
Management’s judgments involved in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative factor framework and the determination of qualitative factor adjustments; and
o
Management’s evaluation over relevance and reliability of data used in the determination of qualitative factor adjustments.


Our substantive procedures related to qualitative factors, which included the following:

o
Evaluated the qualitative factor adjustments were appropriately applied in the allowance for credit losses calculation;
o
Evaluated the appropriateness of qualitative factor framework and reasonableness of management’s judgments related to the determination of qualitative factors adjustments applied in the allowance for credit losses; and
o
Evaluated the relevance and reliability of the data used in the determination of qualitative factor adjustments.

THE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note A—Organization and Nature of Operations 

The Bancorp, Inc. (“the Company”) is a Delaware corporation and a registered financial holding company. Its primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, National Association (“the Bank”). The Bank is a nationally chartered commercial bank located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured institution. As a nationally chartered institution, its primary regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank has 
two
 primary lines of business consisting of its national specialty finance segment and its fintech segment.

In the national specialty finance segment, the Bank makes the following types of loans: securities-backed lines of credit (“SBLOCs”), cash value of insurance-backed lines of credit (“IBLOCs”) and investment advisor financing; leases (direct lease financing); small business loans (“SBLs”), consisting primarily of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans; and non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans (“REBLs”). 
Consumer fintech lending is reflected in the payments segment.

While the national specialty finance segment generates the majority of the Company’s revenues, the payments segment also contributes significant revenues. In its payments segment, the Company provides payment and deposit services nationally, which include prepaid and debit card accounts, affinity group banking, deposit accounts to investment advisors’ customers, card payments and other payment processing services. Payments segment deposits fund the majority of the Company’s loans and securities and may produce lower costs than other funding sources. Most of the payments segment’s revenues and deposits, and SBLOC and IBLOC loans, result from relationships with third parties which market such products. Concentrations of loans and deposits are based upon the cumulative account balances generated by those third parties. Similar concentrations result in revenues in prepaid, debit card and related fees. These concentrations may also be reflected in a lower cost of funds compared to other funding sources. The Company sweeps certain deposits off its balance sheet to other institutions through intermediaries. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within its funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. 
In 2024, the Company began offering loans through credit sponsorship with third parties, in its fintech segment.
The Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by certain state and federal agencies and, accordingly, they are examined periodically by those regulatory authorities. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities, the Company’s and the Bank’s businesses are affected by state and federal legislation and regulations.
Note B—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

1. Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances have been eliminated.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The principal estimate that is particularly susceptible to a significant change in the near term relates to our allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans, leases and securities. This estimate, made in accordance with GAAP, involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty and has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  

94

2. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and amounts due from banks with an original maturity from date of purchase of three months or less and federal funds sold.

The Company maintains balances in excess of insured limits at various financial institutions including the Federal Reserve Bank (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and other private institutions. The Company does not believe these instruments carry a significant risk of loss, but cannot provide assurances that no losses could occur if these institutions were to become insolvent. 
3. Investment Securities

Investments in debt which management believes may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity requirements, or other factors, are classified as available-for-sale. Net unrealized gains for such securities, net of tax effect, are reported as other comprehensive income, through equity and are excluded from the determination of net income. The unrealized losses for available-for-sale securities are evaluated to determine if any component is attributable to credit loss versus market factors. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a provision for credit losses is recorded within the consolidated statement of operations. Subsequent improvement in credit may result in reversal of the credit charge in future periods. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. The Company does not engage in securities trading. Gains or losses on disposition of investment securities are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted carrying amount of the securities sold using the specific identification method
.
The Company evaluates whether an ACL is required by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral, and (e) the payment structure of the security. The Company’s determination of the best estimate of expected future cash flows, which is used to determine the credit loss amount, is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security. 
The Company concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, unrealized losses on securities reflected changes in market interest rates after the securities were purchased. 
The Company’s unrealized loss for debt securities is primarily related to general market conditions, including a lack of liquidity in the market. The severity of the impact of fair value in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with market developments. The Company’s analysis of each investment is performed at the security level. As a result of its quarterly review, the Company concluded that an allowance was not required to recognize credit losses in either 2024 or 2022. In 2023, the Company recognized a provision of $
10.0
 million for the total $
10.0
 million par value of the only trust preferred security in its portfolio, based upon limited financial and other information received from the issuer.
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, the issuer tendered an offer to repurchase these securities which the Company accepted. Accordingly, $
1.0
 million was recovered which resulted in a reversal of the provision for credit loss in that amount, and a charge-off of the remaining $
9.0
 million of the security.
4. Loans and ACL 
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified as held for investment and are stated at amortized cost, net of unearned discounts, unearned loan fees and an ACL. For loans held for investment at amortized cost, the Company, effective January 1, 2020, began to utilize a current expected credit loss (“CECL”), methodology to determine the ACL. 
CECL accounting replaced the prior incurred loss model that recognized losses when it became probable that a credit loss would be incurred, with a new requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or purchased. Accordingly, 
CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
  The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the ACL. 
The allowance is an amount that management believes is appropriate and supportable to absorb current and future expected losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.
 The evaluation takes into consideration historical losses by pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and qualitative factors such as portfolio performance and the potential impact of current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay. 
For most pools, 
the historical 

95

loss ratio 
for each pool is multiplied by its outstanding balance and further multiplied by the estimated remaining average life of each pool. A qualitative factor determined according to the pool’s risk characteristics, is multiplied by the pool’s outstanding principal to comprise the second component of its ACL.

For loans previously classified in discontinued operations, discounted cash flow is utilized to determine the related allowance. For SBLOC and IBLOC pools, which have not experienced significant credit losses, 
probability of loss/loss given default considerations and qualitative factors are utilized.
 Additionally, the allowance includes allocations for specific loans which have been individually evaluated for an ACL.
 Factors considered by management in determining the need for individual loan evaluation for a specific allowance include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not evaluated for an allowance for that reason alone. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. The determination of the amount of the allowance calculated on individual loans considers either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance allocation is established for such loans in the amount their carrying value exceeds the present value of future cash flows; or, if collateral dependent, the amount their carrying value exceeds the collateral’s estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company's allowances on individual loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral, and applicable loans are primarily found in two portfolios.
First, for 
small business 
commercial loans 
(“SBLs”)
 secured by real estate (primarily SBA), estimated fair values of collateral are determined primarily through third-party appraisals or evaluations. 
When a real estate secured loan is individually evaluated for a potential ACL, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. 
This decision is based on various considerations including the age of the most recent appraisal and the condition of the property. 
Appraised value, discounted 
by

the

estimated 
costs

to

sell

the collateral, is considered to be the estimated fair value. 
For SBL commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable or inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower's financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources may be discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. Amounts guaranteed by the U.S. government are excluded from the Company’s allowance evaluations. Second, for leasing, fair values are determined utilizing authoritative industry sources such as Black Book.
The CECL methodology and the loan analyses performed on individual loans described above comprise the components of the ACL. On a quarterly basis, the allowance is adjusted to the total of those components through the provision for credit losses. 
The ACL represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans and leases. If the quarterly analysis of those two components exceeds the balance of the ACL, the allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the ACL, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. Because all identified losses are immediately charged off, no portion of the ACL is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.

The evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL includes, among other factors, an analysis of historical loss rates and qualitative judgments, applied to current loan totals over remaining estimated lives. 
However, actual future losses may vary compared to historical trends and estimated remaining lives may change over time. 
Actual losses on specified problem loans, may depend upon disposition of collateral for which actual sales prices may differ from appraisals. 
This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
Interest income is accrued as earned on a simple interest method. Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. 
When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all accumulated accrued interest receivable is reversed from income on a timely basis. Loans reported as having missed four or more consecutive monthly payments and still accruing interest must have both principal and accruing interest adequately secured and must be in the process of collection. Such loans are reported as 90 days 

96

delinquent and still accruing. For all loan types, the Company uses the method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan past due or delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date. In the Company’s reporting, two missed payments are reflected as 30 to 59 day delinquencies and three missed payments are reflected as 60 to 89 day delinquencies. 
Loans which were originated and previously intended for sale in secondary markets, but which are now being held on the balance sheet as earning assets, are carried at estimated fair value and are excluded from the allowance analysis. Changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains or losses on commercial loans in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company originated and sold or securitized specific commercial mortgage loans in secondary markets through 2019, but in 2020 decided to retain these loans on its balance sheet. These loans are accounted for under the fair value option and amounted to $
223.1
 million at December 31, 2024, and $
332.8
 million at December 31, 2023. These loans are classified as commercial loans, at fair value o
n the consolidated balance sheets
. 
5. Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the related leases.
6. Internal Use Software 
The Company capitalizes costs associated with internally developed and/or purchased software systems for new products and enhancements to existing products that have reached the application stage and meet recoverability tests. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll and payroll related expenses for employees who are directly associated with, and devote time to, the internal use software project. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The carrying value of the Company’s software is periodically reviewed and a loss is recognized if the value of the estimated undiscounted cash flow benefit related to the asset falls below the unamortized cost. Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related software, which is generally 
seven years
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net capitalized software costs of approximately $
5.0
 million and $
4.7
 million, respectively. 
Net capitalized software is presented as part of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
 The Company recorded related amortization expense of approximately $
1.1
 million, $
1.6
 million and $
2.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
7. Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between their carrying values on the consolidated balance sheet and their tax basis as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company recognizes the benefit of a tax position in the consolidated financial statements only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit by the tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. For these analyses, the Company may engage attorneys to provide opinions related to the positions. The Company applies this policy to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remain open, but this application does not materially impact the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operations. Any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statement of operations.
Deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their net realizable value. The Company performs an assessment each reporting period to evaluate the amount of the deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize. Realization of 

97

deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods, as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized. If a valuation allowance is required, the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
8. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) in accordance with ASC 718. The fair value of the option or RSU is generally measured on the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is usually the stated vesting period. For options subject to a service condition, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of such options on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes model takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility, the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested. In accordance with ASC 718, the Company estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. 
9. Other Real Estate Owned
Other
 real estate owned (“OREO”) is recorded at estimated fair market value less estimated cost of disposal; which establishes a new cost basis or carrying value. When property is acquired, the excess, if any, of the loan balance over fair market value is charged to the ACL. Periodically thereafter, the asset is reviewed for subsequent declines in the estimated fair market value against the carrying value. Subsequent declines, if any, and holding costs, as well as gains and losses on subsequent sale, are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Expenditures for OREO properties that extend it’s useful life or capacity are capitalized. T
he Company had $
62.0
 million of OREO at December 31, 2024 and $
16.9
 million at December 31, 2023.
10. Advertising Costs 

The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs amounted to $
858,000
, $
978,000
 and $
1.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advertising and marketing expense is reflected under “Other” in the non-interest expense section of the consolidated statements of operations.
11. Earnings Per Share 
The Company calculates earnings per share under ASC 260, 
Earnings Per Share
. 
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities, including stock options and RSUs or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Stock options are dilutive if their exercise prices are less than the current stock prices. RSUs are dilutive because they represent grants over vesting periods which do not require employees to pay exercise prices. The dilution shown in the tables below includes the potential dilution from both stock options and RSUs.
The following tables show the Company’s earnings per share for the periods presented:

12. Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks 
Historically, the Bank has been required to maintain reserves against customer demand deposits by keeping cash on hand or balances with the FRB. Currently, no reserves are required.
13. 
Other Identifiable Intangible Assets 
In May 2016, the Company purchased approximately $
60.0
 million of lease receivables, which resulted in a customer list intangible of $
3.4
 million which is being amortized over a 
ten year
 period. Amortization expense is $
340,000
 per year ($
454,000
 over the next three years). The gross carrying value is $
3.4
 million with respective accumulated amortization of $
3.0
 million and $
2.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
In January 2020, the Company purchased McMahon Leasing and subsidiaries for approximately $
8.7
 million, which resulted in $
1.1
 million of intangibles. The gross carrying value of $
1.1
 million of intangibles was comprised of a customer list intangible of $
689,000
, goodwill of $
263,000
 and a trade name valuation of $
135,000
. The customer list intangible is being amortized over a 
twelve year
 period and accumulated amortization was $
287,000
 at December 31, 2024. Amortization expense is $
57,000
 per year ($
287,000
 over the next five years). The gross carrying value and accumulated amortization related to the Company’s intangibles at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented below.

14. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company has periodically utilized derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on fixed rate loans which were previously intended for sale. 
As the Company is no longer originating fixed rate loans for sale, it is no longer entering into new hedges. The  only hedge outstanding at December 31, 2023, for a notional amount of $
6.8
 million, was no longer outstanding at December 31, 2024. 
Under that swap agreement, the Company received an adjustable rate of interest based upon SOFR w
hile it paid a fixed rate. At December 31, 2023, those respective rates were 
2.16
% and 
5.59
%. The Company recorded a loss of $
285,000
, a loss of $
124,000
 and a gain of $
961,000
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments. Those amounts are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations under “Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans (at fair value)”. At December 31, 2023, the amount receivable by the Company under this swap agreement was $
285,000
. T
he Company had minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparty and had accordingly posted cash collateral of $
548,000
 at that date.

15. Common Stock Repurchase Program

Common stock repurchases in excess of additional paid-in-capital at the time of purchase are recorded as treasury stock, shown separately in the balance sheet. Treasury shares are accordingly excluded from earnings per share computation.

On October 20, 2021, the Board approved a revised stock repurchase program for the 2022 fiscal year (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), under which the Company purchased $
15.0
 million of shares in each quarter of 2022. The total of $
60.0
 million resulted in the repurchase of 
2,322,256
 shares of common stock at an average price of $
25.84
 per share.

On October 26, 2022, the Board approved a revised stock repurchase program for the 2023 fiscal year (the “2023 Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may repurchase shares totaling up to $
25.0
 million per quarter in 2023, for a maximum repurchase amount of $
100.0
 million. The total of $
100.0
 million resulted in the repurchase of 
2,957,146
 shares of common stock at an average price of $
33.82
 per share. 

On October 26, 2023, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2024 fiscal year (the “2024 Common Stock Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may repurchase shares totaling up to $
50.0
 million per quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $
200.0
 million.
 The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $
50.0
 million to $
100.0
 million, which increased the maximum amount under the 2024 
Common Stock
 Repurchase Program to $
250.0
 million.
 The total of $
250.0
 million resulted in the repurchase of 
6,237,270
 shares of common stock at an average price of $
40.08
 per share
. 

100

On October 23, 2024, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2025 fiscal year (the “2025 Repurchase Program”), which authorizes the Company to repurchase $
37.5
 million in value of the Company’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2025, for a maximum amount of $
150.0
 million. Under the 2025 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 The 2025 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated at any time.

16. Long-term Borrowings

The $
14.1
 million and $
38.6
 million outstanding for long-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted of 
sold loans which were accounted for as secured borrowings, because they did not qualify for true sale accounting.

17. Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue streams that are in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 include prepaid and debit card, card payment, interchange, 
a
utomated clearing house
 (“ACH”) 
and deposit processing and other fees. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligations related to the transfer of goods or services under the terms of a contract are satisfied. Some obligations are satisfied at a point in time while others are satisfied over a period of time. Revenue is recognized as the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. When consideration includes a variable component, the amount of consideration attributable to variability is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that significant revenue recognized will not be reversed when uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company’s contracts generally do not contain terms that require significant judgment to determine the variability impacting the transaction price.

A performance obligation is deemed satisfied when the control over goods or services is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred to a customer either at a point in time or over time. To determine when control is transferred at a point in time, the Company considers indicators, including but not limited to the right to payment for the asset, transfer of significant risk and rewards of ownership of the asset and acceptance of the asset by the customer. When control is transferred over a period of time, for different performance obligations, either the input or output method is used to measure progress for the transfer. The measure of progress used to assess completion of the performance obligation varies between performance obligations and may be based on time throughout the period of service or on the value of goods and services transferred to the customer. As each distinct service or activity is performed, the Company transfers control to the customer based on the services performed as the customer simultaneously receives the benefits of those services. This timing of revenue recognition aligns with the resolution of any uncertainty related to variable consideration. Costs incurred to obtain a revenue producing contract are amortized over the life of the contract if material, otherwise they are expensed as a practical expedient. The fees on those revenue streams are generally assessed and collected as the transaction occurs, or on a monthly or quarterly basis. The Company has completed its review of the contracts and other agreements that are within the scope of revenue guidance and did not identify any material changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The Company’s accounting policies did not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition in Accounting Standards Update (“
ASU”) 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers

are largely consistent with previous practices already implemented and applied by the Company. The vast majority of the Company’s services related to its revenues are performed, earned and recognized monthly. 

The majority of fees the Company earns result from contractual transaction fees paid by third-party sponsors to the Company and monthly service fees. Additionally, the Company earns interchange fees paid through settlement with associations such as Visa, which are also determined on a per transaction basis. The Company records this revenue net of costs such as association fees and interchange transaction charges. Fees earned by the Company from processing card payments, or from processing ACH payments or other payments are also determined primarily on a per transaction basis. 

Prepaid and debit card fees primarily include fees for services related to reconciliation, fraud detection, regulatory compliance and other services which are performed and earned daily or monthly and are also billed and collected on a monthly basis. Accordingly, there is no significant component of the services the Company performs or related revenues which are deferred. The Company earns transactional and/or interchange fees on prepaid and debit card accounts when transactions occur and revenue is billed and collected monthly or quarterly. Certain volume or transaction based interchange expenses paid to payment networks such as Visa, reduce revenue which is presented net on the income statement. Card payment and ACH processing fees include transaction fees earned for processing merchant transactions. Revenue is recognized when a cardholder’s transaction is approved and settled, or monthly. ACH processing fees are earned on a per item basis as the transactions are processed for third party clients and are also billed 

101

and collected monthly. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees and other charges the Company receives to provide various services, including but not limited to, account maintenance, check writing, wire transfer and other services normally associated with deposit accounts. Revenue for these services is recognized monthly as the services are performed. The Company’s customer contracts do not typically have performance obligations and fees are collected and earned when the transaction occurs. The Company may, from time to time, waive certain fees for customers but generally does not reduce the transaction price to reflect variability for future reversals due to the insignificance of the amounts. Waiver of fees reduces the revenue in the period the waiver is granted to the customer.

18. Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ROU assets represent the Company’s right-of-use of an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments pursuant to the Company’s leases. The ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

19. Senior Debt

On August 13, 2020, the Company issued $
100
 million of senior notes (the “2025 Senior Notes”) with a maturity date of 
August 15, 2025
 and a 
4.75
% interest rate, with interest paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. 
The 2025 Senior Notes are the Company’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

. 
 Charge-offs of certain consumer fintech loans 

Lending agreements related to consumer fintech loans had certain charge-offs accounted for as freestanding credit enhancements which resulted in the company recording a $
19.6
 million provision for credit losses and a correlated amount in non-interest income resulting in no impact to net income.

21. Consumer credit fintech fees

Consumer credit fintech fees are comprised of fees paid by third-party marketers and servicers related to loans made by the Bank, which earns such fees based generally on average loan balances. 

22. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, 
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses

(Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.

This ASU
 addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of the credit losses standard (ASU 2016-13) that introduced the CECL model. The amendments eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhance the disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and modifications. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2023 loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are required to be disclosed by type of modification and by type of loan. Prior accounting guidance classified loans which were modified as troubled debt restructurings only if the modification reflected a concession from the lender in the form of a below market interest rate or other concession in addition to borrower financial difficulty. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
ASU 2023-07 enhances segment level disclosures, for both annual and quarterly reporting periods and is effective with the December 31, 2024 financial statements. As a result of the enhancements, segment disclosures now include greater detail surrounding the nature of expenses previously reported as a single line item in the segment income statements. In addition to disclosing the chief operational decision maker by title and position, an explanation of how the segment information is used by that decision maker is now included. 

102

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09, effective January 1, 2025, adds annual disclosures for the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, shown separately for federal, state and foreign taxes. Total tax paid, net of refunds, for any jurisdictions which exceed 5% of total net taxes paid, will also be shown separately. The Company is currently evaluating these disclosures
.

Note C— Subsequent Events

The Company evaluated its December 31, 2024 
consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. 
The Company is not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Note D—Investment Securities 
Fair values of available-for-sale securities are based on the fair market values supplied by a third-party market data provider, or where such third-party market data is not available, fair values are based on discounted cash flows. The third-party market data provider uses a pricing matrix which it creates daily, taking into consideration actual trade data, projected prepayments, and when relevant, projected credit defaults and losses.
The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair values of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

CECL accounting requires that an ACL be established through a charge to the income statement to recognize credit deterioration. The charge may be reversed should credit improve in the future. Prior accounting required recognition of losses of other-than temporary-impairment, which could not be reversed in future periods. The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether an ACL is warranted, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers/guarantors, the underlying collateral if applicable and the continuing performance of the securities. The Company did 
no
t recognize credit charges on investment securities in either 2024 or 2022. In 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit loss on a security as follows.
The Company owned 
one
 single issuer trust preferred security issued by an insurance company through the third quarter of 2024, which was purchased in 2006, and owns no other such security or similar security. In the fourth quarter of 2023,
 the Bank provided for a potential loss for the full amount of the $
10.0
 million par value of the security through a provision for credit loss of $
10.0
 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, the issuer tendered an offer to repurchase these securities which the Company accepted. Accordingly, $
1.0
 million was recovered which resulted in a reversal of the provision for credit loss in that amount, and a charge-off of the remaining $
9.0
 million of the security.
The Company has evaluated the securities in the above tables as of December 31, 2024 and has concluded that, except for the trust preferred security discussed above for which the ACL was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2024, 
no
ne of these securities required an ACL.
The Company evaluates whether an ACL is required by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral and (e) the payment structure of the security. The Company’s determination of the best estimate of expected future cash flows, which is used to determine the credit loss amount, is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security. With the exception of the trust preferred security discussed above and the CRE-2 security discussed in 
“Note E—Loans”
, the Company concluded that the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are in a loss position because of changes in market interest rates after the securities were purchased. The severity of the impact of fair value in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with market developments. The Company’s analysis of each investment is performed at the security level and the Company intends to hold its investment securities to maturity.

Loans

The Company has several lending lines of business including: SBLs, comprised primarily of SBA loans; direct lease financing primarily for commercial vehicles and to a lesser extent equipment; SBLOC collateralized by marketable securities; IBLOC collateralized by the cash value of eligible life insurance policies; and investment advisor financing for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. 
In 2024, the Company began making consumer fintech loans which consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with marketers and servicers. 
Prior to 2020, the Company also originated non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel and retail properties, for sale into securitizations. At origination, the Company elected fair value treatment for these loans as they were originally held-for-sale, to better reflect the economics of the transactions. In 2020, the Company decided to retain these loans on its balance sheet as interest-earning assets and currently intends to continue doing so. Therefore, these loans are no longer accounted for as held-for-sale, but the Company continues to present them at fair value. These loans are included in commercial loans, at fair value which, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, amounted to $
223.1
 million and $
332.8
 million, respectively, with an amortized cost of $
223.5
 million and $
336.5
 million, respectively. Those totals also include the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans, also previously held for sale. Included in 
net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans, at fair value
 in the consolidated statements of operations are changes in the fair value of such loans resulting in an unrealized loss of $
683,000
 in 2024, an unrealized loss of $
3.1
 million in 2023 and an unrealized loss of $
6.1
 million in 2022. These amounts include unrealized credit related losses of $
867,000
, $
1.7
 million and $
7.7
 million, respectively, in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Interest earned on loans held at fair value during the period held is recorded in 
“Interest Income – Loans,
 including fees” in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The $
1.7
 million credit related unrealized loss in 2023 resulted from a non-controlling participation in a multifamily apartment building.

Included in the $
6.1
 million loss in 2022 was a $
4.0
 million third quarter unrealized loss to reflect a write-down to a September 2022 appraisal, less estimated disposition costs, of a $
9.5
 million loan. The loan, collateralized by a movie theater, had been current and performing but missed its August 2022 payment, and the tenant ceased operations in that month. The property was subsequently transferred to OREO, and the unrealized loss was realized in 2023 upon sale of the property. The loan represented the only movie theater loan in the Company’s portfolios and was originated in 2015, before non-SBA commercial loan originations were primarily comprised of apartment building loans. Of the $
2.21
 billion of non-SBA commercial (bridge) loans, at fair value and REBL loans which together comprise the non-SBA commercial real estate portfolios, $
2.17
 billion are comprised of apartment building loans. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the Company resumed the origination of such loans which it also intends to hold for investment and which are accounted for at amortized cost. They are captioned as REBLs as they are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties which already have cash flow.

The Bank has pledged the majority of its loans held for investment at amortized cost and commercial loans, at fair value to either the FHLB or the Federal Reserve Bank for lines of credit with those institutions. The amount of loans pledged varies and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent the collateral exceeds advances. The lines are maintained consistent with the Bank’s liquidity policy which maximizes potential liquidity. 
At December 31, 2024, $
2.46
 billion of loans were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank and $
2.22
 billion of loans were pledged to the FHLB against lines of credit which provide a source of liquidity to the Bank. 
There were 
no
 amounts drawn against these lines at December 31, 2024
. 

Of the 
six
 securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial mortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was  reduced from $
12.6
 million to $
3.5
 million as a result of the sale of one of the two remaining collateral properties
. The $
3.5
 million remains in non-accrual status. While the appraised value of the remaining property allocable to the Bank’s security exceeds the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the amounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of these properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition costs. 

The Company analyzes credit risk prior to making loans on an individual loan basis. The Company considers relevant aspects of the borrowers’ financial position and cash flow, past borrower performance, management’s knowledge of market conditions, collateral and the ratio of loan amounts to estimated collateral value in making its credit determinations. For SBLOC, the Company relies on the market value of the underlying securities collateral as adjusted by margin requirements, generally 
50
% for equities and 
80
% for investment grade securities. For IBLOC, the Company relies on the cash value of insurance policy collateral. Of the total 
$
454.4
 million of consumer fintech loans at December 31, 2024, $
201.1
 million consisted of secured credit card loans, with the balance consisting of other short-term extensions of credit. Consumers do not pay interest on the majority of consumer fintech loan balances, including secured credit card loans. The majority of the income on those loans is reflected in non-interest income under “Consumer credit fintech fees” and originate with the marketers and servicers for those loans. The secured credit card balances were 

106

collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact reflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use. Related fee income is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.

 The majority of the increase in Loans past due 90 days or more in 2024 compared to the prior year resulted from a $

In the first quarter of 2024, a $
39.4
 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status to OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at December 31, 2024, with a balance at that date of $
41.1
 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. That property is under agreement of sale with a sales price that is expected to cover the Company’s current balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. The purchaser has increased the total of earnest money deposits to $
1.6
 million, from $
500,000
, in consideration of extending the closing date to March 21, 2025. The Company believes that the purpose for the extension is to allow time for this sale to be included in a larger transaction. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, the earnest money deposits of $
1.6
 million would accrue to the Company.  The nonaccrual balances in this table as of December 31, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.

Interest
 which would have been earned on loans classified as non-accrual at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $
1.1
 million and $
738,000
, respectively. 
No
 income on non-accrual loans was recognized during 2024 or 2023. In 2024,

$
1.0
 million of REBL, $
161,000
 of direct leasing, $
130,000
 of SBL commercial real estate, $
38,000
 of SBL non-real estate, and $
14,000
 of IBLOC
 were reversed from interest income, which represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period.
 In 2023,
 $
89,000
 of legacy commercial real estate, $
89,000
 of SBL commercial real estate, $
44,000
 of SBL non-real estate, $
13,000
 of IBLOC, and $
110,000
 of direct leasing were reversed from interest income, which represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period
. 
In the third quarter of 2024 $
815,000
 of interest was reversed from interest income as a result of REBL loan modifications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, approximately $
1.3
 million was reversed in connection with a loan sale.

L
oans which are experiencing financial stress are reviewed by the loan review department, which is independent of the lending lines. 
The review includes an analysis for a potential specific reserve allocation in the ACL. 
For REBLs, updated appraisals are generally obtained in conjunction with modifications. 

During the year to date periods ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, loans modified and related information are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Percentage represents the principal of loans deferred divided by the principal of the total loan portfolio.

There were 
no
 loans that received a term extension modification which had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before 
default.

The Company had 
no
 commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified as of either December 31, 2024 or 2023
. 

As of December 31, 2024, there were $
75.7
 million of loans classified as modified with specific reserves of $
768,000
, while there were $
13.1
 million of loans classified as modified as of December 31, 2023 with specific reserves of $
127,000
.

Management estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to determine the quantitative component of the reserve and current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine the qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit loss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative component of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan performance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors for review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given default, and the other loan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are determined by establishing reserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of collateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated fair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs
.

Below are the portfolio segments used to pool loans with similar risk characteristics and align with the Company’s methodology for measuring expected credit losses. These pools have similar risk and collateral characteristics, and certain of these pools are broken down further in determining and applying the vintage loss estimates previously discussed. For instance, within the direct lease financing pool, government and public institution leases are considered separately.
 Additionally, the Company evaluates its loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. The special mention classification indicates weaknesses that may, if not cured, threaten the borrower’s future repayment ability. A substandard classification reflects an existing weakness indicating the possible inadequacy of net worth and other repayment sources. These classifications are used both by regulators and peers, as they have been correlated with an increased probability of credit losses. Increases in substandard loans do not necessarily require increased provisions for credit losses or allowance allocations on the basis of loan-to-value and other considerations based upon assessments by the loan review department which is independent of the lending lines. 
A summary of the Company’s primary portfolio pools and loans accordingly classified, by year of origination, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Included in Other loans are $
11.3
 million of SBA loans purchased for CRA purposes as of December 31, 2023. These loans are classified as SBL in the Company’s loan table, which classifies loans by type, as opposed to risk characteristics
.

A description of 
major loan categories is as follows.

SBL
. 
Substantially all 
SBLs consist of SBA loans. The Bank participates in loan programs established by the SBA, including the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program (the “7(a) Program”), the 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program (the “504 Program”), and 
the discontinued PPP
. The 7(a) Program is designed to help small business borrowers start or expand their businesses by providing partial guarantees of loans made by banks and non-bank lending institutions for specific business purposes, including long- or short- term working capital; funds for the purchase of equipment, machinery, supplies and materials; funds for the purchase, construction or renovation of real estate; and funds to acquire, operate or expand an existing business or refinance existing debt, all under conditions established by the SBA. The 504 Program includes the financing of real estate and commercial 
mortgages. In 2020 and 2021, the Company also participated in the PPP, which provided short-term loans to small businesses. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. This program was a specific response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the vast majority of these loans have been reimbursed by the U.S. government, with $
1.5
 million remaining to be reimbursed as of December 31, 2024. The Company
 segments the SBL portfolio into four pools: non-real estate, commercial mortgage and construction to capture the risk characteristics of each pool, and the PPP loans discussed above. PPP loans are not included in the risk pools because they have inherently different risk characteristics due to the U.S. government guarantee. In the table above, the PPP loans are included in non-rated SBL non-real estate.

Direct lease financing
. 
The Company
 provides lease financing for commercial and government vehicle fleets and, to a lesser extent, provides lease financing for other equipment. Leases are either open-end or closed-end. An open-end lease is one in which, at the end of the lease term, the lessee must pay the difference between the amount at which the Company sells the leased asset and the stated termination value. Termination value is a contractual value agreed to by the parties at the inception of a lease as to the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. A closed-end lease is one for which no such payment is due on lease termination. In a closed-end lease, the risk that the amount received on a sale of the leased asset will be less than the residual value is assumed by the Bank, as lessor.

SBLOC
. 
SBLOC loans are made to individuals, trusts and other entities and are secured by a pledge of marketable securities maintained in one or more accounts for which the Company obtains a securities account control agreement. The securities pledged may be either debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, but all such securities must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. SBLOCs are typically payable on demand. Maximum SBLOC line amounts are calculated by applying a standard “advance rate” calculation against the eligible security type depending on asset class: typically, up to 
50
% for equity securities and mutual fund securities and 
80
% for investment grade (Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or higher, or Moody’s rating of Baa3 or higher) municipal or corporate debt securities. Substantially all SBLOCs have full recourse to the borrower. The underlying securities collateral for SBLOC loans is monitored on a daily basis to confirm the composition of the client portfolio and its daily market value.

IBLOC. 
IBLOC loans are collateralized by the cash surrender value of eligible insurance policies. Should a loan default, the primary risks for IBLOCs are if the insurance company issuing the policy were to become insolvent, or if that company would fail to recognize the Bank’s assignment of policy proceeds. To mitigate these risks, insurance company ratings are periodically evaluated for compliance with Bank standards. Additionally, the Bank utilizes assignments of cash surrender value, which legal counsel has concluded are enforceable. 

Investment advisor financing
. In 2020, the Company began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to 
70
% of the estimated business enterprise value, based on a third-party valuation, but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained as appropriate. 
Loan repayment is highly dependent on fee streams from advisor clientele. Accordingly, loss of fee-based investment advisory clients or negative market performance may reduce fees and pose a risk to these credits.

Real estate bridge loans. 
Real estate bridge loans are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties which already have cash flow, and which are collateralized by those properties. Prior to 2020, such loans were originated for securitization and loans which had been originated but not securitized continue to be accounted for at fair value in “Commercial loans, at fair value”, on the balance sheet. In 2021, originations resumed and are being held for investment in “Loans, net of deferred fees and costs”, on the balance sheet. 
The Bancorp has minimal exposure to non-multifamily commercial real 

114

estate such as office buildings, and instead has a portfolio largely comprised of rehabilitation bridge loans for apartment buildings. These loans generally have 
three
-year terms with 
two

one
-year extensions to allow for the rehabilitation work to be completed and rentals stabilized for an extended period, before being refinanced at lower rates through U.S. Government Sponsored Entities or other lenders. The rehabilitation real estate lending portfolio consists primarily of workforce housing, which the Company considers to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates.  

Consumer fintech loans. 
Consumer fintech loans consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with marketers and servicers. The majority of secured credit card balances are collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact reflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use. Fee income for consumer fintech loans is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement
. As a result of credit enhancements on consumer fintech loans, $
19.6
 million of related charge-offs correlated with $
19.6
 million of non-interest income.  Year-to-date through February 28, 2025, $
28.6
 million of delinquent consumer fintech loans were fully participated and 
no
 charge-offs were recorded. 

Other loans. 
Other loans include commercial and HELOC which the Company generally no longer offers.

Expected credit losses are estimated over the estimated remaining lives of loans. The estimate excludes possible extensions, renewals and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation that a loan will be restructured, or the extension or renewal options are included in the borrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable by us. 

The Company does not measure an ACL on accrued interest receivable balances, because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to interest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status. The Company does not expect material amounts of accrued interest receivable for prior year periods to be reversed. 

ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate considers the likelihood that funding will occur over the estimated life of the commitment. The amount of the ACL in the liability account as of December 31, 2024 was $
2.0
 million.

A detail of the changes in the ACL by loan category and summary of loans evaluated individually and collectively for credit deterioration is as follows (dollars in thousands):

The non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulties (
and not from administrative delays or other mitigating factors
), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the ACL for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values. 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any significant changes to the extent to which collateral secures its collateral dependent loans due to general collateral deterioration or from other factors. SBL non-real estate are collateralized by business assets, which may include certain real estate. SBL commercial mortgage and construction are collateralized by real estate for small businesses, while real estate bridge lending is primarily collateralized by apartment buildings, or other commercial real estate. SBLOC is collateralized by marketable investment securities while IBLOC is collateralized by the cash value of life insurance. Advisor financing is collateralized by investment advisors’ business franchises. Direct lease financing is collateralized primarily by vehicles, or equipment.

The $
12.3
 million shown in the non-accrual column for real estate bridge loans was repaid on January 2, 2025 without loss of principal. 
The table above does not include an $
11.2
 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would no longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 
84
% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 
62
%. Since 2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously. 
In January 2025, 
two
 loans totaling $
9.8
 million were transferred to non-accrual and were accordingly classified as substandard.

Note H—Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”)

VIE’s are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.

The most common type of VIE is a special purpose entity (“SPE”). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE with the SPE funding the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The agreements that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The following table shows the Company’s remaining interest in the CRE-2 security, which represents a single security purchased by the Company in the securitizations for which the Company generated all of the commercial mortgage-backed loan collateral (dollars in thousands).

3. Guaranteed preferred beneficiary interest in the Company’s subordinated debt 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 
two
 statutory business trusts: The Bancorp Capital Trust II and The Bancorp Capital Trust III (the “Trusts”). In each case, the Company owns all the common securities of the Trust. The Trusts issued preferred capital securities to investors and invested the proceeds in the Company through the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (the “2038 Debentures”). The 2038 Debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. The $
10.3
 million of 2038 Debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust II and the $
3.1
 million of 2038 Debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust III were both issued on 
November 28,

2007
, mature on 
March 15, 2038
 and 
bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 
3.51
%
. 

As of December 31, 2024, the Trusts qualify as VIEs under ASC 810, 
Consolidation
. However, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary and, therefore, the Trusts are not consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Trusts are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
4. Senior debt

 On August 13, 2020, the Company issued $
100.0
 million of 2025 Senior Notes, which have a maturity date of 
August 15, 2025
, and a 
4.75
% interest rate, with interest paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. 
The 2025 Senior Notes are the Company’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

123

Note J—Shareholders’ Equity 

As a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $
40.0
 million, $
60.0
 million, $
100.0
 million, and $
250.0
 million respectively, in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 with $
150.0
 million planned for 2025. The planned amounts of such repurchases are determined in the fourth quarter of the preceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on regulatory capital requirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts required to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital return to shareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A significant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases in the amounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In determining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends, the Company calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon comparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations, with further consideration of internal growth projections. As these share prices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has consisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons are based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of returns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at any time, should capital need to be conserved.

Note K—Benefit Plans 

401 (k) Plan 

The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all employees of the Company. Under the plan, the Company 
matches

50
% of the employee contributions for all participants, not to exceed 
6
% of their salary. Contributions made by the Company were approximately $
2.4
 million, $
2.3
 million and $
2.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively and are reflected in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statement of operations.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
In 2005, the Company began contributing to a supplemental executive retirement plan for its former Chief Executive Officer that provides annual retirement benefits of $
25,000
 per month until death. There were $
300,000
 of disbursements under the plan in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. The actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 reflected respective discount rates of 
5.11
%, 
4.56
% and 
4.73
% with a monthly benefit of $
25,000
. Projected payouts for years one, two, three, four, and five are $
300,000
, $
281,000
, $
267,000
, $
252,000
, and $
236,000
, respectively, and $
912,000
 for the subsequent five years. The Company adjusts its related liability to actuarially derived estimates of lifetime payouts based upon actuarial tables as follows: SOA Pri-2012 Amount-Weighted White Collar Retiree Mortality Table with Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021. The Company’s related expense was $
300,000
, $
300,000
 and $
300,000
, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued $
3.0
 million for potential future payouts.

Management assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to recognize the existing deferred tax assets. If that threshold is not met, a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset. The federal and state valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was $
5.7
 million and $
6.3
 million and resulted from Walnut Street assets, primarily because related capital losses will likely be non-deductible. Walnut Street reflected the Bank’s prior investment in an entity through which a portion of its discontinued loan portfolio was sold. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Management does not believe these amounts will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of December 31, 2024. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, will impact the effective tax rate. 

125

Tax years after 2021 remain subject to examination by the federal authorities, and 2020 and after remain subject to examination by most state tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense for all periods presented. To date, 
no
 amounts of interest or penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded.

Note M—Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and RSUs in accordance with FASB ASC 718, 
Stock Based Compensation.
 The expense of the option or RSU is generally measured at fair value at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is typically the vesting period. For option grants subject to a service condition, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes model takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility, the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested. In accordance with ASC 718, the Company estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered
. For RSUs, fair value is determined by the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq as of the date of grant. 

At 
December
 31, 2024, the Company had 
three
 active stock-based compensation plans: The Bancorp, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”) The Bancorp, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) and The Bancorp, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”).

The 2024 Plan was adopted in May 2024. Employees and directors of the Company and the Bank and consultants (with restrictions) are eligible to participate in the 2024 Plan. 
Terms of options granted under the 2024 Plan may not exceed 
10

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock and peer group comparisons over the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (“STRIPS”) rate in effect at the time of the grant. The life of the option is based on historical factors which include the contractual term, vesting period, exercise behavior and employee terminations. In accordance with the ASC 718, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As only one individual has outstanding options, the Company estimates outstanding lives utilizing acceptable expedients in lieu of forfeiture history.

Note N—Transactions with Affiliates 

The Bank did 
no
t maintain any deposits for various affiliated companies as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Bank has entered into lending transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliates of such persons. All loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender. At December 31, 2024, these loans were current as to principal and interest payments, and did not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

      Legal Proceedings 

On June 12, 2019, the Bank was served with a qui tam lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County. The Delaware Department of Justice intervened in the litigation. The case is titled 
The State of Delaware, Plaintiff, Ex rel. Russell S. Rogers, Plaintiff-Relator v. The Bancorp Bank, Interactive Communications International, Inc., and InComm Financial Services, Inc., Defendants
. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated the Delaware False Claims Act by not paying balances on certain open-loop “Vanilla” prepaid cards to the State of Delaware as unclaimed property. The complaint seeks actual and treble damages, statutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees. The Bank has filed an answer denying the allegations and continues to vigorously defend against the claims. The Bank and other defendants previously filed a motion to dismiss the action, but the motion was denied and the case is in the midst of the first phase of discovery. The Company is unable to determine whether the ultimate resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operations
.

On September 14, 2021, Cachet Financial Services (“Cachet”) filed an adversary proceeding against the Bank in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, titled 
Cachet Financial Services, Plaintiff v. The Bancorp Bank, et al., Defendants
. The case was filed within the context of Cachet’s pending Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The Bank previously served as the Originating Depository Financial Institution (“ODFI”) for ACH transactions in connection with Cachet’s payroll services business. The matter arises from the Bank’s termination of its Payroll Processing ODFI Agreement with Cachet on October 23, 2019, for safety and soundness reasons. The initial complaint alleges eight causes of action: (i) breach of contract; (ii) negligence; (iii) intentional interference with contract; (iv) conversion; (v) express indemnity; (vi) implied indemnity; (vii) accounting; and (viii) objection to the Bank’s proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. On November 4, 2021, the Bank filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court, which was denied in February 2023. On August 3, 2022, Cachet served the Bank with a First Amended Complaint wherein Cachet, among other things, withdraws its implied indemnity claim against the Bank and adds several defendants unaffiliated with the Bank and causes of action related to those parties. As to the Bank, Cachet seeks approximately $
150
 million in damages, an accounting and disallowance of the Bank’s proof of claim. The Bank is vigorously defending against these claims. On September 28, 2022, the Bank filed a partial motion to dismiss, seeking to dispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims against the Bank. On September 12, 2024, the Bank’s partial motion to dismiss, seeking to dispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims was denied on procedural grounds and without reaching the issues the Bank raised in its partial motion to dismiss. On October 31, 2024, Cachet filed its Second Amended Complaint, which as related to the Bank, is substantially similar to the First Amended Complaint; however, the Second Amended Complaint seeks only “damages in amount to be proven at trial” whereas the First Amended Complaint sought “damages in amount to be proven but in no event less than $
150
 million.” The Bank is vigorously defending against the Second Amended Complaint. In furtherance of such a defense, on December 17, 2024, the Bank filed its partial motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or operations
. 

On March 27, 2023, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) seeking documents and information related to the Bank’s escheatment practices in connection with certain accounts offered through one of the Bank’s program partners. The Bank continues to cooperate with the CFPB, including by responding to the CID. While the Company remains confident in the Bank’s escheatment practices, it cannot predict the timing or final outcome of the investigation. Future costs related to this matter may be material and could continue to be material at least through the completion of the investigation
.

On November 21, 2023, TBBK Card Services, Inc. (“TBBK Card”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, captioned 
People of the State of California, acting by and through San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, Plaintiff v. InComm Financial Services, Inc., TBBK Card Services, Inc., Sutton Bank, Pathward, N.A., and Does 1-10, Defendants
.  The complaint principally alleges that the defendants engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts and practices related to the packaging of “Vanilla” prepaid cards and the refund process for unauthorized transactions that occurred due to card draining practices.  On December 14, 2023, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On March 26, 2024, the case was remanded to the Superior Court of the State of California. TBBK Card is vigorously defending against the claims. On May 6, 2024, TBBK Card filed a motion to quash service of summons as to 

129

TBBK Card for lack of personal jurisdiction, which is still pending. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or operations
.

In addition, we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations
. 

Note P—Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become payable. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contractual, or notional, amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. 

The approximate contract amounts and maturity term of the Company’s unused credit commitments are as follows:

December 31,

2024

2023

(Dollars in thousands)
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk

Commitments to extend credit

1,785,050
Standby letters of credit

$

1,975,635

$

1,786,748
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. The vast majority of commitments to extend credit arise from SBLOC which are variable rate and which represent collateral values available to support additional extensions of credit, and not expected usage. 
Such 
commitments are normally based on the full amount of collateral in a customer’s investment account. 
The majority of such lines of credit have historically not been drawn upon.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds residential or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The Company reduces any potential liability on its standby letters of credit based upon its estimate of the proceeds obtainable upon the liquidation of the collateral held. Fair values of unrecognized financial instruments, including commitments to extend credit and the fair value of letters of credit, are considered immaterial. 
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. CECL accounting guidance requires the establishment of an allowance for loss on such unfunded instruments. To establish that allowance, the Company generally utilizes the same methodologies as it does to establish allowances on outstanding loans, adjusted for estimated usage as appropriate.

Note Q—Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
ASC 825, 
Financial Instruments
, requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity’s assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. For the Company, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered to be financial instruments. However, many such instruments lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Also, it is the Company’s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity whether or not categorized as “available-for-sale” and not to engage in trading or sales activities although it sold loans in 2019 and prior years and may do so in the future. For fair value disclosure purposes, the Company utilized the fair value measurement criteria 
of ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (“ASC 820”)
. 
ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to assets and 
liabilities. It clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures concerning fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Level 1 valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities to which the Company has access at the measurement date. Level 2 valuation is based on other observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes quoted prices for similar assets in active or inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, default rates, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated through, observable market data by market-corroborated reports. Level 3 valuation is based on “unobservable inputs” that are the best information available in the circumstances. Assets classified as level 3 are only classified as such, when the observable inputs discussed above are not available, often as a result of thinly traded markets. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There were 
no
 transfers between levels in 2024 and 2023. or fair value disclosure purposes, the Company utilized certain value measurement criteria required under the ASC 820, as discussed below.

Estimated fair values have been determined by the Company using the best available data and an estimation methodology it believes to be suitable for each category of financial instruments. Changes in the assumptions or methodologies used to estimate fair values may materially affect the estimated amounts. Also, there may not be reasonable comparability between institutions due to the wide range of permitted assumptions and methodologies in the absence of active markets. This lack of uniformity gives rise to a high degree of subjectivity in estimating financial instrument fair values. 

Cash and cash equivalents, which are comprised of cash and due from banks and the Company’s balance at the Federal Reserve, had recorded values of $
570.1
 million and $
1.04
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which approximated fair values.

Investment securities have estimated fair values based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs, if available. If observable inputs are not available, fair values are determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs that are based on the best information available in the circumstances. For these investment securities, fair values are based on the present value of expected cash flows from principal and interest to maturity, or yield to call as appropriate, at the measurement date.

Commercial loans, at fair value are comprised of commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans which had been previously originated for sale or securitization in the secondary market, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. Commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based upon pricing for similar loans where market indications of the sales price of such loans are not available. SBA loans are valued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge loans are valued individually. 

Loans, net have an estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate used in these calculations is the estimated current market rate adjusted for borrower-specific credit risk. The carrying value of accrued interest approximates fair value.

For OREO, market value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 
7
% to 
10
% for estimated selling costs.

131

Federal Reserve, FHLB, and ACBB stock, are held as required by those respective institutions and are carried at cost. Each of these institutions require their members to hold stock as a condition of membership. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions, the FHLB stock requirement periodically increases or decreases with varying levels of borrowing activity.

Deposits (comprised of interest and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (generally, their carrying amounts). The fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings are equal to their carrying amounts as they are overnight borrowings. There were 
no
 short-term borrowings outstanding at 
December 31, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023.

Time deposits, when outstanding, senior debt and subordinated debentures have a fair value estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to discount expected cash flows. 
There were 
no
 time deposits outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Long-term borrowings resulted from sold loans which did not qualify for true sale accounting. They are presented in the principal amount of such loans. 

Interest rate swaps are either assets or liabilities and have a fair value which is estimated using models that use readily observable market inputs and a market standard methodology applied to the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and the applicable interest rate index.
The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the amount of unamortized deferred loan commitment fees. The fair value of letters of credit is based on the amount of unearned fees plus the estimated cost to terminate the letters of credit. Fair values of unrecognized financial instruments, including commitments to extend credit, and the fair value of letters of credit are considered immaterial. Fair value information for specific balance sheet categories is as follows.

The valuations for each of the instruments above, as of the balance sheet date, are sensitive to judgments, assumptions and uncertainties, changes in which could have a significant impact on such valuations. Weighted averages were calculated using the discount rate for each individual security or loan weighted by its par value, except for SBA loans. For SBA loans, traders’ pricing indications based on loan seasoning were weighted. For commercial loans recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are reflected in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of securities which are unrelated to credit are recorded through equity. Changes in the value of subordinated debentures are a disclosure item, without impact on the financial statements. Changes in the fair value of loans recorded at amortized cost which are unrelated to credit are also a disclosure item, without impact on the financial statements. The notes below refer to the December 31, 2024 table. 

(1)
 Commercial mortgage-backed investment security, consisting of a single bank-issued CRE security, is valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate and prepayment rate applied are based upon market observations and actual experience for comparable securities and implicitly assume market averages for defaults and loss severities. The CRE-2 security has significant credit enhancement, or protection from other subordinated tranches in the issue, which limits the valuation exposure to credit losses. Nonetheless, increases in expected default rates or loss severities on the loans underlying the issue could reduce its value. In market environments in which investors demand greater yield compensation for credit risk, the discount rate applied would ordinarily be higher and the valuation lower. Changes in loss experience could also change the interest earned on this holding in future periods and impact its fair value. As a single security, the weighted average rate shown is the actual rate applied to the CRE-2 security
. For additional information related to this security see “Note E—Loans”. 

(2) 
Commercial – SBA Loans 
are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of SBA-insured loans. Their valuation is based upon the yield derived from dealer pricing indications for guaranteed pools, adjusted for seasoning and prepayments. A limited number of broker-dealers originate the pooled securities for which the loans are purchased and as a result, prices can fluctuate based on such limited market demand, although the government guarantee has resulted in consistent historical demand. Valuations are impacted by prepayment assumptions resulting from both voluntary payoffs and defaults. Such assumptions for these seasoned loans are based on a seasoning vector for constant prepayment rates from 
3
% to 
30
% over life
.

(3)
 Non-SBA commercial real estate – These loans are primarily bridge loans designed to provide property owners time and funding for property improvements. They are fair valued by a third party, based upon discounting at market rates for similar loans. Discount rates used in 
applying
 discounted cash flow analysis utilize input based upon loan terms, the general level of interest rates and the quality of the credit. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit weaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be dependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate.

(4) 
For OREO, fair value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third party appraisers, reduced by 
7
% to 
10
% for estimated selling costs. Such appraisals reflect estimates of amounts realizable upon property sales based on the sale of comparable properties and other factors. Actual sales prices may vary based upon the identification of potential purchasers, changing conditions in local real estate markets and the level of interest rates required to finance purchases.

135

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, segregated by fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below (dollars in thousands).
 The non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty (and not from administrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the allowance for credit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values.

 The method of valuation approach for the loans evaluated for an allowance for credit losses on an individual loan basis and also for OREO was the market approach based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by external appraisers, reduced by 
7
% to 
10
% for estimated selling costs
.

At December 31, 2024, principal 
on collateral dependent loans, which is accounted for on the basis of the value of underlying collateral
, is shown in the above table at an estimated fair value of $
6.6

million. To arrive at that fair value, related loan principal of $
10.9
 million was reduced by specific allowances of $
4.3
 million within the ACL, as of that date, representing the deficiency between principal and estimated collateral values, which were reduced by estimated costs to sell. When the deficiency is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off by reducing the specific allowance and decreasing principal. 
At December 31, 2023, principal on loans individually evaluated for an ACL, that is accounted for on the basis of the value of underlying collateral, is shown in the above table at an estimated fair value of $
8.9

million. To arrive at that fair value, related loan principal of $
11.8
 million was reduced by specific allowances of $
2.9
 million within the ACL, as of that date, representing the deficiency between principal and estimated collateral values, which were reduced by estimated costs to sell. 
Valuation techniques consistent with the market and/or cost approach were used to measure fair value and primarily included observable inputs for the individual loans being evaluated such as recent sales of similar collateral or observable market data for operational or carrying costs. In cases where such inputs were unobservable, the loan balance is reflected 
within the Level 3 hierarchy.

Note R—Regulatory Matters 
It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only from income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that financial holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. 
Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Additionally, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s retained earnings. Moreover, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, a banking organization that fails to satisfy regulatory minimum capital conservation buffer requirements will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions.

136

In addition to these explicit limitations, federal and state regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or financial holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Moreover, capital requirements may be modified based upon regulatory rules or by regulatory discretion at any time reflecting a variety of factors including deterioration in asset quality.

Note T—Segment Financials

The Company’s operations can be classified under three segments: fintech, specialty finance (three sub-segments), and corporate. The chief operating decision maker for these segments is the Chief Executive Officer. The fintech segment includes the deposit balances and non-interest income generated by prepaid, debit and other card accessed accounts, ACH proccessing and other payments related processing. It also includes loan balances and interest and non-interest income from credit products generated through payment relationships. Specialty finance includes: (i) REBL (real estate bridge lending) comprised primarily of apartment building rehabilitation loans (ii) institutional banking comprised primarily of security-backed lines of credit, cash value insurance policy-backed lines of credit and advisor financing and (iii) commercial loans comprised primarily of SBA loans and direct lease financing. It also includes deposits generated by those business lines.  Corporate includes the Company’s investment securities, corporate overhead and expenses which have not been allocated to segments. Expenses not allocated include certain management, board oversight, administrative, legal, IT and technology infrastructure, human resouces, audit, regulatory and CRA, finance and accounting, marketing and other corporate expenses. 

In the segment reporting below, a non-GAAP subtotal is shown, captioned “Income before non-interest expense allocation”. That subtotal presents income before consideration of allocated corporate expenses which might be fixed, semi-fixed or otherwise resist changes without regard to a particular line of business. It also reflects a market-based allocation of interest expense to financing segments which utilize funding from deposits generated by the fintech segment, which earns offsetting interest income. That allocation is shown in the “Interest allocation” line item. The rate utilized for the allocation corresponds to an estimated average of the three year FHLB rate. The fintech segment interest expense line item consists of interest expense actually incurred to generate its deposits, which is the Company’s actual cost of funds. That actual cost is allocated to the corporate segment which requires funding for the Company’s investment securities portfolio. 

The more significant non-interest expense categories correspond to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and include salaries and employee benefits, data processing and software expenses that are incurred directly by those segments.  Expenses incurred by departments which provide support services to the segments also include those categories of expense and others which are allocated to segments based on estimated usage.  Those support department allocations are reflected in the “Risk, financial crimes and compliance” and “Information technology and operations” line items.  Other expenses not shown separately are monitored for purposes of expense management, but, unless atypically high, are ordinarily of lesser significance than the categories noted above.  

For the fintech segment, deposit growth and the cost thereof and non-interest income growth, are factors in the decision making process and are respectively reported in the consolidated statemens of operations.  For specialty finance, loan growth and related yields are factors in decision making.  Comparative loan balance information measuring loan growth is presented in Note-E Loans. In addition to consideration of the above profitability and growth aspects of its operations, decision making is focused on the management of current and future potential risks.  Such risks include, but are not limited to, credit, interest rate, liquidity, regulatory, and reputation.  The loan committee provides support and oversight for credit risk, while the asset liability committee provides support and oversight over pricing, duration and liquidity.  The risk committee provides further oversight over those and others including regulatory, reputation and other risks.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that 

142

evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Crowe LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report dated March 3, 2025 below.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Bancorp. Inc.
Wilmington, Delaware

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Bancorp, Inc’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements") and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion. 

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
