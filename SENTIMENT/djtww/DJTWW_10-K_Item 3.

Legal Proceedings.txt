Overview

TMTG ended 2024 with $776,783.4 of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as
                  $9,616.7 of debt (excluding lease liabilities) arising from the WCT transaction.

Truth Social

TMTG aspires to build a media and technology powerhouse to rival the liberal media consortium and promote free expression. TMTG was
                founded to fight back against the Big Tech companies-Meta (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others-that it believes have colluded to curtail debate in America and censor voices
                that contradict “woke” ideology. TMTG aims to safeguard public debate and open dialogue, and to provide a platform for all users to freely express themselves.

TMTG Sub Inc. (formerly known as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.) (“
Private TMTG
”) was
                incorporated on February 8, 2021, and launched its first product, Truth Social, which is a social media platform aiming to end Big Tech’s assault on free speech by opening up the internet and giving the American people their voices back. It
                is a public, real-time platform where any user can create content, follow other users, and engage in an open and honest global conversation without fear of being censored or cancelled due to their political viewpoints. TMTG does not
                restrict whom a user can follow, which it believes will greatly enhance the breadth and depth of available content. Additionally, users can be followed by other users without requiring a reciprocal relationship, enhancing the ability of
                TMTG users to reach a broad audience.

Truth Social was generally made available in the first quarter of 2022. TMTG prides itself on operating its platform, to the best of its
                ability, without relying on Big Tech companies. Partnering with pro-free-speech alternative technology firms, Private TMTG fully launched Truth Social for iOS in April 2022. Private TMTG debuted the Truth Social web application in May 2022,
                and the Truth Social Android App became available in the Samsung Galaxy and Google Play stores in October 2022. Private TMTG introduced direct messaging to all versions of Truth Social in 2022, released a “Groups” feature for users in May
                2023, and announced the general availability of Truth Social internationally in June 2023.

To foster a flourishing digital public forum, TMTG seeks to prevent illegal and other prohibited content from contaminating its
                platform. In accordance with Truth Social’s terms of service, illegal and prohibited content includes, but is not limited to a) sexual content or language; b) content that includes sexual activity, sexual intercourse or any type of sexual
                act; c) any content that portrays or suggest explicit sexual acts or sexually suggestive positions or poses; d) sexually suggestive (explicit or vague) statements, texts or phrases; or e) content in which sexual acts are requested or
                offered, including pornography, prostitution, sugar babies, sex trafficking or sexual fetishes. Using human moderators and an artificial intelligence vendor known as HIVE, Truth Social has developed what TMTG believes is a robust, fair, and
                viewpoint-neutral moderation system and that its moderation practices are consistent with, and indeed help facilitate, TMTG’s objective of maintaining “a public, real-time platform where any user can create content, follow other users, and
                engage in an open and honest global conversation without fear of being censored or cancelled due to their political viewpoints.”

During 2024, our capitalization was significantly enhanced through receipt of Business Combination proceeds and proceeds from the
                issuance of common stock described in detail in the section below titled, “
Standby Equity Purchase Agreement
.” As a result, we ended 2024 with $776,783.4 of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
                investments and just $9,616.7 of debt (excluding lease liabilities).

Truth+

Private TMTG conducted extensive technological due diligence and testing regarding a particular, state-of-the-art technology that
                supports video streaming and provides a “home” for cancelled content creators, and which TMTG has worked to acquire and incorporate into its product offerings and/or services as soon as practicable. On April 16, 2024, TMTG announced that,
                after nine months of testing on its Web and iOS platforms, the Company has finished the research and development phase of a new live TV streaming platform and expects to begin scaling up its own content delivery network (“
CDN
”) branded as Truth+.

63

Table of Contents

TMTG announced plans to roll out its streaming content in three phases:

•

Phase 1: Introduce Truth Social’s CDN for streaming live TV to the Truth Social app for Android, iOS, and Web.  On August 7, 2024, TMTG announced that TV streaming
                          via Truth Social had become available via all three modalities.

•

Phase 2: Release stand-alone Truth Social over-the-top streaming apps for phones, tablets, and other devices.  As of October 21, 2024, TMTG had announced that Truth+
                          streaming had been released as a standalone product on Android, iOS, and Web.

•

Phase 3: Release Truth Social streaming apps for home TV.  As of October 23, 2024, TMTG had announced that Truth+ streaming had been released on
                                Apple TV, Android TV, and Amazon Fire TV.

Truth.Fi

On January 29, 2025, TMTG announced its financial technology strategy, which will include the launch of the financial services and FinTech brand
                  Truth.Fi, including the investment of up to $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab. In addition to traditional investment vehicles, these funds may be allocated to customized separately managed accounts; customized exchange-traded
                  funds; and Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities.

Company Growth Strategy

As TMTG seeks to create a fully integrated media and technology company, it is pursuing these growth strategies:

Grow Truth Social. 
TMTG believes that growth in
                  Truth Social’s user base will drive more unique content, which in turn will drive the viral, organic promotion of content on Truth Social, thereby attracting more platform partners and advertisers. TMTG also plans to grow Truth Social
                  through the addition and refinement of user-friendly features — including the integration of video — and continued global expansion. As Truth Social attracts more users, the value proposition for advertisers increases, thereby
                  incentivizing advertisers to develop unique and compelling content for the platform.

Increase Product Offerings and Services.

                  Organically and/or in partnership with third parties, TMTG intends to continue developing additional cutting-edge products and/or services, including Truth+ and Truth.Fi, to complement the Truth Social platform and expand the Truth
                  ecosystem.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and/or Partnerships.

                  With cancel culture having swept through corporate America, businesses have faced increasing pressure to silence or disavow certain customers and/or have often taken controversial stands on political issues that alienated many consumers.
                  Concurrently, an increasing number of entrepreneurs are catering to conservatives across various industries. TMTG will continue to explore opportunities to partner, merge with and/or acquire other participants in this growing America
                  First Economy that would benefit from TMTG’s technology and branding—and that are able to function effectively if TMTG evolves into a holding company with numerous, largely autonomous subsidiaries in a variety of industries.

Such initiatives and acquisitions are subject to material changes and risks, some of which are beyond TMTG’s control. Given these
                uncertainties, TMTG believes it is premature for TMTG to predict when it will attain profitability and positive cash flows from its operations.

Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations

Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes

Private TMTG issued TMTG Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes to certain executives and consultants prior to the Closing Date.
                The principal amounts of the executive notes were as follows: $1,150.0 for Devin Nunes, our Chief Executive Officer, $4,900.0 for Phillip Juhan, our Chief Financial Officer, and $200.0 for Andrew Northwall, our former Chief Operating
                Officer, and the aggregate amount of such notes for other executives and one former director of Private TMTG was $4,650.0. Private TMTG was not required to pay any interest pursuant to such notes. Upon the closing of the Merger, such notes
                automatically converted in whole, without any further action by the holders thereof, into 1,090,000 shares of TMTG common stock. In addition, the aggregate principal amount of other consultant notes totaled $7,500.0, which converted into
                750,000 shares of TMTG common stock at Closing.

Restricted Stock Units and Shares for Services

TMTG granted 2,428,018 RSUs to executives of the Company for the year-ended December 31, 2024.  The Company recognized
                  $21,093.9 of compensation expense from the vesting of these RSUs based upon the fair value of the awards on their date of grant.  
As of December 31, 2024,
                  unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested equity grants was $61,313.1.
  In October 2024, we issued 57,230 shares of our common stock to WCT pursuant
                  to achieving operational milestones related to the opening of our data centers that were compensatory in nature, due to project management services WCT provided related to opening our data centers outside the scope of our written
                  agreement with them.  Compensation expense totaling $1,659.8 was recorded based on the fair value of the common stock when the milestones were achieved.

Inflation and the Global Supply Chain

Currently the U.S. economy is experiencing a bout of increased inflation, resulting in rising prices. The U.S. Federal
                  Reserve, as well as its counterparts in other countries, have engaged in a series of interest rate hikes in an effort to combat rising inflation. Although inflation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the
                  years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we anticipate that inflation will have an impact on our business going forward, including through a material increase in our cost of revenue and operating expenses in the coming years, if not
                  permanently. Continued or permanent rises in core costs could impact our growth negatively.

Current Economic Conditions

We are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by events with significant macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the
                COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, and actions taken to counter inflation. Supply chain constraints, labor shortages, inflation, and rising interest rates and reduced consumer confidence have caused
                advertisers in a variety of industries to be cautious in their spending and to either pause or slow their campaigns.

In order to manage our cost structure in light of the current macroeconomic environment and pending TMTG’s access to additional capital
                via the Business Combination, we sought opportunities to reduce our expense growth. Following the elimination of several positions in March 2023, we paused hiring in the second quarter of 2023. We were subsequently more selective about the
                roles that we filled, resulting in some attrition. We also reduced non-labor spend in areas such as travel, rent, consulting fees, and professional services.

The extent of the ongoing impact of these macroeconomic events on our business and on global economic activity is uncertain and may
                continue to adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in revenue, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), and net
                income (loss) per share may differ materially.

President Donald J. Trump

TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump. The value
                of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results
                of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base. President Donald J. Trump is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation. Additionally, TMTG’s business plan relies on President
                Donald J. Trump bringing his former social media followers to TMTG’s platform. In the event any of these, or other events, cause his followers to lose interest in his messages, the number of users of our platform could decline or not grow
                as we have assumed. To the extent users prefer a platform that is not associated with President Donald J. Trump, TMTG’s ability to attract users may decrease.

65

Table of Contents

Growth in User Base

We currently rely on the sale of advertising services for all of our revenue. If we experience a decline in the number of users or a
                decline in user engagement, including as a result of the loss of high-profile individuals and entities who generate content on Truth Social, advertisers may not view Truth Social as attractive for their marketing expenditures, and may
                reduce their spending with us, which would harm our business and operating results.

Truth Social is being developed as a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time and our business depends
                on continued and unimpeded access to Truth Social on the internet by our users and advertisers. We face strong competition to attract and engage users, including other social media platforms that focus on the same audience that Truth Social
                focuses on, competitors that develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance, companies which have greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases, which offer a
                variety of internet and mobile device-based products, services and content.

The growth of our user base depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the popularity, usefulness, ease of
                use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors; the amount, quality and timeliness of content generated by our users; the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or
                our competitors; the safety and security of Truth Social; and whether there is improper access to or disclosure of our users’ information, which could harm our reputation.

Prior to the Closing, Private TMTG relied primarily on bridge financing, in the form of convertible promissory notes, to build the Truth
                Social platform. TMTG intends to use the funds available as a result of the Business Combination to catalyze growth, including through strategic investments in marketing, advertising sales, and new technologies as described above, while
                continuing to prioritize feature development and user experience. Private TMTG has historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. For the reasons described below, TMTG expects to continue to incur
                operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future, as it works to expand its user base, attracting more platform partners and advertisers.

Attract, Retain and Motivate Talented Employees

Our results of operations rely on the leadership and experience of our relatively small number of key executive management personnel,
                and the loss of key personnel or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business. We have experienced management departures and may continue to experience management
                departures. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
                condition and results of operations. The loss of the services of these key employees or our executive management members could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals
                to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs.

Furthermore, although the risk is somewhat mitigated by the non-competition agreements signed by certain key employees in connection
                with the Closing of the Business Combination, if we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us,
                it could impair our business and our ability to successfully implement our business plan. Additionally, if we are unable to hire qualified replacements for our executive and other key positions in a timely fashion, our ability to execute
                our business plan would be harmed. Even if we can quickly hire qualified replacements, we could experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any such transition. We believe that our future success will depend on our
                continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. In addition, many of our key technologies and systems will be custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key engineering, product development,
                marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.

Expansion into New Geographic Markets

We plan to continue expanding our business operations by offering our products around the globe, and Truth Social is generally available
                internationally. As a result, we have entered new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products and may be subject to increased business and economic risks. We may not be able
                to monetize our products and services internationally as a result of competition, advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and digital advertising conventions, as well as differences in the way that users in
                different countries access or utilize our products and services. Differences in the competitive landscape in international markets may impact our ability to monetize our products and services. It is possible that governments of one or more
                countries may seek to censor content available on Truth Social in their country or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of Truth Social in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely.

In addition, governments in other countries may seek to restrict access to Truth Social from their country entirely if they consider us
                to be in violation of their laws. In the event that access to Truth Social is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access, our
                ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected. We may be subject to
                greater risks than typical social media platforms because of the focus of our offerings and the involvement of President Donald J. Trump. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully, our business may
                suffer.

Key Operating Metrics

From its inception through the Closing, Private TMTG focused on developing Truth Social by enhancing features and user interface rather
                than relying on traditional performance metrics like average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts, including monthly and daily active users. While many industry peers may gather and report on these or
                similar metrics, given the early development stage of the Truth Social platform, TMTG’s management team has not relied on any particular key performance metric to make business or operating decisions. TMTG believes that this evaluation is
                critical and in line with its commitment to implement a robust business plan that may involve introducing innovative features and potentially incorporating new technologies. At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering
                to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation
                with respect to the progress and growth of its business. TMTG believes that focusing on these key performance indicators might not align with the best interests of TMTG or its stockholders, as it could lead to short-term decision-making at
                the expense of long-term innovation and value creation. Therefore, TMTG believes that this strategic evaluation is critical and aligns with its commitment to a robust business plan that includes introducing innovative features and new
                technologies.

In connection with such an evaluation, and consistent with SEC guidance, TMTG will consider the relevant key performance indicators for
                its then-current business operations and determine whether it has effective controls and procedures in place to process information related to the disclosure of key performance indicators and metrics. Should this be the case, TMTG may
                decide to collect and report such metrics if they are deemed to significantly enhance investors’ understanding of TMTG’s financial condition, cash flows, and other aspects of its financial performance. However, TMTG may find it challenging
                or cost-prohibitive to implement such effective controls and procedures and may never collect, monitor, or report any or certain key operating metrics. As the platform evolves and new technologies and features are added, TMTG’s management
                team expects to reevaluate whether TMTG will gather and monitor one or more metrics and rely on such information in making management decisions. If TMTG determines to do so, TMTG expects to present such material key operating metrics
                appropriately in its periodic reports to enhance investors’ understanding of its financial condition, cash flows, and any other changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

As of the period ended December 31, 2024, all revenue has been derived from the advertising of products and services on the Truth Social
                platform. Advertising revenue is generated by displaying advertisements as posts (attributable to “Truth Ads”) in users’ Truth Social feeds.

On August 19, 2022, TMTG entered into an Advertising Publisher Agreement (“Rumble Agreement”) with Rumble USA, Inc. (“Rumble”), pursuant
                to which Rumble was engaged to sell advertising space for the placement of advertisements on Truth Social by making Truth Social Ad units (“Ad Unit” or “Ad Units”) available for advertisers on an advertising manager service maintained by
                Rumble. TMTG and Rumble executed a minimum guarantee advertising publisher agreement on October 30, 2023 (the “Minimum Guarantee Rumble Agreement”), which replaced the Rumble Agreement. While TMTG determines the number of Ad Units available
                on our Truth Social platform, the prices for the Ad Units are set by an auction operated and managed by Rumble. Under the current agreement, 70% of the total aggregate gross revenues from the sale of Ad Units are allocated to TMTG, and the
                Ad Units will comprise at least 85% of the aggregate number of paid advertisements directly into Truth Social feeds by TMTG each month. We recognize advertising revenue during the period in which we satisfy our performance obligation by
                displaying advertisements in users’ Truth Social feeds. We reimburse Rumble for the direct out-of-pocket costs incurred by Rumble in the performance of the service covered by the Rumble Agreement, including processing fees and
                chargebacks/refunds paid to advertisers in relation to an Ad Unit.

On October 3, 2022, TMTG entered into a Publisher Agreement (the “TAME Agreement”) with The Affinity Media Exchange, Inc. (“TAME”),
                pursuant to which TMTG engaged TAME as its non-exclusive agent and representative for the sale of Digital Advertising Inventory on Truth Social. “Digital Advertising Inventory” means all advertising opportunities on the Truth Social
                platform which are inserted or added to the TMTG website, app, ad stacks, or video exchange players of Truth Social. Within 25 days of the end of each calendar month, TAME is required to provide TMTG with month end sales reporting by
                platform and to pay TMTG the net revenues actually paid to TAME by the advertisers, after deducting TAME’s commissions equal to 10% of the Digital Advertising Inventory revenue actually collected on behalf of TMTG for Truth Social.

The Rumble Agreement grants to Rumble a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any and all trademarks, service marks,
                trade names, symbols, logos and other branding identifiers of TMTG and Truth Social solely for purposes of performing the services covered by the Rumble Agreement, provided, however, that such license does not include permission to alter,
                modify, edit, denigrate, or distort Donald J. Trump’s name, photograph, likeness (including caricature), voice, and biographical information, or any reproduction or simulation thereof.

For a description of TMTG’s revenue recognition policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in
                  TMTG’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 included in this Annual Report.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue primarily encompasses expenses associated with generating advertising revenue, direct costs associated with the
                acquisition and licensing of content, and streaming delivery costs of our CDN, excluding depreciation and amortization expense.

TMTG expects cost of revenue to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as it expands its Truth Social and Truth+ platforms.
                Such increases will likely include investment in infrastructure and other direct costs such as revenue share expenses, allocated facility costs, and traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”).

Infrastructure costs allocated may include data center costs related to TMTG’s co-located facilities, lease and hosting costs, related
                support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs, public cloud hosting costs; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams.

TAC costs may include costs TMTG incurs with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of its advertising products that
                it places on third-party publishers’ websites and applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions.

General and Administration Expenses

General and administration expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based
                compensation for TMTG’s executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administration employees. In addition, general and administration expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including
                consulting, third-party legal and accounting services and facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.

We also expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with
                rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation,
                for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market
                research, trade shows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based
                compensation, for TMTG’s engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of its products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include allocated facilities costs and other supporting overhead
                costs.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation of computer software and computer equipment. Amortization expense consists of
                amortization of intangible assets.

Non-Operating Income and Other Items

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities

TMTG determined the automatic discounted share-settlement feature of its convertible promissory notes was an embedded derivative
                requiring bifurcation accounting as (1) the feature was not clearly and closely related to the debt host and (2) the feature met the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging).

The bifurcated embedded features of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes were initially recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value
                on the date of issuance. After the initial recognition, the fair value of the embedded derivative feature changed over time due to changes in market conditions. The change in fair market value has been included in the statement of
                operations through the date the debt was converted.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists of accreted interest expense on Private TMTG’s outstanding convertible promissory note obligations and assumed
                debt from the WCT acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs, other related financing expenses and the post-merger interest expense related to DWAC’s Note Purchase Agreements. The convertible promissory notes (net of any related
                debt issuance costs) accreted interest using the respective effective interest rate method until the debt was extinguished.

Interest Income

Interest income consists of interest earned from banking institutions and through repurchase agreements.

Income Tax Expense

TMTG is subject to income taxes in the United States. The Company maintains a net operating loss (“NOL”) position but has not recognized
                a benefit in future years. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A
                valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. TMTG has established a full valuation allowance to offset its U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of
                realizing future tax benefits from our NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The utilization of the net operating losses prior to the Merger may be limited as per IRC Section 382.

Results of Operations

The results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with TMTG’s consolidated financial statements as of and for

Revenues

Revenues decreased $512.3, or 12%, to $3,618.8 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to revenue of $4,131.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023. A
                significant portion of the decrease was attributable to a change in a revenue share agreement with one of our advertising partners, which was intended to improve our short-term, pre-Merger financial position. Additionally, revenue has
                varied as we selectively test a nascent advertising initiative on our Truth Social platform.

Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue increased $454.1, or 275%, to $619.0 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $164.9 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
                increase was primarily due to content license and data center lease costs that support our burgeoning Truth+ platform.

Research and development expense

Research and development expense increased $39,388.6 or 405%, to $49,104.3 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $9,715.7 for the year ended
                  December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by $30,142.5 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2024 related to the issuance of convertible notes to certain vendors engaged in the
                  development of our live TV streaming platform, Truth+.  In addition, we experienced higher year-over-year consulting, salary, software, and server costs related to the implementation of Truth+.

Sales and marketing expense

Sales and marketing expense increased by $5,104.1, or 399%, to $6,383.7 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1,279.6 for the year ended December
                31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $4,064.6 increase in marketing expense following access to additional capital and a $600.0 bonus paid to an entity owned by a former director of and consultant to Private TMTG, as further
                described herein.

General and administration expense

General and administration expense increased by $121,738.1, or 1,371%, to $130,616.8 for the year ended December 31, 2024
                  compared to $8,878.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to merger related costs, including $80,661.9 of cash and non-cash stock-based awards to employees and vendors recorded throughout 2024 in connection
                  with mergers and acquisitions completed during the year.  Additionally, we experienced higher legal, insurance, software license, accounting, finance, and other merger-related costs.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2,874.3, or 4,823%, to $2,933.9 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $59.6 for the year ended
                December 31, 2023.  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the acquisition of software and hardware utilized to place our CDN into service as part of our launch of streaming video through Truth+.

Interest income

Interest income increased to $14,722.2 or 100%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $0.0 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was
                due to interest earned in 2024 on cash holdings in a money market account and interest earned through repurchase agreements secured by U.S. treasury securities.

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased by $36,339.3, or 92%, to $3,089.8 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $39,429.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023.
                The decrease was primarily due to the conversion of Private TMTG Convertible Notes to common stock, thus no longer accruing or accreting interest as compared for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Change in the fair value of derivative liabilities

The loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes increased by $223,124.4, or 7,993%, to
                $225,916.0 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $2,791.6 for the year ended December 31, 2023. All Private TMTG Convertible Notes were automatically converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to Closing of the
                Merger, and pursuant to ASC 815, the derivative liabilities were revalued immediately prior to the conversion of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes on March 25, 2024, when our closing share price was $49.95 per share. The substantial
                increase in the value of our common stock when combined with the certainty of our execution of the Merger were primarily responsible for the increase in the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities. The increase in the fair value
                of the derivative liabilities is a non-cash expense and the issuance of Private TMTG common stock upon conversion of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes extinguished the derivative liabilities immediately prior to the Closing. Therefore,
                there was no derivative liability recorded as of December 31, 2024, and there will no longer be future earnings adjustments pertaining to the Private TMTG Convertible Notes derivative liabilities.

Revenues

Revenues increased by $2,660.6, or 181%, to $4,131.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to revenue of $1,470.5 for the year ended December 31,
                2022. The increase was primarily the result of enhanced early-stage testing of a nascent advertising initiative on our Truth Social platform.

Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue increased by $110.4, or 203%, to $164.9 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $54.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
                increase was due to an increase in personnel-related expenses, which primarily reflects the allocation of a portion of salary expense for three of our employees who contributed to the early-stage testing of Truth Social’s nascent
                advertising initiative.

Table of Contents

Research and development expense

Research and development expense decreased by $3,917.4, or 29%, to $9,715.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $13,633.1 for the year ended
                December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to significantly lower IT-related third-party consulting fees, server costs, and computer software costs.

Sales and marketing expense

Sales and marketing expense increased by $653.7, or 104%, to $1,279.6 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $625.9 for the year ended December 31,
                2022. The increase was driven by a $859.8 increase in marketing expense, offset by a $206.2 decrease in marketing consultant costs.

General and administration expense

General and administrative expense decreased by $1,466.9, or 14%, to $8,878.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $10,345.6 for the year ended
                December 31, 2022, driven by a $1,358.4 aggregate decrease in rent, travel and entertainment expenses, staffing-related costs, and office supplies.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense was effectively unchanged at $59.6 for year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $58.7 for the year ended December 31,
                2022.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased by $37,390.4, or 1,834%, to $39,429.1 for year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2,038.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
                The increase was primarily due to the accreted interest (which adds to the balance) related to TMTG’s convertible promissory notes recorded as of December 31, 2023.

Change in the fair value of derivative liabilities

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the fair value of the derivative liability component of the TMTG Convertible Notes increased 23% to $18,402.9 from
                $14,905.3 on December 31, 2022. The higher value was primarily driven by a 17% increase in the underlying price of Digital World’s stock during the measurement period (from $15.00 at year-end 2022 to $17.50 at year-end 2023). As a result,
                TMTG reported a related non-cash expense of $2,791.6 for the full year 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the fair value of the derivative liability component of the TMTG Convertible Notes decreased substantially. The lower
                value was primarily driven by a steep decline in the underlying price of Digital World’s stock during the measurement period. The underlying stock price decreased 71% for the year ended December 31, 2022 (from $51.43 to $15.00). As a
                result, TMTG reported related non-cash income of $75,809.9 for the full year 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Historically, as a private company, we financed operations primarily through cash proceeds from the issuance of Private TMTG Convertible Notes. During 2024,
                our capitalization was significantly enhanced through receipt of Business Combination proceeds and proceeds from the issuance of common stock described in detail in the section below titled, “Standby Equity Purchase Agreement.”  As a
                result, we ended 2024 with $776,783.4 of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and just $9,616.7 of debt (excluding lease liabilities).  Cash and cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposits held at financial
                institutions. Cash deposits are held at major financial institutions and are subject to credit risk to the extent those balances exceed applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limitations. Short-term investments consist of a
                repurchase agreement in which we loan our cash over 1 to 3 days to a seller in exchange for interest earned on debt securities collateralizing the loan.  The seller retains a beneficial interest in the securities serving as collateral.

Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital and to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We
                currently seek to (1) grow our initial product, Truth Social; (2) increase its product offerings and services, including through further development of its streaming technology platform, Truth+; and (3) pursue strategic acquisitions and/or
                partnerships. We intend to fund these activities through a combination of deploying cash on hand, generating advertising, subscription, and fee-based revenues, issuing equity, and/or selling stock pursuant to that certain Standby Equity
                Purchase Agreement dated July 3, 2024.

75

Table of Contents

Although we anticipate that the current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we cannot guarantee that we will
                not be required to obtain additional financing, or that additional financing, if needed, will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, although there are no other present binding understandings, commitments, or
                agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses, products, or technologies, we will, from time to time, evaluate acquisitions of other businesses, products, and technologies. If we are unable to raise additional equity or
                debt financing, as and when needed, we could be forced to forego such acquisitions or significantly curtail our operations.

                ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by $52,717.5 of higher cash expenses (including higher general and administration, research and development, and marketing expenses).

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $618,581.1 compared to $2.2 used in investing activities during the year ended
                December 31, 2023. The substantial increase was due to the following: $606,547.3 of cash outflows to short-term investments, a $7,000.0 cash payment related to the acquisition of WorldConnect Technologies, and $5,033.8 of cash disbursements
                primarily related to placing our data centers into service.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $9,733.5 compared to $24,201.5 used in operating activities during the period
                ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was driven by a $7,279.9 lower operating loss in 2023 compared to 2022. The lower operating loss resulted from $2,660.6 of higher revenue and $4,729.7 of lower
                operating expenses (driven primarily by lower IT-related third-party consulting fees, server costs, computer software costs, rent, travel and entertainment expenses, and staffing-related costs).

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2, a decrease of $82.3 from cash used in investing activities of $84.5 for
                the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of furniture, fixtures, and equipment in 2023 compared to 2022.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $2,500.0 compared to $15,360.0 provided by financing activities for the
                year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a lower dollar amount of issuance of the TMTG Convertible Notes in 2023 compared to 2022.

Private TMTG Convertible Notes

Notes 1 to 7 were issued from May 2021 through October 2021 with a cumulative face value of $5,340.0 (including $240.0 of debt issuance costs), maturity of
                24 months from each respective issuance date and interest was accrued at 5% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Each of Notes 1 to 7 contemplated multiple plausible outcomes that include conversion upon a
                Qualified SPAC Business Combination (“SPAC”) and at least one of the following conversion triggers: Qualified Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), private equity transaction and/or change of control. All outstanding principal of these Notes,
                together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the lender upon conversion of the Notes in the event of a completed SPAC transaction would be
                the number of shares of the Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding, divided by $4.00. In other, non-SPAC conversion scenarios, the
                number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes was variable based on the application of an automatic discounted share-settlement feature. For Notes 1 and 2, the number of shares of Company stock to
                be issued to the Lender upon a non-SPAC conversion event would be the number of shares of Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b)
                divided by 40% of the initial public offering price per share of a qualified initial public offering. For Notes 3 to 7, the number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon a non-SPAC conversion event would be the number of
                shares of Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by 40% of (i) the initial public offering price per share of a
                qualified initial public offering, (ii) the price per share as determined by the valuation of the  Company in connection with a qualified private equity raise, or (iii) in the case of a change of control, the price per share determined in
                accordance with the Company’s then current fair value determined by an independent valuation firm.

Notes 8 to 12 were issued from November 2021 through December 2021 with a cumulative face value of $17,500.0, maturity of between 18 months and 36 months and
                interest was accrued at a range between 5%  and 10% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Notes  8 to 12 were convertible simultaneously with the completion of a  SPAC merger agreement or IPO. All outstanding
                principal of these Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes would be the number of shares
                of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by either US$25, US$21 or US$20 subject to the respective conditions of
                the individual Notes; provided, however, in the event that the stock price quoted for the Company on NASDAQ or The New York Stock Exchange (as applicable) at the time of the closing of the Qualified SPAC Business Combination (the “TMTG
                Stock Price”) is less than either $50 per share, $42 per share, $40 per share subject to the respective conditions of the individual Notes, then the Conversion Price would be reset to 50% of the then current TMTG Stock Price subject to a
                floor of $10 per share.

Notes 13 to 18 were issued from January 2022 through March 2022.  Note 19 was issued on August 23, 2023.  Notes 13 to 19 were Convertible Promissory Notes
                issued with a cumulative face value of  $17,360.0 (net of repayments), maturity of 18 months and interest will be accrued at a range between 5%  and 10% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Notes 13 to 19 were
                convertible simultaneously with the completion of a SPAC merger agreement or IPO. All outstanding principal of these Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of
                Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes would be the number of shares of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes
                then outstanding (b) divided by either US$25 or US$21 subject to the respective conditions of the individual notes.

Notes 20 to 23 were issued from November 2023 through March 2024 with a cumulative face value of  $7,955.0, maturity of 18 months and interest will be
                accrued at 10% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Notes 20 to 23 were convertible with the completion of a SPAC merger agreement IPO. The outstanding principal of the Notes, accrued but unpaid interest on
                such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes in the event of a SPAC transaction would be the number of shares of the Company stock (rounded to the
                nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by US$10.  The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes in the
                event of an IPO would be the number of shares of the Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by 50% of the IPO price per
                share.

Several of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes were amended, extended, and/or restated after their initial issuance and prior to their conversion.

Each Private TMTG Convertible Note that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing automatically converted immediately prior to the
                effective time of the Closing into a number of shares of Private TMTG common stock as such Private TMTG Convertible Note would automatically have been converted into upon the Closing, in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

Additionally, pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into by and between Digital World and certain institutional investors on February 8, 2024 (the
                “Note Purchase Agreements”), Digital World issued $50,000.0 in convertible promissory notes (the “DWAC Convertible Notes”). The DWAC Convertible Notes: (a) accrued interest at an annual rate of 8.00% and are payable on the earlier of (i)
                the date that is 12 months after the date on which the Digital World consummated the Business Combination, which interest is not payable to the extent the holder exercises the conversion right and (ii) the date that the winding up of
                Digital World was effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”); (b) were convertible (i) at any time following the consummation of the Business Combination, but prior to the Maturity Date, redemption or otherwise the repayment in full of the
                DWAC Convertible Notes, at each holder’s option, in whole or in part, and subject to the terms and conditions of the DWAC Convertible Notes, including any required shareholders’ approval upon the consummation of the Business Combination and
                (ii) into that number of shares of common stock of the Company and warrants included in the units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock of the Company and one-half of one warrant of the Company (the “Conversion Units”),
                equivalent to (A) the portion of the principal amount of the applicable DWAC Convertible Note (excluding any accrued interest, which shall not be payable with respect to the DWAC Convertible Note that was converted) being converted, divided
                by (B) $8.00 (the “Conversion Price”); (c) could have been redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, commencing on the date on which all common stock of the Company issuable to the holders has been registered with the SEC, by providing
                a 10-day notice of such redemption (the “Redemption Right”), which Redemption Right was contingent upon the trading price of the common stock of the Company exceeding 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 3 trading days,
                whether consecutive or not, within the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the day on which a redemption notice is issued by the Company; (d) were initially drawable for 20% of the applicable investor’s
                commitment amount and a final drawdown for the remaining 80% to occur upon the closing of the Business Combination, with the proceeds of such final drawdown deposited into a control account as indicated by the Company (the “Control
                Account”). The proceeds from such final drawdown deposited into the Control Account remained therein and could not be withdrawn by the Company until such time as (i) the Company exercised the Redemption Rights using the proceeds in the
                Control Account, (ii) any portion of the applicable DWAC Convertible Note was converted, at which time such portion shall be released from the Control Account or (iii) if prior to the conversion, a resale registration statement of the
                Company covering all common stock issued pursuant to the DWAC Convertible Notes had been declared effective by the SEC. The DWAC Convertible Notes were subject to specified events of default and had registration rights pursuant to the
                registration rights agreement entered into by the Company and the parties thereto as of September 2, 2021.  Following the effectiveness on June 18, 2024, of a resale registration statement covering all common stock issued pursuant to the
                DWAC Convertible Notes, all such notes were converted on or before June 20, 2024.  The proceeds of the final drawdown were released from the Control Account on July 1, 2024.

Standby Equity Purchase Agreement

On July 3, 2024, we entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”), pursuant to which we shall have the right, but not the obligation to sell up
                to $2,500,000.0 of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time during the term of the SEPA.

The per share subscription price is 97.25% of the Market Price during a one or three-day pricing period elected by us.  The “Market Price” is defined in the
                SEPA as the lowest daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) during the one trading day, in the case of a one-day pricing period or of the three consecutive trading days, in the case of a three-day pricing period.  There is no upper
                limit on the subscription price per share that could be paid for the shares.

During the year-ended December 31, 2024, we sold 20,330,365 shares of our common stock for prices between $14.31 and $36.98 per share, pursuant to the terms
                of the SEPA.  Proceeds of these equity sales under the  terms of the SEPA were $449,874.6 (net of $513.5 of deferred offering costs).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our
                financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
                affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it
                believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management team. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, its future
                financial statement presentation, balance sheet, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding its historical and future performance, as these
                policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of its balance sheet and results of operations
                because they require its most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates
                involve a greater degree of judgement and complexity.  Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.

Revenue Recognition
. We record revenue in accordance with ASC 606.  We
                  enter into advertising contractual arrangements with advertising manager service companies. The advertising manager service companies provide advertising services to customers that facilitate the placement of ads on our Truth Social
                  platform. We determine the number of Ad Units available on our Truth Social platform. The advertising manager service companies have sole discretion over the terms of the auction and all payments and actions associated therewith. Prices
                  for the Ad Units are set by an auction operated and managed by these third-party companies. We have the right to block specific advertisers at its sole reasonable discretion, consistent with applicable laws, rules, regulations, statutes,
                  and ordinances. We are an agent in these arrangements, and recognize revenue for our share in exchange for arranging for the specified advertising to be provided by the advertising manager service companies. The advertising revenues are
                  recognized in the period when the advertising services are provided on a net basis.

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding revenue recognition and unearned revenue.

Software Development Costs
. We expense software development costs,
                  including costs to develop software products or the software component products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility typically is reached shortly before
                  the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods present.

Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our
                services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function
                intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.

Stock Based Compensation
. We measure the cost of services received in
                  exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of the award is measured on the grant date for equity classified instruments, and liability classified awards are subject to remeasurement in
                  accordance with ASC 718. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.

Acquisitions.
 We determine whether substantially all of the fair value
                  of assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the
                  threshold is not met, further assessment is undertaken to ascertain whether the acquisition meets the definition of a business.

We include the results of operations of acquired businesses in our financial statements as of the respective dates of acquisition. Accounting for business
                acquisitions requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. The purchase price,
                including estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration when applicable, is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition
                dates, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.

Table of Contents

Equity classified contingent consideration, which relate to future earn-out payments associated with our acquisitions, are generally valued their fair value
                on the acquisition date.

We use our best estimates and assumptions to determine acquisition-date fair values. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. We
                continue to collect information and reevaluate our preliminary estimates and assumptions and record any qualifying measurement period adjustments to goodwill.

See Notes 2 and 4 to our financial statements for additional information regarding business acquisitions.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
. Goodwill and
                  indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events occur that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We perform our annual
                  impairment review of goodwill at the reporting unit level. If we determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim
                  test, an impairment loss is recognized and reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred. We perform our impairment assessment based on a quantitative analysis performed for
                  our reporting unit.

We review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount of such
                assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. Should an asset not be recoverable, an impairment loss
                is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in operating income or loss in the consolidated
                statements of operations during the period incurred.

We performed our annual impairment assessment for 2024, and concluded that no impairment of goodwill was indicated.  As of December 31, 2024, we believe such
                assets are recoverable, however, there can be no assurance these assets will not be impaired in future periods.  Any future impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations.

See Notes 2 and 5 to our financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Convertible Promissory Notes
. We issued the Private TMTG Convertible
                  Notes, which contained a range of fixed rate conversion features, whereby the outstanding principal and accrued interest would be converted into common shares at a fixed discount to the market price of the common stock at the time of
                  conversion. The Private TMTG Convertible Notes represented a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation that we must or may have settled by issuing a variable number of its equity shares.
                  The bifurcated embedded features of the convertible promissory notes were initially recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance. After the initial recognition, the fair value of the convertible promissory
                  notes (derivative feature component) may have changed over time due to changes in market conditions. The change in fair market value was included in the statement of operations. The liability component of the bifurcated convertible
                  promissory notes (net of any related debt issuance costs) accreted interest using the respective effective interest rate method until maturity.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
. We use a three-tier fair value
                  hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:

Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2. Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

81

Table of Contents

The fair value hierarch requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value. 
                The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.

Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include investments and derivative financial instruments.

We measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in stock, and certain assets acquired in a business combination, also
                at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Change in fair value of derivative
                      liabilities.
 The automatic discounted share-settlement feature of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes was an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation accounting as (1) the feature was not clearly and closely related to the debt
                    host and (2) the feature met the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging).

The bifurcated embedded features of the Private TMTG Convertible Notes were initially recorded on the balance sheet at
                    their fair value on the date of issuance. After the initial recognition, the fair value of the embedded derivative feature changed over time due to changes in market conditions. The change in fair market value has been included in the
                    statement of operations through the date the debt was converted.

Interest expense. 
Interest
                    expense consists of accreted interest expense on Private TMTG’s outstanding convertible promissory note obligations and assumed debt from the WCT acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs, other related financing expenses
                    and the post-merger interest expense related to DWAC’s Note Purchase Agreements. The convertible promissory notes (net of any related debt issuance costs) accreted interest using the respective effective interest rate method until the
                    debt was extinguished.

Income tax expense. 
We
                    are subject to income taxes in the United States. The Company maintains a net operating loss (“NOL”) position but has not recognized a benefit in future years. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
                    between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
                    not be realized. We have established a full valuation allowance to offset its U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The utilization
                    of the net operating losses prior to the Merger will be limited as per IRC Section 382.

Use of Estimates
. The preparation of financial statements in
                  accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the fair
                  value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions, the assessment of recoverability of our goodwill and long-lived assets, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
                  results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates include assumptions used in the fair value of equity instruments, the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, the estimates of fair value of derivative liabilities,
                  recoverability of goodwill and intangibles, fair value of short-term investments, useful lives of property and equipment, earn-out shares, and stock-based compensation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to TMTG’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to
                adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily interest rates, access to credit and funds to run day-to-day operations, and the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if we
                expand internationally. Failure to mitigate these risks could have a negative impact on revenue growth, gross margin, and profitability.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of demand deposits in bank accounts held at financial institutions.   Our investments through a repurchase
                agreement, which is collateralized by fixed income securities of the borrower, are subject to interest rate risks, although due to the 1 to 3 day duration of each repurchase agreement, a change in the interest rate would primarily impact
                interest earned on future repurchases.  If the change in interest rate resulted in a material increase to the value of the collateralized security, at the seller’s discretion, we may be obligated to pay the seller for such an increase upon
                their repurchase of the security.

We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk
                exposure.

Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, effectively all of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained with large financial institutions. We have reviewed the
                financial statements of our banking institutions and believe it currently has sufficient assets and liquidity to conduct its operations in the ordinary course of business with little or no credit risk to us.

Financial Market Risk

The primary objective of any investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without
                significantly increased risk. Some of the securities we may invest in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we
                hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of its investment will decline. To minimize this risk in the future, we may maintain our
                portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities, including (but not limited to): commercial paper, money market funds, government and non-government debt securities and certificates of deposit.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Effective May 3, 2024, TMTG dismissed BF Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”) as its independent registered public accounting firm. On May 4, 2024, TMTG engaged Semple,
          Marchal & Cooper, LLP (“SMC”) as BF Borgers’ replacement. The decision to change independent registered public accounting firms was made with the recommendation and approval of the Audit Committee.

BF Borgers’ audit reports on TMTG’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 did not contain
          an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to audit scope or accounting principles.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the subsequent interim period, there were no disagreements, as that term is defined in Item
          304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, between TMTG and BF Borgers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to BF Borgers’ satisfaction,
          would have caused BF Borgers to make reference to such disagreements in its audit reports.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the subsequent interim period, there were no reportable events within the meaning of Item
          304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
          under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
          information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, TMTG’s Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”), to allow timely
          decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of TMTG’s management, including its Certifying Officers, TMTG carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
          the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation as of December
          31, 2024, the Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed below.

Notwithstanding the identified material weakness described below, the Certifying Officers, do not believe that this deficiency had an adverse effect on our
          reported operating results or financial condition, and has concluded that our financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report and other periodic filings present fairly, in all material respects, our financial
          condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
          operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management is
          required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
          future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
          the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
          in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material
          weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim
          financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Semple, Marchal & Cooper LLP  (PCAOB ID: 178), an
          independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

Our management identified a material weakness primarily related to our failure to design and maintain formal accounting policies, processes, and controls to
          analyze, and account for complex transactions as well as a need for additional accounting personnel who have the requisite experience in SEC reporting regulation.

This material weakness did not result in any material misstatements to our consolidated financial statements or any changes to previously filed financial
          statements.

Remediation Efforts with Respect to Material Weakness

TMTG is committed to remediating the material weaknesses described above and continuing remediation efforts in 2025. We are implementing several remediation
          measures including, but not limited to hiring additional accounting staff with the requisite background and knowledge, engaging third parties to assist in complying with the accounting and financial reporting requirements related to significant
          and complex transactions as well as adding personnel to assist with formalizing our business processes, accounting policies and internal control documentation, strengthening supervisory reviews by our management, and evaluating the effectiveness
          of our internal controls in accordance with the framework established by Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. While our efforts are ongoing, we plan to
          continue to take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses, improve our financial reporting systems, and implement new policies, procedures, and controls; however, we cannot guarantee those measures will prevent or detect material
          weaknesses in the future.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or which are reasonably
          likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.

Sarasota, Florida

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
            based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
            reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company
            after the date of management’s assessment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the 
            consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the
            related notes  (collectively referred to as “the financial statements”) and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
            effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
            over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
            regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
            plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
            financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
            as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
            reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness regarding management’s failure to design and maintain formal
            accounting policies, processes and controls has been identified and described in management’s assessment. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024
            financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 14, 2025 on those financial statements.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
            reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
            pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
            permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
            company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
            evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.

Sarasota, Florida

                      Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of
                      operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the
                      consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
                      period ended December 31, 2024
,
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
                      December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based
                      on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
                      securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
                      financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
                      respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
                      and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to
                      the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of
                      critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
                      audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of TMTG Earnout Shares

Description of the Matter

As described in Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, the fair value of TMTG Earnout Shares on
                              the date of closing of the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. was determined by the Company to be approximately $2.5 Billion. This amount was recorded as an increase to accumulated deficit and paid in capital,
                              respectively, in the same amount.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

The Company engaged a valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the TMTG Earnout Shares. This specialist utilized a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to determine the
                              fair value of the Earnout Shares at the date of the merger. Auditing the reasonableness of the Monte Carlo simulation analysis involved complex mathematical models and valuation assumptions. The primary procedure to address
                              this audit matter included retention of an additional independent valuation specialist to reperform the Monte Carlo analysis and comment on the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions. Further, we reviewed the reports of
                              the valuation experts, the methodology used for the respective valuation reports and the significant assumptions used therein. We reviewed the reports under the guidance contained in the applicable PCAOB Auditing Standards and
                              concluded that the valuations arrived at in the reports were prepared in accordance with the standards applicable to their profession, used reasonable assumptions, in light of the facts and circumstances and were not
                              materially different.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the historical accounts of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (“TMTG”), which 
changed its name from Trump Media Group Corp. in October 2021.
 The mission of TMTG is to end Big Tech’s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back. TMTG operates Truth Social, a
            social media platform established as a safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations and Truth+, a streaming platform focusing on news, Christian content, and family friendly programming.

Merger

On
                March 25, 2024, TMTG consummated the Merger Agreement dated October 20, 2021, between Digital World Acquisition Corp. (“Digital World” or “DWAC”), DWAC Merger Sub, TMTG, ARC Global Investments II (“ARC”), LLC and TMTG’s General Counsel, as
                amended on May 11, 2022, August 9, 2023 and September 29, 2023. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, upon the Closing, Merger Sub merged with and into TMTG, with TMTG surviving as a
                wholly owned subsidiary of Digital World, and with TMTG’s stockholders receiving 
87,500,000
 shares of Digital World Class A
                common stock (excluding 
40,000,000
 Earnout Shares), subject to certain adjustments and earnout provisions, in exchange for TMTG
                common stock, which is in substance, a continuation of the TMTG shareholders’ equity interests in the TMTG business, plus up to an additional 
7,854,534

                shares of New Digital World common stock to be issued upon conversion of outstanding TMTG Convertible Notes immediately prior to the Closing. 

Notwithstanding the legal form of the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination has been accounted
              for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP because TMTG is the operating company and has been determined to be the accounting acquirer under Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic
              805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), while Digital World is a blank check company. The determination is primarily based on the evaluation of the following facts and circumstances:

•

The pre-combination equity holders of Private TMTG hold the majority of voting rights in TMTG;

•

The pre-combination equity holders of Private TMTG have the right to appoint the majority of the directors on TMTG’s Board;

•

Private TMTG senior management (executives) are the senior management (executives) of TMTG; and

•

Operations of Private TMTG comprise the ongoing operations of TMTG.

Under the reverse recapitalization model, the Business Combination was treated as TMTG issuing equity for the net assets of Digital World, with no goodwill or
              intangible assets recorded.

While Digital World was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Predecessor TMTG was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial
              statements of Predecessor TMTG became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements reflect (i) the historical operating results of
              Predecessor TMTG prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Digital World and Predecessor TMTG following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Predecessor TMTG at their historical
              cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.  In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Digital World was renamed “Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.” and TMTG was renamed “TMTG Sub
              Inc.”

In accordance with the applicable guidance, the equity structure has been retroactively restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date, to reflect
              the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Predecessor TMTG common shareholders and Predecessor TMTG convertible noteholders in connection with the Business Combination. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts
              and earnings per share related to Predecessor TMTG convertible notes and Predecessor TMTG common stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business
              Combination.

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES 

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
            GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Reclassifications

We revised the presentation of our statement of operations to reclassify cost of revenue as a component of operating costs and expenses, and resulted in our gross
            profit no longer being presented within the consolidated statements of operations. We revised the presentation of the statement of operations to reflect changes in the way we manage and evaluate our business due to our launch of content
            streaming on Truth+. Reclassifications of certain prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
            assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions, the assessment of recoverability of our
            goodwill and long-lived assets, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates and assumptions reflected in the consolidated financial
            statements relate to and include, but are not limited to, the valuation of convertible promissory notes, derivative liabilities, fair value of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, recoverability of goodwill and intangibles, fair
            value of short-term investments, useful lives of intangibles and depreciable assets, earn-out shares and stock-based compensation.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
            U.S. GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents represents bank accounts and demand deposits held at financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are held at major financial
            institutions with an original maturity of 90 days or less and are subject to credit risk to the extent those balances exceed applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limitations. No losses were incurred for those balances
            exceeding the limitations.

Short-term
              investments

Our policy for short-term investments is to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal, meets liquidity needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment
              guidelines and market conditions. We utilize repurchase agreements, which are used to purchase United States Treasury Bills from a third-party seller, which are accounted for as secured borrowings under which the seller pledges its securities
              as collateral to secure a loan from us, which is equal in value to the estimated fair value of the pledged collateral. The seller retains beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral. At the maturity of the repurchase agreements, the seller
              is required to repay the loan plus accrued interest and concurrently receives back its pledged collateral from us. We may renew the agreements at the then prevailing financing rate for the same or other securities. We may be required to
              transfer additional cash in the event the fair value of the collateral pledged exceeds the loan balance. Our repurchase agreements are based the September 1996 version of the Bond Market Association Master Repurchase Agreement, which
              generally provides that the lender, as buyer, is responsible for obtaining collateral valuations from a generally recognized source agreed to by both the Company and the seller, or, in an instance when such source is not available, the value
              determination is made by the lender.

Our repurchase agreements are expected to range from 
1
 to 
3
 days in duration and the purchase price will be equal to the repurchase price, reducing our exposure to significant market fluctuations and other variables that may
              result in decline of the fair value of the securities purchased. We intend to renew our repurchase agreements immediately upon the termination of the preceding repurchase agreement to increase our potential to generate interest income. The
              repurchase agreements are reported at the unpaid balance, net of any allowance for expected losses. No expected credit losses were recorded as of December 31, 2024.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets

Other current assets consist of receivables for proceeds from warrant exercises, deferred cost associated with the issuance of our common stock, retainers for
            professional services, prepaid rent, insurance and prepaid data costs. Prepaid and deferred costs are amortized proportionally to their utilization in our operations.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
            the assets. 
Useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:

Asset Type

Range

Furniture and equipment

2
 - 
5 years

Computer equipment 

3 years

Expenditures which substantially increase value or extend useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
            incurred. Gains and losses are recorded on the disposition or retirement of property and equipment based on the net book value and any proceeds received.

Long-lived fixed assets held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
            may not be fully recoverable. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a line of service, a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of operating
            or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in TMTG climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. If such indicators are present, TMTG performs undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. The
            asset value would be deemed impaired if the undiscounted cash flows generated did not exceed the carrying value of the asset. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. There were no
            triggering events identified that necessitated an impairment test over property and equipment. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. See Note 6 - Property and equipment for
            further detail.

Software development cost

We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological
              feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility typically is reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.

Software development cost also includes costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs
              related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such
              software applications were not material for the periods presented.

Additionally, we acquired capitalized software through a business acquisition (see Note 4, Business Acquisition).

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events occur that would indicate a potential
              reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill at the reporting unit level. If we determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill or other
              indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized and reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the
              period incurred. We perform our impairment assessment based on a quantitative analysis performed for our reporting unit. 

We review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
              may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. Should an asset not be recoverable, an impairment loss is
              measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements
              of operations during the period incurred. 

As of December 31, 2024, we believe such assets are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance these assets will not be impaired in future periods. Any
              future impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

 For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $
2,236.9

              of amortization expense on our intangible assets.

Revenue recognition

We record revenue in accordance with ASC 606. We determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps- Identification of the
            contract, or contracts with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and -
            Recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations.

We entered into advertising contractual arrangements with advertising manager service companies. The advertising manager service companies provide advertising
            services through their Ad Manager Service Platform on our Truth Social website to customers. We determine the number of Ad Units available on our Truth Social website. The advertising manager service companies have sole discretion over the
            terms of the auction and all payments and actions associated therewith. Prices for the Ad Units are set by an auction operated and managed by these companies. We have the right to block specific advertisers at its sole reasonable discretion,
            consistent with applicable laws, rules, regulations, statutes, and ordinances. We are an agent in these arrangements, and recognizes revenue for our share in exchange for arranging for the specified advertising to be provided by the advertising
            manager service companies. The advertising revenues are recognized in the period when the advertising services are provided on a net basis.

Unearned revenue

Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognized for the services provided to our customers
              or annual licenses and is recognized as services are performed or ratably over the life of the license. We generally invoice customers in advance or in milestone-based installments. Unearned revenue of $
3,402.4
 was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was included in the unearned revenue balance as of December 31,
              2023. As December 31, 2024, unearned revenue is expected to be recognized during the succeeding 
12
-month period and is therefore
              presented as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets.

Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue primarily encompasses expenses associated with generating advertising revenue and direct costs associated with the acquisition and licensing of
            content, and streaming delivery cost of our content delivery network, excluding depreciation and amortization expense.

Research and development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and
            other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees
            engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, and customer service functions. In addition, sales and marketing-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, trade shows, branding, marketing,
            public relations costs, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs. We expense sales and marketing cost in the period in which they are incurred.

 Sales and marketing expenses were $
6,383.7
, $
1,279.6
 and $
625.9
 for the years
            ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

General and administration expenses

General and administration expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our executive,
            finance, legal, information technology, corporate communications, human resources, and other administration employees. In addition, general and administration expenses include fees and costs for professional services (including third-party
            consulting, legal, and accounting services), facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.

Stock-based compensation

We have granted restricted stock units (RSUs) vesting solely upon the continued service of the recipient. We recognize the accounting grant date fair value of
              the stock-based awards as compensation expense over the required service period of each award. 

Stock-based awards are accounted for using the fair value method. RSU’s are measure based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock on their
              respective accounting grant dates. We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize stock-based compensation expense over the service period of the award. We record forfeitures when they occur, based on our lack of historical data
              available to estimate an appropriate forfeiture rate. Changes in our forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense since the cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate is recognized in the
              period in which the estimate is changed. Upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a
              separate award. 

For the RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay
              in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in
              part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. 

We accounted for the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes as a liability award under ASC 718 as the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes could be
              converted into a variable number of shares upon a Change of Control event and the executives had the sole discretion to extend the Maturity Date which could result in us being required to settle the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes
              in cash. We remeasured the fair value of the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes at their settlement date and recorded stock-based compensation expense for these awards. 

We issued shares of our common stock pursuant to our acquisition of WCT for achieving operational milestones related to the opening of future data centers, which were compensatory in nature. The
                estimated allocation of shares as compensation was based upon the estimated fair value of services to be provided divided by the closing price of our common stock on the date of acquisition. Compensation expense related to these shares was
                recorded at the fair value of the common stock when the milestones were achieved during October 2024.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Income taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
            attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
            are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
            recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Income tax amounts are therefore recognized
            for all situations where the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in income tax expense in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Accrued interest expense and penalties
            related to uncertain tax positions are recorded in Income Tax Expense/(Benefit). See Note 9 - Income Taxes.

Leases

We lease office and data center space in various locations. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. We have lease agreements with
              lease and non-lease components and have elected to account for such components as a single lease component. 

We initially recognize and measure contracts containing a lease and determine lease classification at commencement. Right-of-use (ROU) assets and operating lease
              liabilities are measured based on the estimated present value of lease payment over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate when the rate implicit in the lease cannot
              be readily determined. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is based upon information available at lease commencement. The lease term includes periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain that options as well as
              periods subsequent to an option to terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain we will not exercise the termination option. 

Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs, such as
                management fees, insurance, and common area maintenance, are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. On our balance sheets, assets and liabilities associated with operating leases
                are included within right-of-use assets, net, current portion of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities.

Derivatives

We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that
                  qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair
                  value reported in the statements of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required
                  within 12 months of the balance sheet date. We accounted for the warrants and earnout in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. We have determined that the warrants qualify for equity treatment in our consolidated financial
                  statements. 

Business combinations

We include the results of operations of acquired businesses as of the respective acquisition dates. Purchase price is allocated to the tangible and
                  intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. If applicable, we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration payments in determining the purchase
                  price. Measurement period adjustments to provisional purchase price allocations are recognized in the period in which they are determined, with the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income resulting from
                  such changes calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value in subsequent periods as an increase or decrease in general and administration expenses.
                  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 

Commitments and contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a
            liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We have 
no
 liabilities recorded for loss contingencies.

Concentrations of risks

Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Although we deposit
              cash and cash equivalents with multiple banks, these deposits may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may generally be redeemed upon demand and bear minimal risk. 

One customer accounted for 
94.0
%, 
88.5
% and 
77.0
% of our total
              revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

In order to reduce the risk of downtime of the products we provide, we have established data centers in various
                geographic regions. We have internal procedures to restore products in the event of a service disruption or disaster at any of our data center facilities. We serve our customers and users from data center facilities operated either by us or
                third parties. Even with these procedures for disaster recovery in place, the availability of our products could be significantly interrupted during the implementation of restoration procedures.

Recently issued accounting standards

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” or ASU 2023-09.
            ASU 2023-09 requires additional disaggregated disclosures on an entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation and additional details on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective on a prospective basis, with the option for retrospective
            application, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ASU 2024-03 is effective
            prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting period after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim
            reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance will result in additional disclosures, but we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will impact our consolidated financial position,
            results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, Debt (Subtopic 470-20): Debt with Conversion and Other Options. ASU 2024-04 clarifies the assessment of whether a
            transaction should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt when changes are made to conversion features as part of an offer to settle the instrument. ASU 2024-04 is effective for reporting periods
            beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for entities that have adopted ASU 2020-06. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-04 to have a material impact on our
            consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own
            Equity (Subtopic 815-40)—Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible
            instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion
            features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s
            Own Equity, and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s
            own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as
            of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. We have adopted ASU 2020-06 effective as of January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” or ASU 2023-07. ASU 2023-07 enhances
            the disclosures required for reportable segments on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
            December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU 2023-07 for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2024. The additional disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 - RECAPITALIZATION

As discussed in Note 1, following the Closing of the
          Business Combination, TMTG was deemed the accounting acquirer and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization.

Transaction Proceeds

Upon the Closing, we received gross
          proceeds of $
233,017.5
. 
The following table reconciles the
          elements of the Business Combination to the Consolidated statements of cash flows and the Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) for the year ended December 31, 2024:

 in one-time direct and incremental transaction costs, consisting of legal and other professional fees, recorded in
          general and administration expenses. TMTG also issued $
6,130.0
 of bonus payments to our employees and a director of Private TMTG that
          were triggered by the Merger. We recorded $
5,530.0
 and $
600.0
 in general and administration expense and sales and marketing expense, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. TMTG deems these to be non-recurring expenses that are not direct and incremental
          to the Merger.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Public and private placement warrants

In connection with Digital World’s initial public offering
          in 2021, 
14,374,976
 public warrants were issued (the “Public Warrants”) and 
566,742
 warrants were issued in a private placement (the “Private Placement Warrants”; and the Private Placement Warrants together with the Public Warrants, collectively the
          “Warrants”) all of which warrants remained outstanding and became warrants for the Common Stock in the Company.

Additionally, pursuant to warrant subscription agreements
          (each a “Warrant Subscription Agreement”) entered into by and between Digital World and certain institutional investors on February 7, 2024, Digital World agreed to issue an aggregate of 
3,424,510
 warrants (“Convertible Note Post IPO Warrants and “Post-IPO Warrants”), each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase 
one
 share of the Company’s Class A common stock for $
11.50

          per share. The Convertible Note Post IPO Warrants and Post-IPO Warrants were issued concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, and have substantially the same terms as the public warrants issued by Digital World in connection with
          its initial public offering, except that such Post-IPO Warrants may only be transferred to the applicable holder’s affiliates.

TMTG Earnout Shares

As noted in Note 1, in connection with the Merger, TMTG
          shareholders were entitled to up to 
40,000,000
 shares if certain post-merger per share market prices were achieved.

We utilized a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to determine
          the fair value of the Earnout Shares at the date of the merger, which included the following assumptions:

The Monte Carlo simulation conclusion for each tranche of
          the Earnout Shares was the result of the average of 
1,000,000
 trial outcomes. Within each trial of the simulation:

1.

The stock price was simulated for the defined term (
1.5
 years, 
2
 years, and 
3
 years) after
                  the Merger date.

2.

The vest date was determined as the date the stock price achieved the different stock price thresholds, which were $
12.50
, $
15.00
, and $
17.50
.

3.

The payoff was calculated as the number of shares issued per tranche (
15
 million, 
15
 million, and 
10
 million)
                  multiplied by the simulated stock price at the vest date, which varied with each simulation.

4.

The payoff was discounted to the present value using the interpolated risk-free rate ranging from 
4.31
%
                  to 
4.70
%.

Volatility was calculated as the annualized standard
          deviation of daily returns from a set of Guideline Public Companies (GPC) over the expected term for each tranche. The 75th percentile of GPC volatilities was selected given our early stage life cycle relative to the GPC set. The accounting for
          the Earnout Shares was first evaluated under ASC 718 to determine if the arrangement represents a share-based payment arrangement. Because there were no service conditions nor any requirement of the participants to provide goods or services, we
          determined that the Earnout Shares were not within the scope of ASC 718.

Next, we determined that the Earnout Shares represent a
          freestanding equity-linked financial instrument to be evaluated under ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. Based upon the analysis, we concluded that the Earnout Shares should not be classified as a liability under ASC 480.

We next considered the equity classification conditions in
          ASC 815-40-25 and concluded that all of the conditions were met. Therefore, the Earnout Share arrangement was appropriately classified in equity.

As the merger has been accounted for as a reverse
          recapitalization, the fair value of the Earnout Shares arrangement has been accounted for as an equity transaction as of the closing date of the merger.

On April 26, 2024, the Earnout Shares had been earned and
          such shares were issued.

NOTE 4 – BUSINESS ACQUISITION

Acquisition of World Connect Technologies, LLC

On August 9, 2024, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of WorldConnect Technologies, LLC (“WCT”), which included the source
        code, an option agreement dated February 5, 2024, by and 
between WCT, Perception Group, Inc., Perception TVCDN Ltd., and FORA FOrum RAčunalništva, d.o.o., as amended and restated (each of the parties thereto other
          than WCT, collectively, “Perception”), as well as agreements related to the source code purchase and support and maintenance.
 We incurred $
942.6

        in non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition, which were recognized within general and administration expense. We believe the acquisition will allow us to provide ultra-fast streaming technology powered through our
        custom-designed, multi-site CDN using our own servers, routers, and software stack, created with the goal of rendering the service uncancellable by Big Tech.

We funded the acquisition in exchange for an estimated aggregate consideration of up to $
132,171.0
, consisting of:

1.

2,600,000
 newly-issued shares of our common stock, equal in value to $
68,146.0
 at our common stock’s closing price on August 9, 2024.

2.

Contingent consideration upon achieving operational milestones related to the opening of future data centers, as set forth in the Asset Acquisition Agreement, 
2,442,770
 newly-issued shares of our common stock, equal in value to $
64,025.0
 at our common stock’s closing price on August 9, 2024. Each milestone is accounted for as a separate unit of account and the common stock to be issued meets the
                      criteria for equity classification pursuant to ASC 815. As of December 31, 2024, all milestones have been achieved and shares of our common stock underlying the contingent consideration have been issued.

3.

Assumption of a $
17,500.0
 liability payable over 
three years
 to Perception for the exercise of the Source Code Purchase Agreement, with an estimated net present value on the acquisition
                        date of $
16,313.2
.  $
7,000.0

                        of the assumed liability was paid upon closing.

57,230
 newly-issued shares of our common stock were
        issued to WCT pursuant to achieving operational milestones related to the opening of future data centers, which were compensatory in nature due to project management services WCT provided relating to opening our data centers outside the scope of
        our written agreement with them. The allocation of shares as compensation was based upon the estimated fair value of services to be provided divided by the closing price of our common stock on August 9, 2024. Compensation expense related to these
        shares was recorded at the fair value of the common stock when the milestones were achieved during October 2024.

The goodwill consists largely of the expected cash flows and future growth anticipated for the Company from acquiring the assets.  The goodwill is deductible for tax
        purposes.

We valued the source code and technology by applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach. The principle behind this
        valuation method is that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the subject intangible asset after deducting contributory asset charges. Projected cash flows were
        discounted using a rate of return reflecting the relative risk of achieving the cash flows as well as the time value of money. Our valuation of exclusivity rights used the with or without method, which estimates fair value by calculating the
        difference between two discounted cash flow models; one that represents the status quo for the business enterprise with the asset in place, and another without it. The projected cash flows were then discounted using a rate of return reflecting the
        risk and uncertainty of their achievement relative to the overall business. The acquired finite-lived intangible assets have a total weighted-average amortization period of 
5.00
 years.

Pro forma financial information is not presented because the acquisition was not material to our financial statements pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X.

As of December 31, 2024, $
9,616.7
 of the assumed debt
        remained outstanding and for the year ended December 31, 2024, $
303.5
 of interest expense was accreted.

, respectively. We elected to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities arising from short-term office leases with initial terms of twelve months or less (deemed immaterial)
              on the consolidated balance sheets.

When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating
              leases, we discounted lease payments using its estimated incremental borrowing rate. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied was

NOTE 11 – 
CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND WARRANTS

Notes 1 to 7 were Convertible Promissory Notes issued from May 2021 through October 2021 with a cumulative face value of $
5,340.0
, maturity of 
24
 months from each respective issuance
            date and interest was accrued at 
5
% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Each of Notes 1-7
            contemplated multiple plausible outcomes that include conversion upon a Qualified SPAC Business Combination (“SPAC”) and at least one of the following conversion triggers: Qualified Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), private equity transaction
            and/or change of control. All outstanding principal of these Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, will convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the
            Notes in the event of a completed SPAC transaction would be the number of shares of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding, divided
            by $
4.00
. In other, non-SPAC conversion scenarios, the number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion
            of the Notes was variable based on the application of an automatic discounted share-settlement feature. For Notes 1 and 2, the number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon a non-SPAC conversion event would be the number of
            shares of Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by 
40
% of the initial public offering price per share of a qualified initial public offering. For Notes 3-7, the number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender
            upon a non-SPAC conversion event would be the number of shares of Company stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by 
40
% of (i) the initial public offering price per share of a qualified initial public offering, (ii) the price per share as determined by the
            valuation of the Company in connection with a qualified private equity raise, or (iii) in the case of a change of control, the price per share determined in accordance with the Company’s then current fair value determined by an independent
            valuation firm.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Notes 8 to 12 were Convertible Promissory Notes issued from November 2021 through December 2021 with a cumulative face value of $
17,500.0
, maturity of between 
18

            months and 
36
 months and interest was accrued at a range between 
5
% and 
10
% based on the simple interest method (365 days
            year) for each note. Notes 8 to 12 were convertible simultaneously with the completion of a SPAC merger agreement or IPO. All outstanding principal of these Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert
            to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes would be the number of shares of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus
            accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by either US$
25
, US$
21
 or US$

 subject to the respective conditions of the
            individual Notes; provided, however, in the event that the stock price quoted for the Company on NASDAQ or The New York Stock Exchange (as applicable) at the time of the closing of the Qualified SPAC Business Combination (the “TMTG Stock
            Price”) is less than either $
50
 per share, $
42
 per share, $
40
 per share subject to the respective conditions of the individual Notes, then the
            Conversion Price would be reset to

Notes 13 to 18 were Convertible Promissory Notes issued from January 2022 through March 2022. Note 19 was issued on August 23, 2023. Notes 13 to 19 were 
Convertible Promissory Notes issued 
with a cumulative face value of  $
18,360.0
, maturity of 
18
 months and
            interest will be accrued at a range between 
5
% and

% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Notes 13 to 19 were convertible simultaneously with the completion of a SPAC merger agreement or IPO. All outstanding principal of these
            Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon conversion of the Notes would be the number of shares of the Company Stock
            (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by either US$
25
 or US$

 subject to the respective conditions of the individual notes.

Notes 20 to 23 were Convertible Promissory Notes issued from November 2023 through March 2024 with a cumulative face value of  $
7,955.0
, maturity of 
18
 months and
            interest will be accrued at 
10
% based on the simple interest method (365 days year) for each note. Notes 20 to 23 were convertible
            with the completion of a SPAC merger agreement or IPO. The outstanding principal of the Notes, accrued but unpaid interest on such principal, would convert to equity. The number of shares of Company stock to be issued to the Lender upon
            conversion of the Notes 
in the event of a SPAC transaction s
hall be the
            number of shares of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by US$

Lender upon conversion of the Notes in the event of an IPO would be the number of shares of the Company Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
              quotient of: (a) the principal plus accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding (b) divided by

50
% of the IPO price per
            share.

On March 25, 2024, immediately before the Closing, Notes 1 to 23, and their accrued, but unpaid interest, automatically converted into an aggregate 
6,014,534
 shares of TMTG common stock.

Convertible notes
              and warrants - February 8, 2024 - Pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into by and between Digital World and certain institutional investors on February 8, 2024 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), Digital World agreed to issue up to $
50,000.0
 in convertible promissory notes (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes: (a) accrue interest at an annual rate of 
8.00
% and are payable on the earlier of (i) the date that is 12 months after the date on which we consummated the Business Combination, which
              interest is not payable to the extent the holder exercises the conversion right and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”); (b) are convertible (i) at any time following the consummation
              of the Business Combination, but prior to the Maturity Date, redemption or otherwise the repayment in full of the Convertible Notes, at each holder’s option, in whole or in part, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Convertible
              Notes, including any required shareholders’ approval upon the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) into that number of Digital World Class A common stock and warrants included in the units, each unit consisting of 
one
 share of Class A common stock of the Company and 
one-half

              of one warrant of the Company (the “Conversion Units”), equivalent to (A) the portion of the principal amount of the applicable Convertible Note (excluding any accrued interest, which shall not be payable with respect to the Convertible Note
              that was converted) being converted, divided by (B) $
8.00
 (the “Conversion Price”); (c) may be redeemed by Digital World, in whole
              or in part, commencing on the date on which all Digital World Class A common stock issuable to the holders has been registered with the SEC, by providing a 
10-day
 notice of such redemption (the “Redemption Right”), which Redemption Right is contingent upon the trading price of the Digital World Class A common stock exceeding 
130
% of the applicable conversion price on at least 
3

              trading days, whether consecutive or not, within the 
15
 consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the day
              on which a redemption notice is issued by Digital World; (d) are initially drawable for 
20
% of the applicable investor’s
              commitment amount and a final drawdown for the remaining 
80
% to occur upon the closing of the Business Combination, with the
              proceeds of such final drawdown to be deposited into a control account as indicated by the Company (the “Control Account”). The proceeds from such final drawdown deposited into the Control Account shall remain therein and may not be withdrawn
              by the Company until such time as (i) the Company exercises the Redemption Rights using the proceeds in the Control Account, (ii) any portion of the applicable Convertible Note has been converted, at which time such portion shall be released
              from the Control Account or (iii) if prior to the conversion, a resale registration statement of the Company covering all common stock issued pursuant to the Convertible Note has been declared effective by the Commission;  (e) are subject to
              specified events of default; and (f) have registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into by the Company and the parties thereto as of September 2, 2021.

In addition,
                pursuant to warrant subscription agreements (each a “Warrant Subscription Agreement”) entered into by and between Digital World and certain institutional investors on February 7, 2024, Digital World has agreed to issue an aggregate of 
3,424,510
 warrants (“Convertible Note Post IPO Warrants and “Post-IPO Warrants”), each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase 
one
 share of the Company’s Class A common stock for $
11.50
 per share. The Convertible Note Post IPO Warrants and Post-IPO Warrants were issued concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, and have substantially the same
                terms as the public warrants issued by Digital World in connection with its initial public offering, except that such Post-IPO Warrants may only be transferred to the applicable holder’s affiliates.

Investors funded
              $
10,000.0
 of the $
50,000.0

              available under the Note Purchase Agreement before the closing of the merger and $
40,000.0
 immediately after Closing. The $
40,000.0
 of proceeds was held in a restricted account and was released upon the registration of the underlying shares on June 18, 2024. On June 18
              and 20, the face value of the Note Purchase Agreement was converted into 
6,250,000
 shares of TMTG common stock and warrants to
              purchase up to 
3,125,000
 shares of TMTG common stock.

Conversion into Paid in Capital

At the closing
                of the merger, certain Digital World and TMTG convertible notes were converted into common stock of the Company. The carrying value of the Digital World notes converted was $
8,228.6
 and the carrying value of the TMTG notes converted was $
300,426.0
,
                including the derivative liability.

We determined
                the automatic discounted share-settlement feature upon certain events (e.g., SPAC, IPO, change in control, etc.) is an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation accounting as (1) the feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt
                host and (2) the feature meets the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 (Derivative and Hedging). Subsequent changes to the fair value of the embedded derivative flows through the

Statements of Operations
.
 The Debt (net of initial debt discount and any related debt issuance costs recorded) is
                accreted using the effective interest rate method under ASC 835 (Interest) until maturity. 
The Convertible Promissory Notes (debt host) are not subject to Subtopic 480-10.

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction
            between market participants. We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:

Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2. Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

The fair value of the repurchase agreement is classified within Level 1, because we use quoted market prices of the
              counter-party collateral to determine their fair value.  Our repurchase agreement exposes us to credit risk and is collateralized by U.S. Treasury Bills.  We have not experienced any material losses related to these securities.

              The estimated fair value of the conversion feature of the derivative liability is based on traditional valuation methods including Black-Scholes option pricing models and Monte Carlo simulations. The derivative liability component of
              convertible promissory notes are classified as Level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs.

NOTE 13 –
          LOSS PER SHARE 

 Basic loss per share is
          calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of stock outstanding during the period.   We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of stock outstanding plus
          potentially dilutive shares of stock outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive shares of stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, convertible
          notes and warrants.  There were 
no
 dilutive potential common shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 because we
          incurred a net loss and the potential dilutive shares are anti-dilutive.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported net income.  Potentially dilutive shares from convertible notes were excluded as the instruments were contingently
          convertible upon an IPO or merger and are excluded from earning per share until such contingency is resolved. As such, basic and diluted earnings/loss per common share are the same.

Total
          common stock equivalents excluded from dilutive earnings/loss per share are as follows:

Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes

In March 2024, we issued unsecured Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes to certain executives, including each of our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) and one
        consultant of Private TMTG in an aggregate amount of $
10,900.0
, as consideration for their service to us through the Merger. The
        Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes bore a 
zero
-coupon interest rate, and became payable at the earlier of 
December 31, 2024
, an Event of Default, or upon a Change in Control Event.  The Maturity Date of the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes could
        be extended at the sole discretion of each executive individually for any reason, including for the purpose of allowing the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes to convert to stock or other securities upon a Change of Control Event.

Upon a Change of Control Event, the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes automatically converted into either (a) shares of common stock at a fixed conversion
        price of $
10.00
 per share upon consummating a merger with DWAC, or (b) a share amount equal to the quotient of the principal amount
        divided by the price per share based upon the current fair value of the common stock of TMTG, for any other Change of Control Events.

On March 25, 2024, we consummated a merger between DWAC and TMTG at which time the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes automatically converted into an
        aggregate of 
1,090,000
 shares of our common stock.  We accounted for the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes as a liability
        award under ASC 718 as the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes could be converted into a variable number of shares upon a Change of Control event and the executives had the sole discretion to extend the Maturity Date which could result in
        us being required to settle the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes in cash.  We remeasured the fair value of the Executive & Consultant Promissory Notes at their settlement date and recorded stock-based compensation expense for these
        awards, within general and administration expense in the Statement of Operations, totaling $
54,445.5
 for the year ended December 31,
        2024.

Vendor Convertible Notes

In March 2024, we issued unsecured convertible notes to certain vendors in exchange for research and development services provided.  These Vendor Convertible Notes
        were issued with an aggregate face value of $
7,500.0
, bore a 
zero
-coupon interest rate, and had a maturity date in 
March 2027
.

The Vendor Convertible Notes were automatically convertible in to shares of our common stock upon consummating a merger between DWAC and TMTG at a conversion price of
        $
10.00
 per share.  We measured the fair value of these Vendor Convertible Notes on their date of grant and recorded $
30,142.5
 of stock-based compensation expense, within research and development expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
        2024.

2,600,000
 newly-issued shares of our common stock issued to WCT pursuant to achieving operational milestones related to the
          opening of our data centers as compensatory in nature, due to project management services WCT provided related to opening our data centers outside the scope of our written agreement with them.  The allocation of shares as compensation was based
          upon the estimated fair value of services to be provided divided by the closing price of our common stock on August 9, 2024.  Compensation expense related to these shares were recorded at the fair value of the common stock when the milestones
          were achieved in October 2024.

NOTE 16 -
              COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time-to-time, we are a party to
              litigation and subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings and consent decrees in the ordinary course of business, and other unasserted claims.  We investigate claims as they arise and accrue
              estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Based on current known facts and circumstances, we currently believe that any liabilities ultimately resulting from ordinary course
              claims, and proceedings will not individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  However, the outcomes of claims legal proceedings or investigations are inherently
              unpredictable and subject to uncertainty, and may have an adverse effect on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors that are not known to us or cannot be quantified at this time.  We may also receive
              unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.  The final outcome of any current or future claims or lawsuits could adversely affect our
              business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  We periodically evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has previously been accrued or the reasonably possible losses that
              we have disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Consistent with the practice of many
              companies, we have entered into, and continue to enter into indemnity agreements with our executive officers and certain members of our board of directors. These indemnity agreements broadly provide for us to advance expenses (including
              attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any legal proceeding, as well as indemnification for any and all expenses, actually and reasonably incurred, in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such a
              proceeding, in connection with matters related to their position. These indemnity agreements provide that the indemnitee shall repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from where there is
              no further right of appeal that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.

Except as indicated below, to the
              knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, or against any of our property.

Litigation with United Atlantic
              Ventures (“UAV”) in Delaware

On July 30, 2021, an attorney for the
              Trump Organization, on behalf of President Trump, declared void ab initio a services agreement that had granted Private TMTG, among other things, extensive intellectual property and digital media rights related to President Trump for purposes
              of commercializing the various Private TMTG initiatives (the “Services Agreement”). Neither Private TMTG nor Digital World was a party to such agreement. On each of January 18, 2024 and February 9, 2024, Digital World received letters from
              counsel to UAV, a party to the Services Agreement. The letters contained certain assertions and enclosed a copy of the Services Agreement that had been declared void two and a half years earlier. Specifically, counsel for UAV claims that the
              Services Agreement grants UAV rights to (1) appoint two directors to TMTG and its successors (i.e., TMTG after the Business Combination), (2) approve or disapprove of the creation of additional TMTG shares or share classes and anti-dilution
              protection for future issuances, and (3) a $
1.0
 million expense reimbursement claim. In addition, UAV asserts that the Services
              Agreement is not void ab initio and claims that certain events following the July 30, 2021 notification support its assertion that such Services Agreement was not void. On February 6, 2024, a representative of UAV sent a text message to a
              representative of a noteholder of TMTG suggesting that UAV might seek to enjoin the Business Combination. On February 9, 2024, Private TMTG received from counsel to UAV a letter similar to those letters received by Digital World, which also
              threatened Private TMTG with legal action regarding UAV’s alleged rights in Private TMTG, including, if necessary, an action to enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.

On February 28, 2024, UAV filed a
              verified complaint against Private TMTG in the Chancery Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the authorization, issuance, and ownership of stock in Private TMTG and filed a motion for expedited proceedings (C.A. No.
              2024-0184-MTZ). On March 4, 2024, UAV filed an amended complaint, converting their action from a direct action to a purported derivative action, and adding members of the Private TMTG board as defendants. On March 9, 2024, the Chancery Court
              held a hearing to decide UAV’s motion to expedite proceedings. During the oral argument, Private TMTG agreed that any additional shares of Private TMTG issued prior to or upon the consummation of the Business Combination would be placed in
              escrow pending a resolution of the dispute between the parties. The Chancery Court entered an order consistent with the foregoing on March 15, 2024, and scheduled a status conference for April 1, 2024. On April 2, 2024, UAV filed a motion for
              leave to file a second amended complaint together with a motion for preliminary injunction and a motion for contempt and anti-suit injunction related to Private TMTG’s filing of a separate litigation against UAV and others in Florida state
              court. Private TMTG maintains that the contempt claims are meritless. On April 9, 2024, the Chancery Court granted the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and re-assigned the case to a new judge. On April 11, 2024, UAV filed
              its second amended complaint, naming the prior Defendants together with five new defendants—TMTG and the current directors on the TMTG Board who were not on Private TMTG’s board of directors. On April 22, 2024, all of the Defendants moved to
              vacate the Chancery Court’s prior order expediting the matter. Additionally, all of the Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. Following briefing and oral argument on the motion to vacate, on April 30, 2024, the Chancery
              Court vacated the prior provisions of the March 15 order expediting the matter. On May 6, 2024, UAV filed its Renewed Motion for Contempt of the March 15, 2024 Order against Private TMTG (“First Contempt Motion”) seeking, among other things,
              to enjoin Private TMTG and related parties from prosecuting certain claims in Florida state court. On May 8, 2024, the Chancery Court stayed discovery and granted a protective order with respect to all discovery served on Defendants and all
              other persons from whom discovery was being sought.

On June 5, 2024, UAV filed for leave
              to again amend its complaint. The Chancery Court granted the motion for leave to amend on July 8, 2024, and UAV filed its Third Amended Complaint on July 9, 2024. The Third Amended Complaint dismissed as defendants three current TMTG
              directors (W. Kyle Green, Linda McMahon, and Robert Lighthizer) and added four former Digital World directors (Frank J. Andrews, Patrick F. Orlando, Edward J. Preble, and Jeffrey A. Smith). On July 17, 2024, UAV filed a second contempt motion
              against Private TMTG and TMTG (“Second Contempt Motion”) alleging additional violations of the March 15 Order. On August 27, 2024, the Chancery Court denied both the First Contempt Motion and the Second Contempt Motion. On July 23, 2024, all
              of the defendants with the exception of Patrick F. Orlando moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. On September 17, 2024, Mr. Orlando moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. On October 8, 2024, UAV voluntarily dismissed Mr.
              Orlando with prejudice. The remaining defendants’ motions to dismiss are fully briefed, and remain pending subject to ongoing briefing of defendants’ motion to dismiss or stay on the basis of temporary Presidential immunity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Lawsuit against ARC, Patrick Orlando,
              UAV, Andrew Litinsky, and Wesley Moss in Florida

On February 26, 2024, representatives
              of ARC Global Investments II, LLC (“ARC”) claimed to Digital World that after a “more comprehensive” review, the conversion ratio for Digital World Class B common stock into Digital World Class A common stock upon the completion of the
              Business Combination was approximately 
1.8
:1. ARC’s new claim also contradicted the previous assertion by Patrick Orlando, the
              managing member of ARC, that the conversion ratio was 
1.68
:1. Digital World’s board of directors viewed these claims as an attempt
              by Mr. Orlando to secure personal benefits, breaching his fiduciary duty to Digital World and its shareholders. Digital World and Private TMTG initiated a lawsuit against ARC in the Civil Division for the Twelfth Judicial Circuit Court in
              Sarasota County, Florida, on February 27, 2024 (Docket No. 2024-CA-001061-NC). The complaint sought a declaratory judgment affirming the appropriate conversion ratio as 
1.34
:1, as previously disclosed, damages for tortious interference with the contractual and business relationship between Private TMTG and Digital World, and damages for
              conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to interfere with the same. The complaint also sought damages for Mr. Orlando’s breach of fiduciary duty, which exposed Digital World to regulatory liability and resulted in an $
18
 million penalty, and for his continuous obstruction of Digital World’s merger with Private TMTG to extort various concessions that benefited
              only him and harmed Digital World and its shareholders. Furthermore, the complaint sought damages for the wrongful assertion of dominion over Digital World’s assets inconsistent with Digital World’s possessory rights over those assets. On
              March 8, 2024, Digital World voluntarily dismissed its declaratory judgment claim against ARC. On March 17, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed an amended complaint, adding a claim for violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade
              Practices Act. Digital World further alleged breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, breach of fiduciary duty of care, and conversion claims against Mr. Orlando. With respect to ARC, Digital World alleged aiding and abetting a breach of
              fiduciary duty. On April 3, 2024, Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the proceeding pending the Delaware Action (C.A. No. 2024-0184-MTZ). Defendants ARC and Mr.
              Orlando also filed that same day a motion to stay discovery in the action.

On May 29, 2024, Digital World moved
              to compel discovery from ARC and Mr. Orlando. On July 15, 2024, following a July 10 hearing, the Court entered an order denying the motion to stay discovery and motion to compel. On July 29, 2024, the Court entered an order denying the motion
              to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the proceeding for improper venue. Defendants ARC and Orlando appealed that order, which is scheduled for oral argument on March 19, 2025. On August 2, 2024, Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando filed a
              motion to stay pending appeal in the trial court. On July 31, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which proposed to add allegations against ARC and Orlando related to pre-targeting
              and other misconduct as set forth in the SEC Complaint against Orlando, and naming UAV, Andrew Litinsky, and Wesley Moss as additional defendants. On August 15, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed a motion for temporary injunction
              seeking to enjoin the threatened sale of Digital World stock by Defendant ARC and one of the new defendants proposed to be added through the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. On August 28, 2024, Digital World and Private
              TMTG filed a renewed motion to compel, seeking prior productions to the SEC and DOJ and other documents from Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando. On August 30, 2024, the trial court held a hearing to address several motions. During the hearing,
              the Court granted Digital World and Private TMTG’s motion for leave to amend and denied their motion for temporary injunction. The trial court also denied the motion to stay pending appeal filed by Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando. On September
              3, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed the Second Amended Complaint. On September 4, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed an expedited motion to compel, seeking production of ARC’s capitalization table, supporting documents, and
              an order requiring ARC to cooperate with Digital World and Private TMTG in advance of the expiration of the lock-up restriction. On September 5, 2024, Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando filed a motion to stay pending appeal in the Second District
              Court of Appeal, which the Second District denied on October 18, 2024 (C.A. No. 2D2024-1780). On September 12, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part the expedited motion to compel, ordering production of the capitalization table
              and supporting documents by September 13, 2024, at 12 p.m. On that same day, Defendants ARC and Mr. Orlando filed a notice of removal in the Middle District of Florida (C.A. No. 8:24-cv-02161). On September 13, 2024, Digital World and Private
              TMTG filed an emergency motion to remand to state court in the Middle District of Florida, which the Middle District granted on September 17, 2024. On September 18, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed an emergency motion for temporary
              injunction and contempt against ARC and Mr. Orlando in the state court action. On that same day, the Court held a hearing during which it granted Digital World and Private TMTG’s motion for contempt, imposed a coercive sanction against ARC
              and Mr. Orlando of $
5,000
 per day until they complied with the Court’s September 12 discovery order, and denied their motion for
              temporary injunction. Defendants ARC and Orlando have appealed that order (C.A. No. 2D2024-2364).

On September 20, 2024, ARC filed its
              answer, defenses, and affirmative defenses to the Second Amended Complaint. On September 26, 2024, Defendants ARC and Orlando filed a motion to compel. On October 1, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed a motion for an order to show
              cause why ARC and Mr. Orlando should not be held in further contempt and subject to increased sanctions for their failure to comply with the Court’s September 18 contempt order. On October 3, 2024, Mr. Orlando filed an amended motion to
              dismiss the Second Amended Complaint or, alternatively, to stay the action. On October 15, 2024, ARC filed an amended answer, defenses, and affirmative defenses to the Second Amended Complaint, counterclaim, and third-party complaint, naming
              9 additional defendants: Luis Orleans-Braganza, Lee Jacobson, Bruce J. Garelick, Justin Shaner, Eric Swider, Rodrigo Veloso, Ed Preble, Frank Andrews, and Jeffrey Smith. On October 21, 2024, UAV, Wesley Moss, and Andrew Litinsky jointly filed
              3 motions: a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a cause of action, motion to stay pending resolution of the Delaware Action, and motion to dismiss for improper venue. On November 1, 2024, Digital World and
              Private TMTG filed a supplemental brief in support of the October motion for order to show cause and a fee petition to recover attorneys’ fees pursuant to the September 18 contempt order.

On November 18, 2024, the Court
              granted in part the October motion for order to show cause, ordering, inter alia, the appointment of a third-party vendor to re-collect all devices and files from ARC and Orlando and run search terms and a sanction against ARC and Orlando of
              $
5,000
 per day from September 18 to November 8, 2024. Defendants ARC and Orlando have filed a motion for leave to amend their
              petition to appeal the September 18 order to include an appeal of the November 18 order (C.A. No. 2D2024-2364). On November 21, 2024, Third-Party Defendant Shaner filed a motion to dismiss ARC’s third-party complaint, which the Court denied
              on December 13, 2024. On December 6, 2024, the Court granted in part the September 26 motion to compel filed by Defendants ARC and Orlando. On December 16, 2024, Digital World and Private TMTG filed a fee petition to recover attorneys’ fees
              pursuant to the November 18 contempt order. On December 27, 2024, Defendants ARC and Orlando filed a motion for order to show cause for failure to comply with the December 6 order. On January 3, 2025, Digital World and Private TMTG and
              Third-Party Defendants Swider, Preble, Andrews, and Smith jointly filed a motion to dismiss ARC’s counterclaims and third-party complaint. On January 8, 2025, Third-Party Defendant Garelick filed a motion to dismiss ARC’s counterclaims and
              third-party complaint. On January 10, 2025, Defendants ARC and Orlando filed a motion to compel production of documents, which the Court denied for failure to confer on January 22, 2025. On January 10, 2025, Third-Party Defendant Veloso filed
              a motion to dismiss ARC’s counterclaims and third-party complaint. On January 17, 2025, Defendants ARC and Orlando filed a motion to strike, which the Court denied for failure to confer on January 22, 2025.

On January 22, 2025, the Court held a
              hearing during which it heard the motion to stay pending resolution of the Delaware Action – taking the motion under advisement and scheduled an omnibus hearing to hear outstanding motions on March 7, 2025.  At the January 22, 2025 hearing,
              the Court entered a temporary administrative stay of discovery as to Defendants Litinsky, Moss, and UAV pending its resolution of their motion to stay. On January 23, 2025, Defendants ARC and Orlando filed a motion to compel production of
              documents and a motion to strike. On that same day, Third-Party Defendant Jacobson filed a motion to dismiss ARC’s counterclaims and third-party complaint.

Litigation with ARC in Delaware

On February 29, 2024, ARC filed a
              lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (C.A. No. 2024-0186-LWW) against Digital World and its directors, alleging an impending violation of the Digital World Charter. ARC alleged that Digital World failed to commit to issue
              conversion shares to ARC that ARC claims it is owed upon the consummation of the Business Combination pursuant to the Charter. ARC claimed a conversion ratio of 
1.81
:1 and sought specific performance and damages for the alleged breach of the Charter, a declaratory judgment that the certain derivative securities of Digital World should be included in the calculation
              of the conversion ratio, a finding that the directors of Digital World breached their fiduciary duties, and a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Business Combination until Digital World “corrected” the conversion ratio. TMTG defended
              Digital World’s calculation of the conversion ratio and related rights. In addition to its complaint, ARC also filed a motion with the Chancery Court requesting that the case schedule be expedited to enable the Chancery Court to conduct an
              injunction hearing prior to the March 22, 2024, shareholder vote. On March 5, 2024, the Chancery Court denied ARC’s motion, stating that it would not conduct a merits or injunction hearing before March 22, 2024. Consequently, the Chancery
              Court also denied ARC’s request to postpone the Business Combination vote until after a merits hearing. The Chancery Court ruled that Digital World’s proposal to deposit disputed shares into an escrow account at the close of the Business
              Combination was adequate to prevent potential irreparable harm related to ARC’s share conversion. The Chancery Court also found that Digital World’s public disclosures about ARC’s claims and possible conversion scenarios at the close of the
              Business Combination further mitigated the risk of irreparable harm due to insufficient disclosure for the March 22, 2024, vote. As a result, on March 21, 2024, Digital World entered into 
two
 escrow agreements with Odyssey, as follows: (i) an escrow agreement for the benefit of ARC (the “ARC Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which DWAC deposited into escrow

3,579,480
 shares of TMTG shares of common stock (“Common Stock”), and (ii) an escrow agreement for the benefit of the Non-ARC Class
              B Shareholders (the “Non-ARC Class B Shareholders Escrow Agreement,” and together with the ARC Escrow Agreement, the “Disputed Shares Escrow Agreements”), pursuant to which TMTG deposited into escrow 
1,087,553
 shares of TMTG Common Stock, which amounts represent the difference between the actual conversion ratio, determined by Digital World’s board of directors upon
              closing of the Business Combination (which was determined to be 
1.348
:1), and a conversion ratio of 
2.00
:1. On September 16, 2024, the Chancery Court issued its order in this matter setting the conversion ratio at 
1.4911
:1.  The Chancery Court ruled against ARC on a substantial majority of its claims, reducing ARC’s proposed calculation of the conversion
              ratio of 
1.81
:1 by approximately 
70
%
              and holding that the former board members of Digital World did not breach any fiduciary duties in setting the conversion ratio calculation or in their public disclosures of the same. As a result of the Chancery Court’s order, a portion of the
              disputed conversion Common Stock held in escrow were released to ARC. The release of Common Stock is subject to the terms and conditions of the ARC Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent and TMTG. Accordingly, 
785,825
 shares of TMTG Common Stock, which represents the Court’s calculation for the difference between a ratio of 
1.348
:1 and 
1.4911
:1, were
              released from escrow (the “Court Ratio”). Both parties still retain the option to file an appeal within 
30
 days after the Chancery
              Court’s final order. In connection with the Chancery Court’s final order, 
238,692
 Common Shares deposited in the Non-ARC Class B
              Shareholders Escrow Agreement, representing the Court Ratio, were released to the applicable holders, subject to the terms and conditions of the Non-ARC Class B Shareholders Escrow Agreement and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On
              October 23, 2024, ARC filed a motion for a $
1,000,000
 fee award, which has since been fully briefed and is scheduled for argument
              on April 25, 2025.

Lawsuit against UAV, Litinsky, Moss,
              and Orlando in Florida

On March 24, 2024, Private TMTG filed
              a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit for Sarasota County, Florida (Docket No. 2024-CA-001545-NC) against UAV, Andrew Litinsky, Wesley Moss, and Patrick Orlando. In view of UAV’s repeated demands concerning its
              alleged stock ownership and director appointment rights, the complaint alleges claims for a declaratory judgment against UAV determining that the Services Agreement is unenforceable against Private TMTG. The complaint also asserts a claim for
              unjust enrichment against UAV based on its failure to competently provide services to the company. Finally, the complaint asserts claims for damages for (a) breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty against Mr. Litinsky and Mr. Moss based on
              their dealings with Mr. Orlando, (b) aiding and abetting and conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty against Mr. Orlando based on the same events, and (c) breach of the fiduciary duty of care against Mr. Litinsky and Mr. Moss for their gross
              negligence in managing the company. On April 25, 2024, Private TMTG filed a motion to consolidate this lawsuit with Docket No. 2024-CA-001061-NC (described above) for purposes of discovery and pretrial proceedings, which was denied without
              prejudice on August 2, 2024. On June 27, 2024, the court granted Mr. Moss, Mr. Litinsky, and UAV’s motion to stay proceedings pending resolution of the Delaware Action involving UAV. The court also denied Private TMTG’s motion for an
              anti-suit injunction. On July 3, 2024, Mr. Orlando filed a motion to dismiss. On July 17, 2024, Private TMTG sought review of the court’s order granting UAV’s motion to stay in Florida’s Second District Court of Appeal by filing a petition
              for a writ of certiorari with that court (Case No. 2D2024-1642). The court subsequently denied UAV’s motion to enforce the stay and Private TMTG’s motion to stay the stay pending certiorari review on September 2, 2024, and September 23, 2024,
              respectively. On December 11, 2024, the Second District Court of Appeal heard argument on Private TMTG’s appeal of the trial court’s order granting UAV’s motion to stay.

Litigation with Orlando in Delaware

On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff Patrick
              Orlando brought a lawsuit against Digital World in the Chancery Court seeking advancement of legal fees associated with Mr. Orlando’s involvement in civil litigation against Digital World in Florida and certain other matters (the “Advancement
              Lawsuit”) (C.A. No. 2024-0264-LWW). Mr. Orlando’s allegations relate to certain provisions in the Digital World Charter, Digital World’s bylaws, and an indemnity agreement allegedly entered into between Mr. Orlando and Digital World. Mr.
              Orlando alleges that those certain provisions require Digital World to pay the legal fees Mr. Orlando incurred and will incur in connection with legal proceedings in which he is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
              officer of Digital World. Mr. Orlando seeks a court order that (i) declares that he is entitled to legal fees for certain proceedings described in the complaint, (ii) requires Digital World to pay for legal fees incurred and future legal fees
              to be incurred for those proceedings, (iii) requires Digital World to pay the fees incurred to bring the Advancement Lawsuit, and (iv) requires Digital World to pay pre- and post-judgment interest on the amounts owed to Mr. Orlando. On April
              3, 2024, the Chancery Court entered a Stipulation and Advancement Order (“Stipulation”) stating that Mr. Orlando is entitled to advancement of attorneys’ fees and costs incurred with legal proceedings described in the Stipulation, subject to
              Digital World’s right to challenge the reasonableness of those attorneys’ fees and costs. The Stipulation further states that Mr. Orlando is entitled to fees incurred in connection with enforcement of advancement rights and sets forth
              procedures that will govern future requests for advancement of attorneys’ fees and costs. As of January 30, 2025, TMTG had paid or agreed to pay approximately $
3,500.0
 to Mr. Orlando’s attorneys pursuant to such Stipulation and TMTG’s other advancement obligations to Mr. Orlando. On April 23, 2024, Mr. Orlando filed a motion for leave to supplement the Advancement
              Lawsuit to add a claim for advancement of legal fees and expenses Mr. Orlando had incurred and would incur in connection with his defense of an action for declaratory judgment brought by members of ARC regarding Mr. Orlando’s removal as the
              managing member of ARC (the “ARC Removal Action”). Mr. Orlando also sought reimbursement for the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with his supplement to the Advancement Lawsuit, and he sought pre-judgment and post-judgment
              interest on the amounts he claimed were owed to him. On August 1, 2024, plaintiffs in the ARC Removal Action dismissed their complaint without prejudice. On August 8, 2024, Mr. Orlando dismissed his supplemental claims in the Advancement
              Lawsuit without prejudice. The Advancement Lawsuit remains open on the Chancery Court’s docket.

Litigation with Orlando and Benessere
              in Miami, Florida

On April 2, 2024, Patrick Orlando and
              Benessere Investment Group, LLC (“Benessere”) filed suit against TMTG in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial District in Miami-Dade County Florida (Docket No. 2024-005894-CA-01). Orlando and Benessere seek a declaratory judgment that
              TMTG is restricted from disclosing material exchanged with Orlando and Benessere pursuant to a joint defense agreement previously entered into by the Parties in addition to a request for damages for any breach of the joint defense agreement.
              Also on April 3, 2024, Orlando and Benessere filed a motion for preliminary injunction for enforcement of the joint defense agreement. As of January 30, 2025, the motion for preliminary injunction had not been set for hearing. On September
              30, 2024, the Court scheduled a three-day trial beginning on September 3, 2025.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Litigation with Odyssey Transfer &
              Trust Company in Delaware

On June 20, 2024, TMTG’s transfer
              agent, Odyssey filed an interpleader action in the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware (C.A. No. 24-CV-00729). The complaint pertains to the ongoing dispute regarding share ownership between Michael Melkersen and ARC and includes
              TMTG as a nominal defendant. Odyssey is seeking an order from the Court discharging Odyssey of further liability and requiring ARC and TMTG to resolve their competing claims as to 
716,140
 Class A shares of TMTG and 
25,000
 TMTG warrants.
              On July 17, 2024, Odyssey filed a motion to dismiss for discharge and dismissal. On July 18, 2024, ARC filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue. On July 22, 2024, TMTG filed a motion for discharge and dismissal. On August 13, 2024, TMTG
              filed its answer and crossclaims against Mr. Melkersen and ARC. On August 21, 2024, ARC filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 3, 2024, ARC filed a motion to dismiss TMTG’s crossclaims on the grounds
              of forum non conveniens. On October 14, 2024, Mr. Melkersen filed his answer to the complaint for interpleader. This matter remains pending.

Litigation with RejuveTotal in New
              York

On October 21, 2024, RejuveTotal LLC
              (“Rejuve”) filed suit against TMTG and its Chief Financial Officer in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (Index No. 655551/2024). The complaint alleged breach of contract, and sought equitable relief as well as
              indemnification and reimbursement of costs and expenses, in connection with Rejuve’s role as Purchaser Representative under the Merger Agreement. As of January 30, 2025, defendants in this matter had not yet been served.

On December 23, 2024, TMTG filed suit
              against Rejuve in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (Index No. 659834/2024). In the complaint, TMTG seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against Rejuve arising out of Rejuve’s alleged conduct as Purchaser
              Representative under an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 20, 2021. On January 13, 2025, TMTG filed an application, by way of a proposed order to show cause, for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Rejuve from taking any
              further action in its alleged capacity as Purchaser Representative under the Merger Agreement. On January 23, 2025, the Court approved a stipulation to stay the action pending resolution of the arbitration before the American Arbitration
              Association seeking to recover its fees and expenses from TMTG that Rejuve allegedly incurred as Purchaser Representative (which TMTG presently anticipates will be concluded in March 2025), and to enjoin Rejuve from acting as Purchaser
              Representative except with respect to its participation in the arbitration.

NOTE 17 – SEGMENT INFORMATION

We report our operating results through 
one
 reportable
        segment: social media and streaming.

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as of December 31, 2024, was our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to
        our segment based on our consolidated net loss and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA).  Segment EBITDA is defined as segment revenue less operating costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and
        amortization, interest income or expense (net), provision or benefit for income taxes, change in fair value of derivative liabilities, and stock-based compensation expense.  We believe Segment EBITDA serves as a measure that assists our CODM and
        our investors in comparing our segment performance on a consistent basis.

To date, we have generated limited advertising revenue through Truth Social and no advertising revenue through our newly launched streaming operations, Truth+. We
        expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we build and grow our streaming and infrastructure operations.  Our CODM does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources;
        therefore, we do not provide disclosure of assets by segment.

Review of cash forecast models is used to assess the entity-wide result and performance, and inform investment decisions by our CODM.  Net loss and Segment EBITDA are
        used to monitor budgeted versus actual results.  Additionally, review of budgeted versus actual results is used in assessing performance of the segment.

The following table presents our segment information for the periods indicated and, because we currently only have 
one
 segment, net income/(loss) is identical to the information presented in the “Consolidated Statement of Operations” above:
