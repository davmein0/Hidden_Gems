Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The management of Enovix Corporation are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “Enovix.”
Business Overview
We design, develop and have started to commercially manufacture an advanced silicon-anode lithium-ion battery using our proprietary cell architecture that increases energy density and maintains high cycle life. This enables us to use silicon as the only active lithium cycling material in the anode whereas industry incumbents have historically combined only a modest amount of silicon with graphite. We have applied an equally innovative approach to develop proprietary roll-to-stack production tools for existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing lines and increase megawatt hour capacity. Our silicon anode battery architecture allows lithium-ion batteries to be produced smaller, cheaper and more efficiently at scale than current alternatives. With our acquisition of Routejade, Inc. (“Routejade”) in 2023, we also offer conventional lithium-ion batteries, which expands our suite of battery offerings to our customers.
To date, we have concentrated our operational effort on researching, developing and commercializing the cutting-edge technology behind our silicon-anode lithium-ion battery. We have agreements to provide engineering and proof of concept samples to several market leading smartphone customers, and have advanced relationships with customers in the augmented reality/virtual reality (“AR/VR”) industry and smart eyewear market. We also operate in the defense market with sales of conventional graphite battery products to defense customers. In addition to the smartphone, AR/VR, smart eyewear and defense industries, we are pursuing the deployment of our technology for the electric vehicle (“EV”) market.
We currently lease our headquarters in Fremont, California. We commenced commercial manufacturing operations and recognized our first product revenue in the second quarter of 2022 from our first production line (“Fab1”). In 2023, we identified a facility in Malaysia (“Fab2”) for high-volume production. We relocated our Fab1 production line to Fab2 in the second quarter of 2024 and officially opened our Fab2 production facility in Malaysia in August 2024. In October 2024, we commenced shipping battery cells from our first production line, the“Agility line” at Fab2. As of the end of 2024, we had completed Site Acceptance Testing (“SAT”) for our Agility and High-Volume Manufacturing (“HVM”) lines and delivered samples of our smartphone batteries, EX-1M and EX-2M, to customers. We currently expect to commence mass production at Fab2 in late 2025. 
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to December 31.

Accordingly, we will have a 53-week fiscal year every five or six years and our fiscal year 2026 will consist of 53 weeks. Our fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 consisted of 52 weeks, which ended on December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, respectively. All period references are to the fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.
Routejade Acquisition
On October 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Routejade, Inc. (“Routejade”), an established battery manufacturer in South Korea. This acquisition allowed us to vertically integrate electrode coating and battery pack manufacturing, in addition to adding to our suite of battery offerings with conventional lithium-ion batteries. The total purchase consideration of such transaction consisted of cash consideration in the amount of $15.4 million, net of acquisition-related seller expense, and 5,923,521 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001, for the purchase of substantially all of outstanding shares of Routejade (the “Routejade Acquisition”). Please refer to Note 3 “Business Combinations” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of this acquisition.
Key Trends, Opportunities and Uncertainties
We generate revenue from the sale of (a) batteries and battery pack products (“Product Revenue”) and (b) engineering revenue contracts (“Service Revenue”) for the development of lithium-ion battery technology. Our

performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities, but also pose risks and challenges as described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Fiscal Year 
2024
 Highlights:
•
During the first quarter of 2024, we had built out approximately 250,000 square feet of factory space at our facility in Malaysia (“Fab2”) and had begun receiving shipments of our second generation (“Gen2”) manufacturing lines production equipment that had cleared FAT. In addition, we entered into a development agreement with a leading automaker to validate the potential advantages of the Enovix cell architecture for the EV battery. 
•
In the first half of 2024, we received total net proceeds of $40.0 million from the issuance of our common stock under our at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program in the first and second quarters of 2024.
•
During the second quarter of 2024, we completed SAT for our Agility line in Malaysia and commenced battery production on our Agility line. In addition, we began sampling our EX-1M battery with samples that were built and tested at our Fab1 in Fremont, California. We also signed an agreement with a leading California-based technology company to provide silicon batteries and packs for a mixed reality headset.
•
During the second quarter of 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) to relocate our manufacturing operations from Fremont, California to Malaysia. We substantially completed our 2024 Restructuring Plan in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the fiscal year 2024, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $41.8 million, which included $38.2 million of Fab1 long-lived asset disposals.
•
During the third quarter of 2024, we formally opened Fab2 in Penang, Malaysia, and subsequently commenced shipping batteries to customers from our Agility line. We also achieved UN38.3 certification for our EX-1M product, marking a critical milestone for market entry. Additionally, we signed a collaboration agreement with a Fortune 200 company to provide silicon batteries for a fast-growing IoT product category and a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a high-performance, global automotive OEM aimed at scaling the Enovix cell architecture for the EV market.
•
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we issued 11,626,089 shares of our common stock in a private offering and received total proceeds of $106.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs. In addition, we completed SAT for our HVM line at Fab2 and successfully completed safety testing of our EX-1M cells. We also expanded our active customer engagements to seven of the top eight smartphone OEMs and shipped early samples of EX-2M to a smartphone customer.
Product Development
We have developed and delivered standardized sample (i.e., prototype) lithium-ion batteries to multiple, industry leading consumer electronics manufacturers with energy densities higher than industry standard batteries of similar size. “Energy density” is measured as the product of the power a battery puts out in watts times the number of hours the battery can put out that power, divided by the volume (size) of the battery measured in liters. The units of energy density are thus watt-hours per liter or Wh/l. Additionally, we estimate that our batteries can deliver higher storage capacity (measured in milliampere/hour, or mAh) compared to industry standard batteries of similar size.
Our product development strategy is tightly aligned with the goals of meeting the market needs of higher energy density, cycle life, and fast charge while maintaining safety. In the third quarter of 2024, we shipped our first samples of EX-1M from Fab2 to our customers. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we shipped our early engineering samples of EX-2M to our smartphone customer. We have kicked off the design phase of EX-3M and our goal is to finalize the EX-3M design in early 2025, paving the way for our next-generation battery technology.
Commercialization
We approach our commercialization strategy by identifying customer requirements and determining where our battery architecture will offer the greatest value. In 2023, we added a product management team to interface with customers, collect these requirements, and feed these learnings into our technology roadmap. In 2024, we added a product design team in Penang, Malaysia to help ensure that our high-volume manufacturing lines meet customer product requirements.

Prior to 2023, our go-to-market strategy was to sample many customers across a broad set of end markets with a standard size battery while selectively considering customized batteries by size for certain customers. This is referred to as a horizontal business strategy. In 2023, we shifted our go-to-market strategy to a vertical business strategy based on our determination that it is more efficient to work with a smaller number of large customers and build highly customized batteries to their needs. With the shift to a vertical business strategy, we have put a particular emphasis on the largest end markets for portable electronics batteries, and in 2024, have made progress with securing development and collaboration agreements with potential customers in the portable electronics market. We are also exploring incremental growth opportunities in the conventional battery business, with allied defense customers, among other markets.
Our primary commercialization goal for 2025 is mass production of our batteries for smartphone customers. 
Market Focus and Market Expansion
We are focused on four strategic markets: Smartphone, IoT, Computing and Defense.

We also plan to expand into the EV market. 
We prioritize large, high-value markets, such as smartphones and AR/VR headsets, where the need for higher energy density commands a premium. This approach has proven to be visionary, with the surge in AI-enabled smartphones and the emerging AI-enabled smart eyewear market further validating our strategy and driving significant pull for our products. We are confident that our go-to-market strategy positions us on an expedient path to profitability while maintaining a competitive edge in innovation.
In the smartphone market, we shipped early engineering samples of EX-2M to one smartphone customer in the fourth quarter of 2024, with results confirming that critical safety tests are passing. In continuation of this agreement, we received battery dimensions for custom sample qualification and planned 2025 commercial launch. We remain on track for commercial smartphone battery launches in 2025, pending successful completion of customer qualification.
A significant portion of our 2024 revenue came from sales of conventional graphite battery products to defense contractor customers in South Korea. We also observed an increase in inbound interest from drone manufacturers and defense suppliers seeking battery solutions that comply with allied country supply chain requirements, unlock energy-restricted capabilities such as satellite communications and sensor fusion, and are intrinsically safer.
We believe that focusing on the portable electronics market, such as the smartphone and IoT categories, will allow us to leverage our differentiated technology and solidify our manufacturing process while still driving toward profitability. At the same time, we are also laying the groundwork for our entry into the EV battery market by sampling batteries to EV OEMs and continuing work on our three-year grant with the U.S. Department of Energy to demonstrate batteries featuring our silicon anode paired with EV-class cathode materials. Our goal is to expand into the EV market through joint ventures or licensing arrangements with EV OEMs or battery OEMs in order to commercialize our technology in this end market. 
Access to Capital
Assuming we experience no significant delays in the production plan nor any deterioration in capital efficiency, we believe that our cash resources are sufficient to fund the manufacturing and production ramp of our Fab2 manufacturing facility in Malaysia for commercial launch.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
In June 2022, we began to generate revenue from our Fab1 in Fremont, California. In October 2023, we acquired Routejade, a manufacturer of electrode coating and battery pack for customers worldwide. We recognize revenue within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

Our revenue consists of product revenue, resulting from the sale of lithium-ion batteries. and battery pack products (“Product Revenue”), and service revenue, resulting from payments received from our customers based on executed engineering revenue contracts for the development of lithium-ion battery technology (“Service Revenue”). 
Our Product Revenue is primarily generated from selling lithium-ion batteries or battery packs to commercial customers and defense contractors. Product Revenue is recognized once we have satisfied the performance obligations as defined in the sales agreement, which is generally satisfied upon transfer of control of goods. Control is transferred upon delivery for our products. For certain customized products with customer acceptance criteria specified in the sales 
51
Table of Contents
agreement, the performance obligations are generally satisfied upon our customer’s acceptance. Payment terms can vary depending on the contract and it is generally required within 90 days or less from the delivery date or the acceptance date of our product. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration for the product sold.
Service Revenue contracts generally include the design and development efforts to conform our existing battery technology with customers’ specifications. Consideration for Service Revenue contracts generally becomes payable when we meet specific payment milestones, which usually include the design and approval of custom cells, procurement of fabrication tooling to meet the customer’s specifications, and the fabrication and delivery of custom cells from our facility. Within the existing Service Revenue contracts, the amount of consideration is fixed, the contracts contain a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized at the point in time the final milestone is met (i.e., a final working prototype meeting all required specifications) and the customer obtains control of the deliverable. 
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes materials, labor, depreciation and amortization expense, freight costs and other direct costs related to manufacturing our products and service contracts. Labor consists of personnel-related expenses such as salaries and benefits, and stock-based compensation. We anticipate that cost of revenue will continue to increase as we optimize and bring-up our production line.
Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”) on a first-in and first-out basis. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves projecting average selling prices. When the estimated net realizable values are below the manufacturing costs, a charge to cost of revenue is recorded.
Capitalization of certain costs are recognized as an asset if they relate directly to a customer contract, generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. If these three criteria are not met, the costs are expensed in the period incurred. Deferred costs are recognized as cost of revenue in the period when the related revenue is recognized.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of engineering services, allocated facilities costs, depreciation, development expenses, materials, labor and stock-based compensation related primarily to our (i) technology development, (ii) design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models, and (iii) certain costs related to the design, construction and operation of our pilot plant that are not of a scale economically feasible to us for commercial production. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
To date, research and development expenses have consisted primarily of personnel-related expenses for scientists, experienced engineers and technicians as well as costs associated with the expansion and ramp up of our engineering and manufacturing facility, materials and supplies to support the product development and process engineering efforts. As we ramp up our engineering operations to complete the development of batteries and required process engineering to meet customer specifications, we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we expand hiring of scientists, engineers and technicians and continue to invest in additional plant and equipment for product development, building prototypes and testing of batteries. We established a research and development center in India to focus on developing machine learning algorithms, battery modeling, material screening and electrolyte optimization. We also established a research and development team in Malaysia. 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, marketing expenses, allocated facilities expenses, depreciation expenses, travel expenses, acquisition costs, and professional services expenses, including legal, human resources, audit, accounting and tax-related services. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Facilities costs consist of rent and maintenance of facilities.
We are expanding our personnel headcount to support the ramping up of commercial manufacturing. Accordingly, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the near term and for the foreseeable future.

Impairment of Equipment and Restructuring Cost
Impairment of equipment was a result of our disposal of machinery and equipment that were identified to have no future or alternative usage. 
Restructuring cost was the result of our restructuring plans in 2023 and 2024, which included workforce reductions, relocation of our Fab1 manufacturing operations from California to Malaysia and disposals of our long-lived assets located in Fremont that have no future or alternative use. Please refer to Note 15 “Restructuring Costs” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income and expense primarily consists of dividend income, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency transaction gain or loss and fair value adjustments for outstanding common stock warrants.
Income Tax
Our income tax provision consists of an estimate for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in the tax law. We maintain a valuation allowance against the full value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because we believe the recoverability of the tax assets is not more likely than not. Since our acquisition of Routejade and our establishment of operations in Malaysia and India in the fiscal year 2023, we became subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries.

Revenue
Revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was $23.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Revenue in both years primarily resulted from the product shipments from our facility in South Korea, which was acquired in October 2023. Revenue for fiscal year 2023 included $7.3 million of revenue from the Routejade acquisition. 
The $15.4 million increase in revenue was primarily attributable to earning a full year of product revenue from the acquired business of Routejade in fiscal year 2024 versus only two months of revenue from the acquired business in fiscal year 2023. Of the $15.4 million increase in revenue compared to fiscal year 2023, $6.4 million of that increase was derived from higher shipment volumes to a South Korea defense contractor, and the remaining increase was attributable to higher shipment volumes to consumer electronics customers. 
For fiscal years 2024 and 2023, revenue from a South Korea defense contractor accounted for approximately 50% and 75% of our total revenue, respectively. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $7.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively, of deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was $25.1 million, compared to $63.1 million for the prior fiscal year 2023. The decrease of $37.9 million or 60% was primarily attributable to the fact that 
there was no production generated from Fab1 during the fiscal year 
2024. 
With no production in Fab1 and minimal production in Fab2 in fiscal year 2024, a majority of the factory expenses associated with Fab1 and Fab2 were classified as research and development expenses 
54
Table of Contents
instead of cost of revenues in fiscal year 2024. The transition from Fab1 to Fab2 was a part of
 the 2023 and 2024 Restructuring Plans 
(as defined in Note 15 “Restructuring Costs” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These restructuring plans also included U.S. workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the second half of fiscal year 2024. In addition, t
he decreases in the cost of revenue were partially offset by 
inventory write-offs of $1.8 million and a $17.1 million increase in manufacturing costs associated with the increase of revenue as compared to fiscal year 2023.
In addition, we anticipate our factory expenses will increase as we continue to hire additional personnel to support the Fab2 production lines and our Fab2 manufacturing facility.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the fiscal year 2024 were $124.5 million, compared to $88.4 million for the fiscal year 2023. The increase of $36.1 million, or 41%, was primarily attributable to $16.2 million of overhead costs being recorded as R&D expenses (previously recorded as cost of revenue) as a result of the transition of Fab1 to focus on R&D in 2024 and there was no production generated from Fab1 or Fab2. In addition, there was a $13.9 million increase in depreciation expense, a $9.6 million increase in information technology and facility costs, and a $6.3 million increase in material and tooling costs, which included a $1.4 million increase of intangible amortization for the acquired technology from the Routejade Acquisition. Furthermore, we had a net $0.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased headcount in Asia, offset by workforce reductions in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by a one-time severance, benefits and stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million in connection with the departures of certain executives and senior management in 2023.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year 2024 were $74.3 million, compared to $79.0 million for the fiscal year 2023. The decrease of $4.7 million, or 6%, was primarily attributable to one-time severance, benefits and stock-based compensation expense of $17.9 million in connection with the departure of certain officers and executives in fiscal year 2023, a $5.9 million decrease in information technology, professional fees and facility costs, and $1.3 million of acquisition costs in connection with the Routejade Acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by a $12.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense (excluding the decrease in stock-based compensation associated with the departure of certain officers and executives), a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $2.4 million increase in intangible amortization for the acquired intangible assets from the acquisition of Routejade, a $1.0 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $0.9 million of net increase in miscellaneous expenses. 
Impairment of Equipment
There was no impairment of equipment recorded for fiscal year 2024, while we recorded $4.4 million of impairment of equipment for fiscal year 2023 related to the disposal of machinery and equipment that were identified to have no future or alternative usage. These impaired assets were previously capitalized in the “Machinery and equipment” category of property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Restructuring Cost
In May 2024, we initiated the 2024 Restructuring Plan 
(as defined in Note 15 “Restructuring Costs” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K)
 to relocate our Fab1 manufacturing operations in Fremont, California to Malaysia. As a result, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $41.8 million for the fiscal year 2024, which consisted of non-cash charges of $38.2 million of loss on disposals of Fab1 long-lived assets located in Fremont, $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, cash charges of $1.6 million of severance and termination benefits and $0.8 million of other charges.
In October 2023, the 2023 Restructuring Plan 
(as defined in Note 15 “Restructuring Costs” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) included
 $3.0 million of restructuring costs recorded during fiscal year 2023, which consisted of $2.4 million of severance and termination benefits and stock-based compensation expense and $0.6 million of inventory costs.
Change in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrants

For fiscal year 2024, the change in fair value of common stock warrants of $12.2 million was mainly attributable to a decrease in the fair value of the 5,500,000 Private Placement Warrants 
(as defined in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
The 
55
Table of Contents
decrease in fair value of Private Placement Warrants was primarily due to a decrease in our common stock price during the current year. In addition, there was 
a decrease in the number of warrants outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2024 as there was a warrant exercise of 500,000 shares during the fiscal year 2024
.
For fiscal year 2023, the change in fair value of common stock warrants of $6.2 million was attributable to a decrease in the fair value of the 6,000,000 Private Placement Warrants. The decrease in fair value of Private Placement Warrants was primarily due to a decrease in our common stock price during the year 2023. 
Interest Income
Interest income for fiscal year 2024 was $12.3 million, compared to $14.1 million during fiscal year 2023. The decrease of $1.7 million was primarily due to the fact that we received lower dividend income and interest income as we had lower cash balance in the fiscal year 2024 compared to the fiscal year 2023. 
Interest Expense
Interest expense for fiscal year 2024 was $6.8 million, compared to $4.5 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase of $2.3 million, or 52%, was primarily attributable to the fact that the Convertible Senior Notes were issued in April 2023. Accordingly, we recognized a full year of interest expense in the fiscal year 2024 as compared to approximately 8.5 months of interest expense recognized for the fiscal year 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception through December 29, 2024 and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $274.7 million, 
working capital of $241.3 million and an accumulated deficit of $821.1 million. 
For the fiscal year 2024, we received net proceeds of $40.0 million from the issuance of our common stock under our ATM program. In addition, we sold 11,626,089 shares of our common stock and received proceeds of $106.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Material Cash Requirements
As of December 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $274.7 million. We currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2025, we expect that our spending in cost of revenues and operating expenses will continue to increase as we ramp up our Fab2 operations and build additional production lines.
For the fiscal year 2024, we purchased $76.2 million of property and equipment. We will continue to increase our property and equipment purchases in the near future to support the build-out of our manufacturing facilities and our battery manufacturing equipment. See more discussion on contractual obligations and commitments in the section below.
Based on the anticipated spending and timing of expenditures to support operational development and market expansion, we currently expect that our cash will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements over the next twelve months from the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of available cash, cash equivalents and future debt financings, and access to other public or private equity offerings as well as potential strategic arrangements. We have made our estimates on historical experience and various other relevant factors and we believe that they are reasonable. Actual results may differ from our estimates, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.

Comparison of Fiscal Year

 to Prior Fiscal Year 
2023
Operating Activities
Our cash flows used in operating activities to date have been primarily comprised of operating expenses. We continue to increase hiring for employees in supporting the ramping up of commercial manufacturing. We expect our cash used in operating activities to increase significantly before we start to generate any material cash inflows from commercially manufacturing and selling our batteries.
Net cash used in operating activities was $108.6 million for the fiscal year 2024. Net cash used in operating activities consists of net loss of $222.5 million, adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments primarily include a decrease in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants of $12.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $58.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $45.0 million and impairment and loss on disposal of long-lived assets of $38.3 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was $104.6 million for the fiscal year 2023. Net cash used in operating activities consists of net loss of $214.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments primarily include the change in fair value of common stock warrants of $6.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $69.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $34.0 million and impairment of equipment of $4.4 million.
Investing Activities
Our cash flows used in investing activities to date have been primarily comprised of purchases of property and equipment. Starting in the second quarter of 2023, we began to purchase short-term investments. We expect the costs to acquire property and equipment to increase in the future as we continue to build-out our Fab2 and develop our battery manufacturing production lines in Malaysia. Net cash used in investing activities, which were primarily related to equipment purchases, were $76.2 million and $61.8 million for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
During the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we purchased $31.8 million and $138.3 million of investments, respectively. In addition, we had $106.6 million and $67.2 million of investments mature during the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. In October 2023, we used cash, net of cash acquired, of $10.0 million and 5,923,521 shares of our common stock to purchase substantially all of the outstanding shares of Routejade.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $150.7 million for the fiscal year 2024, which primarily consisted of $107.2 million of proceeds, net of paid issuance costs, from issuance of common stock, $40.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our ATM program, $4.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock, $4.6 million of proceeds from the borrowings of short-term loans and $1.5 million of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) to purchase our common stock, partially offset by $7.1 million of payroll tax payments for shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units. 
Net cash provided by financing activities was $159.6 million for the fiscal year 2023, which primarily consisted of $172.5 million of gross proceeds from the Convertible Senior Notes, $11.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock and $2.4 million of proceeds from our ESPP to purchase our common stock,

Table of Contents
partially offset by $17.3 million of capped call transaction costs, $5.9 million of debt issuance costs, and $3.9 million of payroll tax payments for shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units. 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As of December 29, 2024, we had $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes outstanding, which will mature on May 1, 2028 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Please see Note 9 “Borrowings” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
We lease our headquarters in Fremont, California, our Fab2 in Penang, Malaysia, and offices in India and China. For the lease payment schedule, please see Note 7 “Leases,” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
We expect to enter into other commitments to support our product development, the build-out of our manufacturing facilities, and our business development, which are generally cancellable upon notice. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with various vendors, which are generally cancellable upon notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of service providers, up to the date of cancellation. As of December 29, 2024, our commitments included approximately $17.4 million of our open purchase orders, including equipment purchase orders, and contractual obligations that occurred in the ordinary course of business. For contractual obligations, please See Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. These estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to: depreciable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets, impairment of equipment, valuation for inventory, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, assumptions used in income tax provisions, valuation for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions used in stock-based compensation, incremental borrowing rate for operating right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, restructuring costs, and estimates to fair value of common stock warrants.
A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that application of the following accounting policies involves our subjective judgement, estimates and assumptions, which have had or are reasonable likely to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
Common Stock Warrant Liabilities
In connection with 2021 business combination with Rodgers Silicon Valley Acquisition Corp., we issued outstanding warrants of 17.5 million to purchase common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. These warrants consisted of 11,500,000 warrants held by the third-party investors (the “Public Warrants”) and 6,000,000 warrants issued to a private placement to the sponsor and members of Rodgers Capital LLC (the “Private Placement Warrants”). As of December 29, 2024, there were 5,500,000 outstanding shares of the Private Placement Warrants and no Public Warrants outstanding.
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants as of December 29, 2024. The estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value per share of the underlying shares of our Common Stock, risk free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility of the price of the underlying Common Stock and a probability weighted expected term of the warrants. The most 
58
Table of Contents
significant assumptions impacting the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants are the fair value of our common stock as of each re-measurement date and expected price volatility of our Common Stock, which included consideration of our historical observed volatility and other additional factors that were deemed relevant. The warrant liability is adjusted for changes in the fair value at each reporting date and recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Private Placement Warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until they are exercised or expired. For further information, see Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
As of December 29, 2024, our goodwill, customer relationship intangibles and other intangibles, net were $12.2 million and $36.4 million, respectively. We perform periodic reviews of significant identified intangible assets and goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts for specific products. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Based on our 2024 impairment analysis, there was no impairment to our intangible assets and goodwill for the periods presented.
Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees generally in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). We also offer employee stock purchase plan (the “2021 ESPP”) to our employees. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date for all stock-based awards made to employees, consultants and directors based on the grant date fair value of the equity award. To determine the grant date fair value of the equity awards, we use the last reported sales price of our common stock on the grant date for RSUs and PRSUs and we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model with several assumptions and estimates to derive the grant date fair value of our stock options and ESPP shares. Since fiscal year 2022, we did not issue stock options.
For the PRSUs, stock-based compensation cost is recognized based on the grant date fair value and the expected performance achievement percentage of meeting the performance milestones. At each reporting period, we assess and determine the expected performance achievement percentage. The change in the expected performance achievement percentage could have an impact on the stock-based compensation expense until the end of each performance periods. For further information, see Note 14 “Stock-based Compensation” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment exist. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated separately identifiable, undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows. If we cease to develop and automate certain equipment or our equipment is underutilized or idled, the carrying value of such equipment may be lower than its estimated fair value, which could result in future impairment loss. There was no impairment of equipment recorded for the fiscal year 2024 while we recorded $4.4 million of impairment of equipment for the fiscal year 2023 related to the disposal of machinery and equipment that were identified to have no future or alternative usage.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See section “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” of Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and foreign currency risk, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks.
59
Table of Contents
Interest Rate Risk
The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of December 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $274.7 million. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held in cash deposits, money market funds and interest bearing account. We do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair value of our cash equivalents. 
As of December 29, 2024, we had $172.5 million of Convertible Senior Notes with an annual interest rate of 3.0%, which accounted for approximately 94% of our total debt before debt issuance costs, and the other borrowings are mostly with fixed interest rates. As such, we do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of our borrowing activities.
Uncertain financial markets could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income and credit markets.
Foreign Currency Risk
In fiscal year 2024, we conducted operations in the U.S. and Asia. The majority of our expenses, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars in fiscal year 2024. Our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to risks typical of operations outside of the U.S. including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Our operating results in the international subsidiaries for fiscal year 2024 was not material. If a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rate was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities on December 29, 2024, the effect of such change would not be material to our consolidated financial condition or our results of operations.
Given the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enovix Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enovix Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Variable Interest Entity – Refer to Notes 2 and 16 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On October 29, 2024, the Company amended its agreement with YBS International Berhad (“YBS”), a Malaysia-based company. Management evaluated the manufacturing agreement, as amended (the “Amended Agreement”), and concluded the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”) as defined in ASC 810, 
Consolidations
.
We identified management’s assessment of whether the Amended Agreement provides the Company with a controlling financial interest in a VIE as a critical audit matter due to the complexity of applying the accounting principles of ASC 810 to the Amended Agreement. 
62
Table of Contents
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the assessment of whether the Amended Agreement provides the Company with a controlling financial interest in a VIE included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s accounting for unique or complex transactions, specifically, the determination of whether the Amended Agreement provided the Company with a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
•
We read and evaluated the terms of the Amended Agreement, and inquired of management and legal counsel, to understand the legal entities involved, the rights and responsibilities of each party, and the related commercial terms.
•
With the assistance of our accounting specialists, we evaluated the Company’s conclusion that it does not have a controlling financial interest in a VIE as a result of the Amended Agreement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enovix Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Enovix Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 29, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. 
Organization and Basis of Presentation
Organization 
Enovix Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Enovix” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 2006. We design, develop, manufacture and commercialize next generation Lithium-ion, or Li-ion, battery cells that significantly increase the amount of energy density and storage capacity relative to conventional battery cells. Our batteries’ mechanical design, or “architecture,” allows us to use high performance chemistries while enabling safety and charge time advantages. Enovix is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a region of California, with offices and facilities in Asia.
Prior to the second quarter of 2022, we focused on the development and commercialization of lithium-ion batteries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we began our production of lithium-ion batteries or battery pack products and generated product revenue from our first production line (“Fab1”) in California in addition to service revenue from our engineering service contracts for the development of lithium-ion battery technology. In the fiscal year 2023, we were in process of building our facility in Malaysia (“Fab2”) for high-volume production and acquired Routejade, Inc. (“Routejade”), an established battery manufacturer in South Korea for battery pack manufacturing. In fiscal year 2024, our Fab2 facility opened with multiple production lines, include our first high-volume line (“Agility line”) and high-volume manufacturing (“HVM”) line.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to December 31.

Accordingly, we will have a 53-week fiscal year every five or six years and our fiscal year 2026 will consist of 53 weeks. Our fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 consisted of 52 weeks, which ended on December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, respectively. All period references are to the fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries, the business combinations from the closing dates and a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under the variable interest model. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation
Certain prior period amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception through December 29, 2024 and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 29, 2024, we had working capital of $
241.3
 million and an accumulated deficit of $
821.1
 million. In April 2023, we issued $
172.5
 million aggregate principal amount of 
3.0
% convertible senior notes due 2028 (the “Convertible Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the Convertible Senior Notes were approximately $
166.6
 million. We used approximately $
17.3
 million of the net proceeds from the offerings of the Convertible Senior Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions entered on April 20, 2023 in connection with such offerings. We use the remaining net proceeds for the construction of our Fab2 and production lines, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. See Note 9 “Borrowings” for more information. In October 2023, we purchased substantially all of the outstanding shares of Routejade. The purchase price, net of cash acquired was $
62.7
 million. See Note 3 “Business Combinations” for more information. During the fiscal year 2024, we received net proceeds of $
40.0
 million from the issuance of our common stock through an at-the-market (“ATM”) offering and proceeds of $
106.7
 million, net of estimated issuance costs, from the issuance of our common stock through a secondary offering.

ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Based on the anticipated spending and timing of expenditures, we currently expect that our cash will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements over the next twelve months. Going forward, we may require additional financing for our future operations and expansion. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to: depreciable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets, impairment of equipment, valuation for inventory, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, assumptions used in income tax provisions, valuation for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions used in stock-based compensation, incremental borrowing rate for operating right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, restructuring costs, and estimates to fair value of common stock warrants. Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Segment Reporting
We operate in 
one
 segment. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has been identified as our CODM, who reviews operating results to make decisions and assesses performance for the Company as a whole. Total available cash and cash equivalents, total revenues and net loss are used by our CEO to evaluate key operating decisions, such as company strategy, and determine and allocate resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate in one segment, all significant segment expenses and financial information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes of the consolidated financial statements.
 See Note 18 “Segment and Geographic Information” for more information.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash is primarily comprised of $
1.8
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively, of deposits to secure the advanced payment made by our customer. The restricted cash is classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other assets, non-current of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Investments
Our investments consist of highly liquid fixed-income securities. We determine the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each consolidated balance sheet date. We classified and accounted for our investments as available-for-sale securities as we may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, including prior to maturity. 
Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, investments with maturities beyond one year at the time of purchase that are highly liquid in nature and represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations are classified as current assets.
Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the security is sold, the security has matured, or the security has realized. Realized gains and losses on these investments are calculated based on the specific identification method and would be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Table of Contents
ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
We designated all investments as available-for-sale and, therefore, the investments are subject to periodic impairment under the available-for-sale debt security impairment model. Available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. We evaluate the remaining securities to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. A decline in fair value attributable to expected credit losses is recorded to Other income (expense), net, while any portion of the loss related to non-credit factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. For securities sold prior to maturity, the cost of the securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Trade Accounts Receivable, Notes Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Our accounts receivable and notes receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts less allowance for any credit losses. According to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13 that we adopted in the fiscal year 2022, we recognize credit losses based on a forward-looking current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model. We make estimates of expected credit losses based upon the assessment of various factors, including the age of receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The allowance for credit losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The uncollectible receivables are written off in the period in which a determination is made that all commercially reasonable means of recovering them have been exhausted.
 We recognized an immaterial amount of allowance for expected credit loss as of December 29, 2024 and there was 
no
 write-off of accounts receivable for the periods presented. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accounts receivable, net were $
4.6
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively. As of December 29, 2024, we have an immaterial amount of notes receivable and $
1.5
 million of our notes receivable as of December 31, 2023. 
Credit Losses
We are exposed to credit losses primarily through the available-for-sale investments. We invest excess cash in marketable securities with high credit ratings that are classified in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Our investment portfolio at any point in time contains investments in United States (“U.S.”) treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities and money market funds, and are classified as available-for-sale. We assess whether our available-for sale investments are impaired at each reporting period.
 As December 29, 2024, we did not have any investments. As of December 31, 2023, we did not recognize an allowance for expected credit losses related to available-for-sale investments. 
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”) on a first-in and first-out (“FIFO”) basis. 
Inventory costs include direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. 
Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves projecting average selling prices. When the estimated net realizable values are below the manufacturing costs, a charge to cost of revenue is recorded.
The cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excess or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

See Note 6 “Inventory” for more information.
Property and Equipment, net 
Property and equipment, net are stated at the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Construction in process is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. 
Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the following assets below.

When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period of disposition. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period incurred.
 See Note 5 “Property and Equipment” for more information. 
Capitalized Software Costs for Internal Use
We capitalize direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use software, including enterprise-wide business software, that are incurred during the application development stage. These capitalized costs are recorded as capitalized software within property and equipment. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once the software is ready for its intended use, amounts capitalized are amortized over an estimated useful life of up to 
five years
, generally on a straight-line basis. Capitalized software costs for internal use are included in office equipment category of the property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment exist. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated separately identifiable, undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
 See Note 5 “Property and Equipment” for more information. 
Intangible Assets
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. We perform periodic reviews of significant long-lived assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and the forecasts for specific products. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.
 Based on our 2024 impairment analysis, there was 
no
 impairment to the intangible assets for the periods presented. 
Leases
We measure our lease obligations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, 
Leases
 , which requires us to recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for leases with terms of more than 12 months. We determine lease classification at the inception of an arrangement and recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Currently, we only have operating leases.
ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made on or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when we are reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease ROU assets and 
75

liabilities. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 7 “Leases” for more information.
Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on our 2024 impairment analysis, there was 
no
 goodwill impairment for the periods presented. See Note 3 “Business Combinations” for more information.
Debt
We accounted for our borrowings as liabilities measured at net proceeds less debt discount and debt issuance cost and were accreted to its face value over its expected term using the effective interest method. We considered whether there were any embedded features in its debt instruments that required bifurcation and separate accounting as derivative financial instruments pursuant to ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”).
 See Note 9 “Borrowings” for more information.
Common Stock Warrants
In connection with the 2021 business combination with Rodgers Silicon Valley Acquisition Corp., we issued outstanding warrants of 
17.5
 million to purchase common stock at a price of $
11.50
 per share. These warrants consisted of 
11,500,000
 warrants held by the third-party investors (the “Public Warrants”) and 
6,000,000
 warrants issued to a private placement to the sponsor and members of Rodgers Capital LLC (the “Private Placement Warrants”). The warrants expire 
five years
 from the completion of the business combination and were exercisable starting December 5, 2021. There are no outstanding Public Warrants since fiscal year 2022. 
The Private Placement Warrants are transferable, assignable or salable in certain limited exceptions. The Private Placement Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will cease to be Private Placement Warrants, and become Public Warrants and be redeemable by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the other Public Warrants.
We account for the warrants in accordance with ASC 815, 
Derivative and Hedging
. The Private Placement Warrants contain exercise and settlement features that may change with a change in the holder, which precludes the Private Placement Warrants from being indexed to our own stock, and therefore the Private Placement Warrants are precluded from being classified within equity and are accounted for as derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations at each reporting date.
 As of December 29, 2024, there were 
5,500,000
 outstanding shares of the Private Placement Warrants and 
no
 Public Warrants outstanding. See Note 12 “Warrants” for more information. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our assets and liabilities, which require fair value measurement on a recurring basis, consist of Private Placement Warrants recorded at fair value. Fair value principles require disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based upon significant levels of inputs as follows: 
•
Level 1 — Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; 
•
Level 2 — Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 
76
Table of Contents
ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
•
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
 See Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement” for more information.
Non-Controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of equity not attributable to us and are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net loss and comprehensive loss for majority-owned subsidiary are attributed to us and to non-controlling interest holders on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss based on respective ownership percentage.
Variable Interest Entity
We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we hold an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a VIE. We consolidate a VIE’s balance sheet and results of operations into the consolidated financials when we are the primary beneficiary that meets both of the following criteria: (1) we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and (2) we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
We continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE for the consolidation analysis. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interest in accordance with applicable GAAP. Please refer to Note 16 “Variable Interest Entity” for more details. 
We will reconsider whether an entity is still a VIE if certain reconsideration events occur as defined in the ASC 810, 
Consolidation,
 issued by the FASB.

Foreign Currency Transactions
The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar (“USD”), except for the acquired Routejade, which is in Korean Won. Monetary assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currency are remeasured into USD at period-end exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in the foreign currency are remeasured into USD at the historical rates. Foreign transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency and remeasurement of foreign currency accounts are reflected in Other income (expense), net of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we recorded an immaterial amount of net foreign transaction losses in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Routejade utilizes Korean Won as its functional currency. The assets and liabilities of this subsidiary is translated at period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates in effect for the period. The related translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income or loss within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in checking, savings, and money market accounts at financial institutions. Amounts held in these accounts may exceed federally insured limits.
 As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not experience any losses on such deposits. 
For the fiscal year 2024, we have three customers, who had revenues greater than 10% of the total revenues. Customer D, Customer E and Customer G had accounted for approximately 
50
%, 
20
%, and 
10
% of our total revenues, respectively. For the fiscal year 2023, Customer D, which had revenues greater than 10% of the total revenues, had

81
% and 
14
%, respectively, of our total revenue.
As of December 29, 2024, we had three customers, which had accounts receivable greater than 10% of our total accounts receivables. Customer D, E, and G accounted for 
54

Revenue Recognition
In June 2022, we began to generate revenue from the planned principal business activities. We recognize revenue within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”)
. 
The core principle of ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. 
The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
1.
Identify the contract with the customer;
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3.
Determine the transaction price;
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation.
Our revenue consists of product revenue, resulting from the sale of lithium-ion batteries and battery pack products (“Product Revenue”), and service revenue, resulting from payments received from our customers based on executed engineering revenue contracts for the development of lithium-ion battery technology (“Service Revenue”). 
Product Revenue
Product Revenue mainly relates to sales of lithium-ion batteries or battery packs. We recognize Product Revenue at a point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied upon transfer of control of goods, which is upon product shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, depending on the specific contract terms. For certain customized products with customer acceptance criteria specified in the contract, the performance obligation is satisfied upon our customer’s formal acceptance. For the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had $
23.1
 million and $
7.6
 million of Product Revenue, respectively. We had an immaterial amount of Product Revenue for the fiscal year 2022.
Service Revenue
Service Revenue contracts generally include the design and development efforts to conform our existing battery technology with the customer’s required specifications. The term of the Service Revenue contracts generally last from 
one
 to 
three years
 beginning at the effective date of the contract with a single performance obligation. Generally, we own all intellectual property that is developed and directed toward our lithium-ion battery technology. Accordingly, the customer will only receive prototype units of our battery technology as well as any design reports that are submitted to them as part of the contract. Prototype units that are delivered throughout the term of the contract provide marginal value to the customers as they are contractually limited in their ability to derive benefit from the prototype units should the contract be terminated. We conclude that the performance obligation is the delivery of final prototype units, which meet the ultimate specifications set forth by the customer. We did not have Service Revenue for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023 while we had $
6.2
 million for the fiscal year 2022.

Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue represents situations where the cash is collected, but the related revenue has not yet been recognized. Revenue is subsequently recognized when the revenue recognition criteria are met.

As of December 29, 2024, we currently expect to recognize approximately 
49
% of deferred revenue as revenue within the next 
twelve months
 and the remaining amount is expected to be recognized as revenues in 2026.
Costs to Fulfill a Customer Contract
The revenue recognition standard requires capitalization of certain costs to fulfill a customer contract, such as certain employee compensation for design and development services that specifically relate to customer contracts. Costs are recognized as an asset if they relate directly to a customer contract, generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. If these three criteria are not met, the costs are expensed in the period incurred. Deferred costs are recognized as cost of revenue in the period when the related revenue is recognized. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total deferred contract costs were $
0.8
 million for each period.

Product Warranties
We provide product warranties, which cover certain repair or replacement under the revenue contracts and they generally range from 
one
 to 
four years
. Estimated costs related to warranties are recorded in the same period when the product sales occur. The warranty liability reflects management’s best estimates of such costs and are recognized as cost of revenue. We
 continuously monitor our product returns for warranty failures and maintains a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on various factors, including historical product failure rates, results of accelerated lab testing, field monitoring, vendor reliability estimates, and data on industry averages for similar products. Due to the potential for variability in these underlying factors, the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs could be material to our consolidated financial statements. If actual product failure rates or the frequency or severity of reported claims differ from the estimates, we may be required to revise our estimated warranty liability.
 As of 
December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our warranty liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was immaterial.
Sales and Transaction Taxes
Sales and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions are reported on a net basis and are therefore excluded from revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues includes materials, labor, depreciation expense, and other direct costs related to product production and Service Revenue contracts. Labor consists of personnel-related expenses such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. Other direct costs include costs incurred on certain Service Revenue contracts that was in excess of the amount expected to be recovered and other overhead costs in connection with the product production.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist of engineering services, depreciation, development expenses, materials, labor and stock-based compensation and allocated facilities costs, related primarily to our (i) technology development, 
79
Table of Contents
ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(ii) design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models, and (iii) certain costs related to the design, construction, and operation of the pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible to us for commercial production. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, marketing expenses, allocated facilities expenses, depreciation expenses, travel, and professional services expenses, including legal, human resources, information technology, audit, accounting and tax-related services. Personnel related costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Facilities costs consist of rent and maintenance of facilities.
Government Grant
In September 2020, we entered into a financial assistance agreement totaling $
6.5
 million with the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (“EERE”), an office within the U.S. Department of Energy. Under the agreement, we will perform research and development under a joint project with the EERE, and the EERE will reimburse us for approximately 
49.8
% of allowable project costs. The remaining approximately 
50.2
% in costs would be incurred by us. We account for the reimbursable amount, which are probable of being received in the same period in which the costs were incurred as an offset to the related expense (Research and development) or capitalized asset (Property and equipment, net).
 As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an 
immaterial
 reimbursement receivable from the assistance agreement, which is included in 
prepaid expenses and other current assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes,
 issued by FASB. Under the asset and liability method specified by ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
In addition, ASC 740 provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition and measurement of tax positions in previously filed tax returns or positions expected to be taken in future tax returns. The benefit from an uncertain tax position must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties expense, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.

Stock-Based Compensation 
We issue stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). Since the fiscal year 2022, we have not issued stock options.
Restricted Stock Units
Starting in the fiscal year 2021, we began to grant RSUs to our employees and non-employees and these RSUs generally have a service vesting condition over 
four
 or 
five years
. We use our common stock price, which is the closing stock price on the grant date to value our RSUs. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution method. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. 
Performance Restricted Stock Units
Starting in the fiscal year 2022, we began to grant PRSUs to certain employees with vesting conditions based on performance and service conditions over 
two years
. We use our common stock price, which is the closing stock price on the grant date to value our PRSUs. We use the graded vesting method to calculate the stock-based compensation 
80
Table of Contents
ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
expense. At each reporting period, we would recognize and adjust the stock-based compensation expense based on the probability assessment in meeting our PRSUs' performance conditions. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We began to offer the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) to our employees in the fiscal year 2021. We use the Black-Scholes valuation method to value the fair value of ESPP shares and use the graded vesting method to calculate the stock-based compensation expense. 
Stock options
Generally, the stock options have a maximum contractual term up to 
10
 years. The fair value of stock options is based on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes valuation method. The awards are accounted for by recognizing the fair value of the related award over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award (referred to as the requisite service period, which typically equals the vesting period of the award). The vesting period is generally 
four
 or 
five years
. No stock options have been issued with a market condition or other performance vesting condition. In accordance with ASU 2018-07, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation
 (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, the measurement of equity-classified non-employee awards is fixed at the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution method. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. For the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we did 
not
 grant any stock options and, for the fiscal year 2022, we granted less than 
60,000
 shares.
The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for the fair value of stock options per share.
•
Expected Term — The expected term of the options represents the average period the share options are expected to remain outstanding. As we did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior, the expected term of options granted is derived from the average midpoint between the weighted average vesting and the contractual term, also known as the simplified method. We used the simplified calculation of the expected life, which takes into consideration the grant’s contractual life and vesting period and assumes that all options will be exercised between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option. 
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate — The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury notes as of the grant date with terms commensurate with the expected term of the option.
•
Dividend Yield — The expected dividends assumption is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future, as well as we did not pay any dividends in the past.
•
Expected volatility — Prior to July 14, 2021, we were a private company and did not have any trading history for our ordinary shares, the expected volatility was based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies with comparable characteristics, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of our stock options.

Net Loss per Share of Common Stock
Basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated using the two-class method under which earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities. We consider participating securities including outstanding stock options, outstanding RSUs, estimated ESPP shares and convertible senior notes. Unvested early exercised stock options which are subject to repurchase by us are not considered participating securities as those shares do not have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net loss is attributed to common stockholders and participating securities based on their participation rights.
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Unvested early exercised stock options are not considered outstanding for purposes of the weighted average outstanding share calculation until they vest. 
81
Table of Contents
ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) attributable to common stockholders adjusts basic EPS for the potentially dilutive impact of the participating securities. As we reported losses for the periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities including convertible senior notes, stock options and warrants, are generally antidilutive and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share, except when there were changes in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants recorded in earnings. With changes in fair value recorded in earnings, an adjustment would be made to both the diluted EPS numerator and denominator to eliminate such effects.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,
 which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard for our fiscal year 2024 annual financial statements and interim financial statements thereafter. The adoption of 2023-07 did not change the way that we identify our reportable segment and, as a result, did not have a material impact on our segment-related disclosures. See Note 18 “Segment and Geographic Information” for more information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
which expanded the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this ASU on our financial statement disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of certain costs and expenses on an interim and annual basis in the notes to the financial statements. The standard is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this ASU on our financial statement disclosures.

Business Combinations
On September 18, 2023, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Rene Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of South Korea (the “Seller”). On October 31, 2023, we closed the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”) to purchase Routejade, Inc. (“Routejade”), a battery manufacturer incorporated under the laws of South Korea. This acquisition allowed us to vertically integrate electrode coating and battery pack manufacturing, as well as expanded our battery offerings to include conventional graphite battery technology to service the IoT, industrial, aviation, and defense markets.
The total purchase consideration of such transaction consists of cash consideration in the amount of $
15.4
 million, net of acquisition-related seller expense, and 
5,923,521
 shares of our common stock, par value $
0.0001

The gross amount of the acquired accounts and notes receivable was $
1.9
 million, of which an immaterial amount was expected to be uncollectible.
(2)
The fair value of non-controlling interest was measured based on the fair values of net assets acquired at the acquisition date and the price for the equity shares and the portion of ownership not held by the acquirer.
Goodwill
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the expected synergies from future expected economic benefits, including integrating electrode coating and battery pack manufacturing. Goodwill from this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition Costs
For the fiscal year 2023, we recorded approximately $
1.3
 million of acquisition costs, which were included Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 We did not incur acquisition costs in fiscal year 2024.
Proforma information

21.1
 million and $
16.4
 million, respectively. The consolidated unaudited proforma net income related to this acquisition was not included because the impact on the consolidated results of operations was not material.

Note 4. 
Fair Value Measurement
The fair value of our financial assets and liabilities are determined in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements,
 issued by the FASB. The fair value hierarchy of ASC 820 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value and classifies those inputs into three levels:
Level 1:
Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2:
Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, short-term and long-term debt, and warrant liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents are reported at their respective fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values of accounts and notes receivables, accounts payable, short-term debt and accrued liabilities approximated the fair value based on the short maturity of those instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents are reported at their respective fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. We classify money market funds as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs obtained from various third-party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Where applicable the market approach utilizes prices and information from market transactions for similar or identical assets. We will classify commercial paper, corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities as Level 2. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $
272.9
 million and $
233.1
 million, respectively.
The following table details the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the following three-tiered fair value hierarchy per ASC 820,

Convertible Senior Notes
On April 20, 2023, we issued $
172.5
 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 20, 2023 (the “Indenture”), between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The offerings and sale of the Convertible Senior Notes were made by us to the initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for resale by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in the Securities Act) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The issuance included the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional $
22.5
 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes. $
10.0
 million principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes (the “Affiliate Notes”) were issued to an entity affiliated with Thurman John Rodgers, Chairman of our Board of Directors, in a concurrent private placement.
The Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 
3.0
% per year from April 20, 2023, and will be payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2023. The Convertible Senior Notes will mature on May 1, 2028 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.
The net proceeds from the offerings were approximately $
166.6
 million. We used approximately $
17.3
 million of the net proceeds from the offerings to pay the cost of the capped call transactions entered on April 20, 2023 in connection with the offerings. We use a portion of the net proceeds to build out Fab2 in Malaysia and fund our working capital.
The conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes will initially be 64.0800 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $
15.61
 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

We may not redeem the Convertible Senior Notes prior to May 6, 2026. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Senior Notes, at its option, on or after May 6, 2026, if the liquidity condition is satisfied and the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we redeem less than all the outstanding notes, at least $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of, and after giving effect to, delivery of the relevant redemption notice. 
If we undergo a “fundamental change,” as defined in the Indenture, fundamental change permits the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to require us to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions as defined in the Indenture. Holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes in principal amounts of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The fundamental change repurchase price will be equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we accounted for the Convertible Senior Notes as liability instruments and considered it as single units of account pursuant to the Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, 
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)
,

(“ASU 2020-06”). Accrued interest for the Convertible Senior Notes was recorded as Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. To the extent that the debt is outstanding, the debt issuance costs were recorded as a reduction to Long-term debt, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the fiscal year 2023, we incurred approximately $
5.9
 million of debt issuance costs relating to the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes.
Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the issuance of the 
Convertible Senior Notes
, we paid approximately $
17.3
 million to enter into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “Capped Calls”) in the second quarter of 2023. The Capped Calls are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 
Convertible Senior Notes
 and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of

the converted 
Convertible Senior Notes
, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on a cap price initially equal to $
21.17
 per share (which represents a premium of 
56.0
% over the last reported sale price of our common stock of $
13.57
 per share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 17, 2023), and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. We recorded the Capped Calls as a reduction of stockholders' equity, not as derivatives, as the Capped Calls met certain accounting criteria. No subsequent remeasurement is required.

Performance Obligations
As of December 29, 2024, we had $
7.4
 million of performance obligations, which comprised of total deferred revenue and customer order deposits. We currently expect to recognize approximately 
49
% of deferred revenue as revenue within the next 
twelve months
 and the remaining amount is expected to be recognized as revenues in 2026.
Litigation
From time to time, we are subject to a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with our business activities, including product liability, intellectual property, commercial, insurance, securities laws, contract disputes, and employment matters. Certain of these lawsuits and claims are described in further detail below. We intend to vigorously defend against each of these allegations.
A liability and related charge to earnings is recorded in the consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to each case. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to uncertainties. While there can be no assurance of favorable outcome of these legal matters, we currently believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
Former Employee Class Action Lawsuits
On January 21, 2022, 
two
 former machine operator employees filed a putative wage and hour class action lawsuit against Enovix and co-defendant Legendary Staffing, Inc. in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda. The case is captioned 
Sopheak Prak & Ricardo Pimentel v Enovix Corporation and Legendary Staffing, Inc.
, 22CV005846 (the “Prak Complaint”). The Prak Complaint alleged, among other things, on a putative class-wide basis, that the defendants failed to pay all overtime wages and committed meal period, rest period and wage statement violations under the California Labor Code and applicable Wage Orders. The plaintiffs sought unpaid wages, statutory penalties and interest and reasonable costs and attorney fees. We began the mediation process in September 2022 and on June 6, 2024, a final settlement was approved by the court. All settlement funds were distributed in July 2024. 
Legendary Staffing, our co-defendant in the Prak Complaint, filed a breach of contract action against us relating to the alleged failure to make payments on invoices relating to the Prak Complaint. On August 6, 2024, the court dismissed the breach of contact action against us and on November 25, 2024, a default judgment was entered against Legendary in this action. 
In 2023, a former employee filed 
two
 complaints against Enovix. The first complaint asserted a putative class action, alleging various wage and hour violations, and individual claims alleging constructive discharge and adverse employment actions. The second complaint asserted claims under California’s Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) for alleged wage and hour violations. The cases are captioned 
Kody Walker v. Enovix Corporation
, 23CV028923 and 23CV039290 (the “Walker Complaints”). The Walker Complaints were consolidated in April 2024. In November 2024, the parties entered into settlement agreements resolving the individual and PAGA claims, and plaintiff dismissed without prejudice the putative class action claims. Plaintiff filed a motion seeking court approval of the PAGA settlement, which hearing is scheduled for March 2025.
Securities Class Action Complaint
On January 6, 2023, a purported Company stockholder filed a securities class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Enovix and certain of our current and former officers and directors (collectively, the “defendants”). The case is captioned 
Twitchell v. Enovix Corp
., Case No. 23-cv-00071-SI (N.D. Cal.) (“Twitchell”). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making material misstatements or omissions in public statements related to our manufacturing scale-ups and testing of new equipment. A substantially identical complaint was filed on January 25, 2023 by another purported Company stockholder. Following consolidation of the cases and court appointment of 
two
 purported Company stockholder lead plaintiffs, a consolidated complaint alleging substantially similar claims, including allegations that the defendants made material misstatements or omissions in public statements related to testing of new equipment, was filed on July 7, 2023.

ENOVIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The court granted the motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on January 30, 2024. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 19, 2024, which seeks unspecified damages, interest, fees and costs on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased and/or acquired shares of Enovix or its predecessor entity’s common stock between June 24, 2021 and October 3, 2023. On July 23, 2024, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. We and the defendants are defending against the remaining claims in this action.
In September 2024, we received 
two
 Section 220 book and records demand notices from 
two
 separate shareholders related to the securities class action complaint, which may result in separately filed lawsuits in Delaware. On November 21, 2024, a new derivative lawsuit was filed in Alameda County against us, which lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of the 
Twitchell
 matter.
Guarantees and Indemnifications 
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. In addition, we purchased performance bonds for guarantee of our performance obligations for certain projects. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to the indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. 
We also have indemnification obligations to our officers and directors for specified events or occurrences, subject to some limits, while they are serving at our request in such capacities. There have been no claims to date and we have director and officer insurance that may enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future potential claims. We believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these obligations for the periods presented.

1.0
 billion of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants in one or more offerings. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we sold 
11,626,089
 shares of our common stock and received proceeds of $
106.7
 million, net of estimated issuance costs.
At-Market Equity Offering

Warrants 
Private Placement Warrants
The 
6,000,000
 Private Placement Warrants were originally issued in a private placement to the initial stockholder of the Sponsor in connection with the initial public offering. Each whole Private Placement Warrant became exercisable for 
one
 whole share of our common stock at a price of $
11.50
 per share on December 5, 2021. 
The Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and will not be redeemable by us, in each case so long as they are still held by the initial purchasers or their affiliates. The Private Placement Warrants purchased by the Sponsor will not be exercisable more than 
five years
 from the effective date of the RSVAC IPO registration statement, in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(G)(i), as long as Rodgers Capital, LLC or any of its related persons beneficially own these Private Placement Warrants. On September 8, 2021, the Sponsor made an in-kind distribution of the Private Placement Warrants to certain members of Rodgers Capital LLC. The Private Placement Warrants are classified as liability.
During the third quarter of 2024, there was a cashless exercise of 
500,000
 shares of the Private Placement Warrants with an exercise price of $
11.50
 per share and we issued 
153,822
 shares of our common stock. As of December 29, 2024, the remaining contractual term for the outstanding Private Placement Warrants to purchase our common stock is approximately 
1.5
 years. 
As of December 29, 2024, we had 
5,500,000
 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. See Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement” for more information.
Note 13. 
Net Loss per Share
We compute net earnings per share (“EPS”) of common stock using the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed using net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using net income (loss) with an adjustment of changes in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants recorded in earnings divided by the total of weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding and any dilutive potential common stock shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common stock shares included the assumed stock options exercises, vesting and issuance activities of restricted stock units and estimated common stock issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.
The following table shows the computation of the basic and diluted net EPS of common stock for the periods presented below (in thousands, except share and per share amount).

Stock-based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
As of December 29, 2024, our equity compensation plans include the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”). 
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2021 Plan was approved by our stockholders in July 2021. The 2021 Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”). Under the 2021 Plan, our employees, directors and consultants (“Participants”), are eligible for grants of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), collectively referred to as “Stock Awards”. Incentive stock and non-statutory stock options are collectively referred to as “Option(s).”
Under the 2021 Plan, 
16,850,000
 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st each year, starting on January 1,

% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31st of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (b) a lesser number determined by our board of directors prior to the applicable January 1st. 
2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2021 ESPP was adopted by our board of directors in June 2021 and approved by our stockholders in July 2021. Under the 2021 ESPP, 
5,625,000
 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st each year, starting on January 1, 2022 and continuing through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (a)

2,000,000
 shares of the Registrant’s common stock or (c) a lesser number determined by our board of directors. 
The 2021 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 
15
% discount through periodic payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of base compensation, subject to individual purchase limits in any single purchase date or in one calendar year. The 2021 ESPP provides 
18-month
 offering periods with 
three

6-month
 purchase periods. A new 
18-month
 offering period will commence every 
six months
 thereafter. The purchase price for our common stock under the ESPP is

Stock-Based Compensation
We issue equity awards to our employees and non-employees in the form of stock options, RSUs and PRSUs. Additionally, we also offer the 2021 ESPP to our eligible employees. We use Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock options granted and the estimated shares to be purchased under the ESPP. For both RSUs and PRSUs, we use our common stock price, which is the last reported sales price on the grant date to value those securities.
In general, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and records forfeitures as they occur. For PRSUs, we use the graded vesting method to calculate stock-based compensation expense. At each reporting period, we would recognize and adjust stock-based compensation expense based on the probability assessment in meeting PRSUs' performance conditions.

    During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we engaged a consulting company for its services and issued RSUs in exchange for its services. In connection with this service agreement, we recorded approximately $
9.6
 million of stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2024.
For the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we capitalized $
3.6
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation as property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we accrued $
2.7
 million of bonus to be settled in equity awards as accrued compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2024.
There was an 
immaterial
 amount of tax benefit recognized related to stock-based compensation for fiscal year 2024 and 
no
 recognized tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022. In addition, there was 
no
 recognized tax benefit from the stock options exercised for the periods presented. 
As of December 29, 2024, there was approximately $
105.2
 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested equity awards, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
3.1
 years. As of December 29, 2024, there was approximately $
0.8
 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to the 2021 ESPP, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining period of 
1.4
 years.
Equity Award Modification
In connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan (as defined in Note 15 “Restructuring Costs”), there were few equity award modifications in the fiscal year 2024, which modified the terms of the awards. For the fiscal year 2024, we recognized $
1.3
 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the modifications.
During the fiscal year 2023, in connection with the retirement or resignation of several of our former officers and executives, the change in employment status impacted the vesting conditions as the term of equity award exercise period was extended and certain of the equity awards were accelerated and vested immediately. For the fiscal year 2023, we recognized $
21.1
 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the modifications. There was 
no
 equity modification for the fiscal year 2022.
Stock Option Activity
Options granted under the 2021 Plan and the 2016 Plan to employees generally have a service vesting condition over 
four
 or 
five years
. Other vesting terms are permitted and are determined by our board of directors. Options have a term of no more than 
ten years
 from the date of grant and vested options are generally cancelled 
three months
 after termination of employment if unexercised.

Early Exercise of Options
The terms of the 2016 Plan and the 2021 Plan permit the exercise of options granted prior to vesting, subject to required approvals. The unvested shares are subject to our repurchase right, upon termination of employment, at the lower of (i) the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of repurchase or (ii) their original exercise price. The repurchase right lapses 
90
 days after the termination of the employee’s employment. Shares purchased by employees pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are not deemed, for accounting purposes, to be issued until those shares vest according to their respective vesting schedules. Cash received for early exercised stock options is recorded as other current and non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is reclassified to common stock and additional paid in capital as such shares vest. 
Unvested early exercised stock options which are subject to repurchase by us are not considered participating securities as those shares do not have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Unvested early exercised stock options are not considered outstanding for purposes of the weighted average outstanding share calculation until they vest.
As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
23,886
 and 
470,544
 shares, respectively, remained subject to our right of repurchase as a result of early exercised stock options. The remaining liability related to early exercised shares as

of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were immaterial. The early exercised stock options liability was recorded in other current and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Issuance of Common Stock Subject to Return
In connection with certain early exercised stock options, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we erroneously issued an additional 
1,304,954
 shares of common stock to several former executive officers as a result of an administrative issue. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we received a full recovery of these common stock shares from the former executive officers. For their cooperation in returning the additional shares to us, we issued a total of 
130,000
 shares of fully vested RSUs to them.
Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Restricted Stock Unit Activities
Since September 2021, we primarily grant RSUs to our employees and non-employee directors. We generally grant RSUs with service vesting condition over 
four
 or 
five years
. In addition, in the fiscal year 2022, we began to grant PRSUs to certain employees with both performance and service vesting conditions over 
two years
. Each RSU or PRSU is not considered issued and outstanding and does not have voting rights until it is converted into 
one
 share of our common stock upon vesting.

Restructuring Costs
2024 Restructuring Plan
In May 2024, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) designed to reduce operating costs and support our strategic goals. As part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we relocated our manufacturing operations from our Fab1 facility in Fremont, California to Malaysia, resulting in a plan of workforce reduction in the U.S, as well as long-lived asset disposals related to Fab1. The 2024 Restructuring Plan was substantially complete in 2024.
In connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recorded estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of $
41.8
 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024. These restructuring costs were reflected in Restructuring cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The restructuring costs for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024 included non-cash charges of $
38.2
 million of loss on disposals of Fab1 long-lived asset in Fremont, California, $
1.2
 million of stock-based compensation expense, cash charges of $
1.6
 million of severance and termination benefits and $
0.8
 million of other charges.
During the fiscal year 2024, we paid $
2.0
 million of cash costs related to the restructuring costs. As of December 29, 2024, we had $
0.4
 million of the restructuring liability, which was included in Other current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
2023 Restructuring Plan
On October 3, 2023, we announced a strategic realignment (the “2023 Restructuring Plan”) of our first production line (“Fab1”) in Fremont designed to refocus the facility from a manufacturing hub to our “Center for Innovation,” focused on new product development, including a plan of workforce reduction.
In connection with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, we recorded approximately $
3.0
 million of restructuring costs for the fiscal year 2023, which consisted of severance, termination benefits, stock-based compensation expense and inventory costs. These restructuring costs were reflected in Restructuring cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we paid $
1.6
 million of the restructuring costs and the remaining $
0.4
 million of the restructuring liability was included in Accrued compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. 
In addition, we recognized an accelerated depreciation expenses of approximately $
18.5
 million for Gen1 equipment in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $
18.4
 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2024.

Variable Interest Entity
We consolidate a VIE when we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE, which could potentially be significant to the VIE, and, as a result, are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 
YBS Agreement
On July 26, 2023, we entered into a manufacturing agreement (the “YBS Agreement”) with YBS International Berhad (“YBS”), a Malaysia-based investment holding company with segments including electronic manufacturing and assembly, high-precision engineering, precision machining and stamping, among others. We have the sole and exclusive rights to YBS’s output of products with our proprietary technology. The term of the YBS Agreement is 
ten years
, with an automatic 
five year
 extension. As a part of the YBS Agreement, YBS assigned Orifast Solution Sdn Bhd (“OSSB”), its subsidiary, to manufacture lithium-ion batteries for us under the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 
Pursuant to the terms of the initial Agreement, Enovix and YBS agreed to share responsibility for the second generation (“Gen2”) Line 1 equipment and facilitization costs, with Enovix contributing 
30
% of the initial investment and YBS obligated to finance the remaining 
70
%. 
As of December 31, 2023, we concluded that OSSB was considered a VIE (the “OSSB VIE”) and we were the primary beneficiary of OSSB based on relevant accounting guidance. We had a variable interest in OSSB with no equity investment in OSSB. Accordingly, we consolidated OSSB financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2023, the total assets and liabilities of OSSB were immaterial. 
YBS Agreement Amendment
On October 29, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the YBS Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, Enovix is responsible for the initial investment of $
100.0
 million for the Gen2 Line 1 equipment and facilitization costs at 
100
% instead of 
30
%, and YBS is responsible for obtaining and managing its working capital requirements to fulfill its obligations to provide manufacturing services, including direct and indirect materials, direct labor utilities and repair and maintenance. Additionally, YBS is obligated to purchase the tooling and fixtures for manufacturing of the products as designed by us, pursuant to the Amendment. 
Pricing under the YBS Agreement is set on a cost-plus basis and we are subject to a minimum commitment, as such term was modified by the Amendment. The YBS Agreement has an initial 
ten-year
 term with eight years and seven months remaining as of December 2024, which will automatically renew for one successive 
five-year
 period unless earlier terminated. There was no change to the remaining life of the contract or the renewal term under the Amendment.
Pursuant to the Amendment, YBS replaced OSSB and became a named entity in this modified arrangement. As such, we no longer have a relationship with OSSB, which is no longer a variable interest entity, and no consolidation evaluation is required. Accordingly, OSSB was deconsolidated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the effect of the deconsolidation on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial.
As a result of the Amendment, YBS is the named entity under the Amendment and we reassessed our relationship with YBS. We concluded that we did not have a controlling financial interest in YBS, as defined in ASC 810, 
Consolidation
, as of December 29, 2024 due to the fact that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of YBS and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of YBS. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary of YBS and are not required to consolidate YBS.

As of December 29, 2024, we had $
703.7
 million of state loss carryovers, $
541.4
 million of federal loss carryovers, and $
5.4
 million of foreign loss carryovers that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax-effected loss carryovers were $
62.2
 million for state before federal effect, $
113.7
 million for federal and $
1.4
 million for foreign as of December 29, 2024. We also had $
16.8
 million of state research and development (“R&D”) tax credit carryovers, $
18.0
 million of federal R&D tax credit carryovers and $
0.5
 million of foreign R&D tax credit carryovers as of December 29, 2024.
The state losses expire between 2028 and 2044. Approximately $
127.9
 million of the federal losses expire between 2026 and 2037 and $
413.6
 million of the remainder do not expire. The foreign losses expire between 2037 and 2039. The federal credit carryovers expire between 2027 and 2044. The state credit carryovers do not expire. The foreign credit carryovers expire by 2030. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are subject to certain limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, due to historical changes in our ownership, as defined in current income tax regulations. A portion of the carryforwards will expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.
Valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Significant judgement is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
As of December 29, 2024, we recognized a full valuation allowance against the U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets, including operating loss carryovers and credit carryovers. We evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, which existed as of December 29, 2024. Our conclusion to maintain a full valuation allowance against the U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets was based upon the assessment of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in future periods.

As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
none
 of the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods if recognized, since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently offset by a full valuation allowance.
As of December 29, 2024, we have 
not
 identified any unrecognized that benefits where it is reasonably possible that we will recognize a decrease within the next 12 months. If we do recognize such a decrease, the net impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations would not be material.
For the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
no
 interest expense was recognized relating to income tax liabilities. There were 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to income tax liabilities as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in the California and Florida state jurisdiction. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the U.S. We are also subject to income taxes in several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under examination by any taxing authority.
As of December 29, 2024, we maintain our prior indefinite reinvestment assertion on undistributed earnings related to foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation as those earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested. If the earnings were to be distributed, the tax liability associated with these indefinitely reinvested earnings would be immaterial. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to indefinitely reinvested income.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who for the period covered by this report is serving as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer) and our Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on the evaluation as described above, our Chief Executive Officer (who for the period covered by this report is serving as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer) and our Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms as of December 29, 2024. For the purpose of this review, disclosure controls and procedures means controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who for the period covered by this report is serving as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer) and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. 
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 based on criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 29, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective
. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We completed the integration of Routejade, which was acquired in the fiscal year 2023, into our operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. Other than the integration of Routejade into our internal control over financial reporting, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal year ended December 29, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who for the period covered by this report is serving as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer) and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,

and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
