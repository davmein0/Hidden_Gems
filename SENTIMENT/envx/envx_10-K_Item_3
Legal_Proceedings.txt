Table of Contents
The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements, and the assumptions underlying such statements, involve a number of risks, uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and include, but are not limited to, those summarized on the following page. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. Importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties summarized in this risk factor summary, as well as other risks and uncertainties that we face, can be found under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K below.
•
We will need to improve our energy density, cycle life, fast charging, capacity roll off and gassing metrics in order to stay ahead of competition over time, which is difficult and we may not be able to do.
•
We rely on a new and complex manufacturing process for our operations, and achieving volume production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance such as yield and costs.
•
If we cannot successfully scale our
 manufacturing facilities to produce our lithium-ion battery cell in sufficient quantities to meet expected demand, improve productivity and bring additional facilities online, we may be unable to achieve our profitability targets and our business will be negatively impacted and could fail.
•
We rely on a manufacturing agreement with a Malaysia-based company for some of the facilities, procurement, and personnel needs of our operations. Changes to our relationship with such third-party contract manufacturer, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.
•
Our operations in international markets, including our manufacturing operations, expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks, as well as risks relating to geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations.
•
We may not be able to source or establish supply relationships for necessary components and raw materials, or may be required to pay costs for components and raw materials that are more expensive than anticipated, including as a result of trade barriers, trade sanctions, export restrictions, tariffs, embargoes or shortages and other general economic and political conditions, which could delay the introduction of our product and negatively impact our business.
•
We may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations and the components necessary to build our lithium-ion battery cells.
•
Lengthy sales cycles, unpredictable safety risks and certain provisions of defense and other customer contracts may negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow our customer base, which could adversely affect our business and future prospects. 
•
If our batteries fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our batteries could be harmed.
•
We have a concentration of customer accounts in the defense sector and dependence on these customer accounts may create a risk to our financial stability.
•
Our future growth and success depend on our ability to qualify new customers and the customer qualification cycles can take years to complete.
•
We may not be able to accurately estimate the future supply and demand for our batteries, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays.
•
We have a history of financial losses and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future.
•
If we are unable to develop our business and effectively commercialize our products as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenue or achieve profitability.
•
We face significant barriers in our attempts to produce our products, our products are still under development, and we may not be able to successfully develop our products at commercial scale. If we cannot successfully overcome those barriers, our business will be negatively impacted and could fail.
•
We have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, and dilute stockholder value.

•
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
•
Operational problems with our manufacturing equipment subject us to safety risks which, if not adequately addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or prospects.
•
The battery market continues to evolve and is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry or establishing and maintaining confidence in our long-term business prospects among current and future partners and customers.
•
Our failure to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our batteries to become less marketable or obsolete, resulting in a decrease in demand for our batteries and harm our ability to grow revenue and expand margins.
•
If we are unable to attract and retain key employees and qualified personnel on a global basis, our business and prospects could be harmed.
•
We have previously been, currently are, and may in the future be involved in class-action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming. If resolved adversely, lawsuits and other litigation matters could seriously harm our business.
•
We may not have adequate funds to finance our operating needs and our growth, and may need to raise additional capital, which we may not be able to do.
•
Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.
•
We rely heavily on our intellectual property portfolio. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position would be harmed.
•
The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.
•
Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.
