Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage neuromuscular disease company focused on discovering and advancing innovative life-transforming therapeutics for people living with genetically driven neuromuscular diseases. Leveraging the modularity of our FORCE platform, we are developing targeted therapeutics that are designed to overcome limitations in delivery to muscle tissue and the central nervous system, or CNS. Our proprietary FORCE platform therapeutics consist of a payload that we rationally design to target the genetic basis of the disease we are seeking to treat, a linker

and an antigen-binding fragment, or Fab, that we attach to the payload using the linker. With our FORCE platform, we have the flexibility to deploy different classes of payloads (such as oligonucleotides and enzymes) with specific mechanisms of action that modify target functions. We leverage this modularity to focus on neuromuscular diseases with high unmet need, with etiologic targets and with clear translational potential from preclinical disease models to well-defined clinical development and regulatory pathways.

Using our FORCE platform, we are assembling a broad portfolio of product candidates, including product candidates being developed for myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, or FSHD, and Pompe disease. In addition, we plan to expand our portfolio through development efforts focused on rare skeletal muscle diseases, as well as cardiac and metabolic muscle diseases, including some with larger patient populations, and diseases involving the CNS. We have identified product candidates for each of our DM1, DMD, FSHD and Pompe programs that are in varying stages of preclinical and clinical development.

Our product candidate DYNE-101 is being evaluated in ACHIEVE, an ongoing Phase 1/2 global clinical trial in patients with DM1. ACHIEVE, which is designed to be a registrational trial, consists of a 24-week multiple ascending dose, or MAD, randomized, placebo-controlled period, a 24-week open-label extension, or OLE, a 96-week long-term extension, and a registrational expansion cohort. In January 2025, we announced the completion of the MAD portion of the trial and our plans to initiate a registrational expansion cohort to support submission for Accelerated Approval in the U.S. We plan to complete enrollment of the registrational expansion cohort in mid-2025 with data from this cohort in the first half of 2026 and potential submission for U.S. Accelerated Approval in the first half of 2026.

Our product candidate DYNE-251 is being evaluated in DELIVER, an ongoing Phase 1/2 global clinical trial in patients with DMD who have mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. DELIVER, which is designed to be a registrational trial, consists of a 24-week MAD, randomized, placebo-controlled period, a 24-week OLE, a 192-week long-term extension, and a registrational expansion cohort. In September 2024, we announced the completion of the MAD portion of the trial, and in November 2024 we announced the initiation of the registrational expansion cohort to support submission for Accelerated Approval in the U.S. We plan to complete enrollment of the registrational expansion cohort in the first quarter of 2025 with data from this cohort in late 2025 and potential submission for U.S. Accelerated Approval in early 2026.

We were incorporated and commenced operations in 2017. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting research and development activities and filing and prosecuting

125

patent applications. We do not have any products for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise. To date, we have principally raised capital through sales of equity securities.

Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we reported net losses of $317.4 million, $235.9 million and $168.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $949.9 million.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our expenses and capital expenditure requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:

•
advance our product candidates for DM1, DMD, FSHD and Pompe and conduct research programs in additional indications;

•
expand the capabilities of our proprietary FORCE platform; 

•
seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

•
obtain, expand, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; 

•
hire additional clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel; 

•
establish manufacturing sources for any product candidate we may develop, including the Fab antibody, linkers and therapeutic payload that will comprise the product candidate, and secure supply chain capacity to provide sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical development and commercial supply; 

•
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; and 

•
add operational, legal, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research, product development and future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our operations as a public company. 

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we may develop. If we obtain regulatory approval for or otherwise commercialize any product candidates we may develop, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capabilities to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements or arrangements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development or future commercialization of one or more product candidates we may develop.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations at planned levels, and as a result we may be forced to substantially reduce or terminate our operations.

126

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from sales of common stock under our at-the-market offering program during the first quarter of 2025, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2026. We have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. See “—Liquidity and capital resources” below.

Components of our results of operations

Revenue

We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for at least a couple of years, if at all. If our development efforts are successful and we commercialize products, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments from such collaboration or license agreements, or a combination thereof.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities and development of our product candidates. These expenses include:

•
development and operation of our proprietary FORCE platform; 

•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

•
expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and development of our product candidates, including those incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for use in our research, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including those incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs; 

•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and 

•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

Our direct external research and development expenses consist of costs that include fees, reimbursed materials and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our development, manufacturing and clinical activities. We have not allocated our direct external research and development costs to specific programs or product candidates that are not in clinical development.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we advance DYNE-101 and DYNE-251 through clinical trials, in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities of DYNE-302, our FSHD product candidate, and DYNE-401, our Pompe disease product candidate, and if and as we advance any other product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing

127

and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop. The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the following:

•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

•
the number and scope of programs we decide to pursue and their regulatory paths to market; 

•
the need to raise funding to complete preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop; 

•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements and the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we may enter into such arrangements; 

•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new programs; 

•
the successful initiation, enrollment and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; 

•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates we may develop; 

•
the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of any product candidate we may develop; 

•
establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for supply of product candidate components for our clinical trials; 

•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; 

•
our ability to protect our other rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

•
commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

•
obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved products. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidate we may develop could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate we may develop.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees in executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include allocated expenses for rent, depreciation and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our growth strategy. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate and do not enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities.

Interest income

Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

128

Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net consists of realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities and foreign currency gains and losses.

Income taxes

Since our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $315.7 million and $332.2 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are indefinite lived and the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2024, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $31.2 million and $4.7 million which begin to expire in 2039 and 2033, respectively.

Expenses related to DYNE-101 increased in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This was attributable to higher manufacturing activity in 2024 to produce a

129

sufficient clinical supply of drug product for the ongoing ACHIEVE trial and an increase in clinical trial activity for the ACHIEVE trial. Expenses related to DYNE-251 increased in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This was attributable to higher manufacturing activity in 2024 to produce a sufficient clinical supply of drug product for the ongoing DELIVER trial and an increase in clinical trial activity for the DELIVER trial.

The increase in platform and external research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to increased external research activity associated with our preclinical programs and product candidates. The increase in personnel-related expenses was primarily due to increased headcount in our research and development function. The increase in facility-related and other expenses was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger number of research and development personnel.

The increase in personnel-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to increased headcount in our general and administrative function. The increase in stock-based compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of acceleration of vesting terms and modification of previously granted awards in connection with entering into separation and consulting agreements with our former chief executive officer, former chief business officer and former chief operating officer. Professional and consulting fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the higher consulting costs to support the growth of the organization in 2024. Facility-related and other expenses decreased primarily due to decreased general business expenses, including the cost of corporate insurance policies.

Interest income

Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $26.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, due to interest earned on invested cash balances. The increase in interest income was due to an increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to the public sales of our common stock in the first and second quarters of 2024 on which we are earning interest.

Other expense, net

Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.5 million primarily due to foreign currency gains and losses. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.4 million primarily due to foreign currency gains and losses.

Liquidity and capital resources

Sources of liquidity

Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates and platform. We have not yet commercialized any product candidates, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for at least a couple of years, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $642.3 million.

In November 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, to register for sale from time to time up to $400.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more offerings. Further, in November 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement
SM
, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, and included in the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement a prospectus relating to the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million, which we refer to as our at-the-market offering program. Sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement through Jefferies may be made by any method that is deemed an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or Securities Act. On January 4, 2024, we notified Jefferies that we were suspending and terminating the prospectus filed under our 2021 Shelf Registration Statement relating to the Sales Agreement for our at-the-market offering program.

On March 5, 2024, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement, and included a prospectus relating to the Sales Agreement. Under the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement, we may offer and sell debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, units and/or warrants from time to time at an indeterminate aggregate offering price in one or more offerings. In November 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement relating to the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which, in accordance with the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $300.0 million in our at-the-market offering program.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 3,800,465 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $97.9 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We sold such shares at a weighted average price of $26.86 per share.

In January 2024, we completed a follow-on public offering, which we refer to as the January 2024 offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 19,722,500 shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of $323.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.

In May 2024, we completed a follow-on public offering, which we refer to as the May 2024 offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,075,000 shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of $351.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.

In the first quarter of 2025, we issued and sold 10,660,159 shares of common stock through our at-the-market offering program pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We received net proceeds of $140.6 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by us.

Operating activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $292.4 million of cash, due to our net loss of $317.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $19.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $44.5 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $9.0 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities and a $10.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $188.2 million of cash, due to our net loss of $235.9 million partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $26.3 million and non-cash charges of $21.4 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $23.0 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities and a $3.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during these periods were generally due to the growth of our business, increased clinical trial activity, increased manufacturing activities, advancement of our product candidates, the timing of vendor invoices and payments and annual bonus payments.

Investing activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $204.1 million due to purchases of marketable securities of $317.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $2.4 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $105.2 million and sales of marketable securities of $10.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $83.3 million due to maturities of marketable securities of $126.5 million and sales of marketable securities of $1.8 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $44.3 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.7 million.

Financing activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $809.9 million, consisting of $675.2 million in aggregate net proceeds from sales of common stock in our January 2024 and May 2024 offerings, $97.9 million in aggregate net proceeds from sales under our at-the-market offering program and $36.8 million in proceeds received from stock option exercises.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $54.3 million, consisting of $52.4 million in aggregate net proceeds from sales of common stock under our at-the-market offering program and $1.9 million in proceeds received from stock option exercises.

A discussion of changes in our financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is included under the heading “
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024.

Funding requirements

We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical development of DYNE-101 and DYNE-251, the development of our FSHD and Pompe

132

programs and additional research programs. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:

•
the identification of additional product candidates;

•
the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop;

•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of any product candidates we may develop;

•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;

•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to any product candidates we may develop, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;

•
the cost and timing of obtaining materials to produce adequate product supply for any preclinical or clinical development of any product candidate we may develop;

•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidate we may develop for which we obtain marketing approval;

•
the legal costs involved in prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;

•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;

•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, as well as the costs and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder; and

•
the costs of operating as a public company.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from sales of common stock under our at-the-market offering program during the first quarter of 2025, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements other arrangements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development or future commercialization of one or more of our product candidates we may develop. See Item 1A. “Risk factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

Contractual and other obligations

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are generally cancelable by us upon written

133

notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation and in the case of certain arrangements with CROs and CMOs may include non-cancelable fees.

We have also entered into a license agreement with the University of Mons under which we are obligated to make specified milestone and royalty payments. The payment obligations under this agreement are contingent upon future events, such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, or generating product sales. We are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. For additional information about our license agreement with the University of Mons and amounts that could become payable in the future under that agreement, see Item 1. “Business—Intellectual Property—License Agreement with the University of Mons” in this Annual Report.

On December 4, 2020, we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space, which was amended in January 2021, March 2021, and June 2021. The lease has a term of 8.5 years that commenced when we gained access to the office and laboratory space in September 2021. Our obligation for the payment of the base rent began in April 2022 and is $0.4 million per month, increasing to $0.5 million per month during the term of the lease. We have two options to extend the term of the lease, each for a period of an additional five years.

On January 15, 2025, we entered into a master manufacturing services agreement with a CMO which secures capacity at the CMO’s manufacturing facilities for certain of our product candidates and components thereof. The agreement obligates us to compensate the CMO at least $60 million for producing certain of our product candidates and components thereof through 2026. In specified termination circumstances, the agreement requires us to pay the CMO for services completed, the cost of the CMO’s raw materials that cannot be repurposed and specified cancellation fees. This agreement formalizes and supersedes a letter agreement that we entered into with the CMO on July 18, 2024.

Critical accounting estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. As we advance our product candidates into and through clinical development, we expect research and development expenses and, in particular, our accounting for accrued research and development expenses to be an increasingly important critical accounting policy. We believe the following accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements have the most significant level of estimation uncertainty and have and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

134

Accrued research and development expenses

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our service providers and applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:

•
CROs in connection with the ACHIEVE and DELIVER clinical trials;

•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with research activities; 

•
CMOs in connection with the production of research materials; and

•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. 

We measure the expense recognized based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the achievement of specified milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.

Stock-based compensation

We measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options, and we measure awards of restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the straight-line method to record the expense of awards with service-based vesting conditions. We use the graded-vesting method to record the expense of awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, commencing when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. During 2024, all of our outstanding awards only include time-based vesting conditions.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.

135

Prior to our IPO, there was no public market for our common stock, and consequently, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering third-party valuations of our common stock as well as our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation through the date of the grant. Since our IPO, we have determined the fair market value of our common stock using the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements

Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate market risk as part of our treasury and investment portfolio, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held in readily available checking and money market accounts, as well as debt securities. As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital, provide adequate liquidity and earn returns commensurate with our risk appetite. We invest in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in our investment policy, which also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument. These instruments primarily include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper, certificates of deposit and money market funds. These investments are denominated in U.S. Dollars and none are held for trading purposes.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, changes in interest rates did not have a material impact on our historical financial position, our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. However, there can be no assurance that changes in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on us in the future.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from contracts with vendors located outside of the United States, for which certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We do not have a foreign currency hedging program. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our historical financial position, our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows. Due to the relatively small number of contracts with vendors located outside of the United States and the relative size of those contracts, an immediate 10% change in a foreign currency exchange change would not have a material effect on our historical financial position, our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on us in the future.

Item 8. Financial Statement

The financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8, together with the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President, Head of Finance and Administration (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under

137

the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President, Head of Finance and Administration concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management based its assessment on criteria established in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the stockholders and board of directors of Dyne Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dyne Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Regist
ered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Dyne Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dyne Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accrued and Prepaid Research and Development Expense – Refer to Note 2 and 6 to the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matter Description

F-
2

The Company records accrued expenses and prepaid expenses associated with ongoing research and development costs, including costs associated with outsourced agreements for clinical trials with contract research organizations (CROs) and production of research materials with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Estimates of expenses incurred are determined by analyzing progress of the studies, including phase or completion of events, invoices received, payments made, communication with third-party CROs and CMOs, and internal tracking of work completed to date. Expenses incurred in excess of amounts invoiced are recorded as accrued expenses. Payments made in excess of expenses incurred are recorded as prepaid costs. We note that these balances are included in the “Accrued Expenses” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets”, respectively, in the financial statements. We identified auditing the estimates of the extent of work performed by CROs and CMOs as a critical audit matter because of the level of management judgment required and volume of such estimates made by management. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to accrued and prepaid research and development expenses included the following, among others:

▪
We tested the design and effectiveness of controls over the estimation of accrued and prepaid research and development expenses.

▪
For a sample of studies and clinical trials, we performed the following:

o
Inspected the related contracts, purchase orders, statements of work and other contractual documentation. 

o
Tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to develop the estimates.

o
Performed corroborating inquiries with the Company’s research and development personnel.

o
Inspected information from third-party service providers to understand the nature and progress of the studies. 

o
Obtained corresponding invoices and evidence of payment to third-party service providers.

Dyne Therapeutics, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation

Dyne Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage neuromuscular disease company focused on advancing innovative life-transforming therapeutics for people living with genetically driven neuromuscular diseases. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on 
December 1, 2017
 and has a principal place of business in Waltham, Massachusetts.

The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, risks of failure of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the need to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates, fluctuations in operating results, compliance with government regulations, the ability to establish clinical- and commercial-scale manufacturing processes and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product candidates and programs currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization of a product. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations with proceeds from the sales of equity securities. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

To continue its development efforts, the Company will need to obtain substantial additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements in order to fund its research and development and ongoing operating expenses. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, when needed or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company’s stockholders. Any collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, limit, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, pipeline expansion or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates, which could adversely affect its business prospects. Although management will continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations when needed or at all.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Dyne Therapeutics Securities Corporation. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the

F-
8

authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual of research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, as there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.

Concentrations of credit risk and of significant suppliers
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company believes the depository institutions in which the cash and cash equivalents are held are of high-credit quality. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in money market funds that invest in U.S. treasury securities and highly liquid investments maturing within 90 days from the date of purchase. The Company’s marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities and U.S. treasury notes. The Company has adopted an investment policy that limits the amounts the Company may invest in the securities of any single issuer with the exclusion of the U.S. government. The Company has not experienced any credit losses.

The Company is dependent on a small number of third-party suppliers for its drug substance and drug product. In particular, the Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers for certain materials and components required for the development of its programs and future production of any product candidates it may develop for its programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply process.

Marketable securities
The Company’s marketable securities consist of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury notes and corporate debt securities and are classified as available-for-sale which are reported at fair value. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identification method and are included as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The Company evaluates its marketable securities with unrealized losses for other-than-temporary impairment. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the Company’s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and market conditions in general. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment that the Company considers to be “other than temporary,” the Company reduces the investment to fair value through a charge to the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. No such adjustments were necessary during the periods presented.

Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances presented in the arrangement, including whether the Company controls the use of identified assets. The Company classifies leases with a term greater than

F-

one year as either operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date and records a right-of-use assets and current and non-current lease liabilities, as applicable on the balance sheet. The Company has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less, but payments are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. If a lease includes options to extend the lease term, the Company does not assume the option will be exercised in its initial lease term assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew based on an assessment of economic factors present as of the lease commencement date. The Company monitors its plans to renew its material lease each reporting period.

Lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The present value of future lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in lease contracts if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, the amount of the lease payments in a similar economic environment. After lease commencement and the establishment of a right-to-use asset and operating lease liability, lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company enters into contracts that contain both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include costs that do not provide a right-to-use a leased asset but instead provide a service, such as maintenance costs. The Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together as a single component for all classes of underlying assets. Variable costs associated with the lease, such as maintenance and utilities, are not included in the measurement of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities but rather are expensed when the events determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid have occurred.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset class.

Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction-in-process and depreciated once placed into service. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Impairment of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred. The Company recognizes an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and the fair value of such assets. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges in the periods presented in these financial statements.

Segment information

Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer (“CEO”). The CEO views the Company’s operations and manages the business as 
one
 operating segment.

Research and development costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation and amortization, manufacturing expenses and external costs of vendors engaged to conduct clinical and preclinical development activities as well as the cost of licensing technology.
Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of technology are expensed as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are consumed or the services are performed.

Research and manufacturing contract costs and accruals
The Company has entered into various research and development and manufacturing contracts. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as the corresponding expenses are incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the research studies and manufacturing activities, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.

Patent costs
All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses.

Income taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Fair value measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most

F-
11

advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

•
Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. 
•
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: 
•
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; 
•
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; 
•
observable inputs other than quoted prices that are used in the valuation of the asset or liabilities (e.g., interest rate and yield curve quotes at commonly quoted intervals); and 
•
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the assets or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). 

Net loss per share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss is computed by adjusting net loss to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.

The following potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

Stock-based compensation

The Company accounts for stock option awards at fair value and measures fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as of the grant date. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis for all time-vested awards. For awards with performance based vesting conditions, the timing of expense recognition is based upon management’s estimation of the probability of the performance condition being achieved. Upon determination of the performance condition being deemed probable of achievement, expense is recognized over the remaining service period for performance-based awards. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur for all awards.

Comprehensive loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s only element of other comprehensive loss was unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities.

Stock option valuation

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is determined based upon the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The Company lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of options granted were as follows:

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
 carryforwards of $
315.7
 million and $
332.2
 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are indefinite lived and the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 
2038
. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $
31.2
 million and $
4.7
 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 
2039
 and 
2033
, respectively.

Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company completed a Section 382 study of transactions in its stock through January 25, 2021 and concluded that it had experienced ownership changes since inception that it believes under Section 382 and 383 of the Code will result in limitations on its ability to use certain pre-change NOLs and credits. With additional stock issuances during 2024, the Company continues to analyze the impacts of Section 382. In addition, the Company may experience subsequent ownership changes as a result of future equity offerings or other changes in the ownership of its stock, some of which are beyond the Company's control. As a result, the amount of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards presented in these consolidated financial statements could be limited. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit the use of accumulated state tax attributes.

F-

The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of its federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related primarily to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards.

December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations.

10. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal proceedings

The Company is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. The Company expenses as incurred the costs related to any such legal proceedings.

Other contractual obligations

The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are generally cancelable by the Company upon written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of the service providers, up to the date of cancellation and in the case of certain arrangements may include non-cancelable fees.

On January 15, 2025, the Company entered into a master manufacturing services agreement with a CMO which secures capacity at the CMO’s manufacturing facilities for certain of our product candidates and components thereof. The agreement obligates the Company to compensate the CMO at least $
60
 million for producing certain of our product candidates and components thereof through 2026. In specified termination circumstances, the agreement requires the Company to pay the CMO for services completed, the cost of the CMO’s raw materials that cannot be repurposed and specified cancellation fees. This agreement formalizes and supersedes a letter agreement that the Company entered into with the CMO on July 18, 2024.

11. Segment Reporting

The Company’s segment determination is based on the financial results that are regularly evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to determine resource allocation and assess performance. The Company's CODM is its chief executive officer. The Company has 
one
 operating and one reportable segment. 
Net long-lived assets are all physically located in the United States and the total assets of the segment equal the total assets presented on the consolidated balance sheet. The primary financial measure by which the CODM evaluates the business is net loss. The CODM uses net loss to monitor budget versus actual results to assess performance of the segment. 
A summary of the significant segment expenses reported to the CODM are shown below for the fiscal years ended:
