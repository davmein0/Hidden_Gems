Our common stock purchase plan, which authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock, was authorized by our Board of Directors and publicly announced in August 2019. This plan has no expiration date. We are not obligated to make any purchases under our stock purchase program. Subject to applicable state and federal corporate and securities laws, purchases under a stock purchase program may be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate, depending on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, share price, capital requirements, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. Purchases made under our stock purchase program can be discontinued at any time we determine additional purchases are not warranted.
