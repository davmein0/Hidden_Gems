ITEM 1. BUSINESS

First person pronouns used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to ICU Medical, Inc. (“ICU”) and its subsidiaries unless context requires otherwise.
Company Background and Overview of Business
ICU develops, manufactures and sells innovative medical products used in infusion therapy, vascular access, and vital care applications. Our team is focused on providing quality, innovation and value to our clinical customers worldwide. ICU's product portfolio includes ambulatory, syringe, and large volume IV pumps and safety software; dedicated and non-dedicated IV sets, needlefree IV connectors, peripheral IV catheters, sharps safety products, and sterile IV solutions; closed system transfer devices and pharmacy compounding systems; as well as a range of respiratory, anesthesia, patient monitoring, and temperature management products.
Headquartered in San Clemente, California, ICU was founded in 1984. Our primary customers are acute care hospitals, wholesalers, ambulatory clinics and alternate site facilities, such as outpatient clinics, home health care providers, and long-term care facilities. Since our inception we have grown organically and through acquisitions.
In February 2017, we acquired Pfizer Inc.’s (“Pfizer”) Hospira Infusion Systems (“HIS”) business. The HIS acquisition complemented our legacy non-dedicated infusion sets and oncology business by expanding our product portfolio to include a complete intravenous infusion therapy product-line from IV solutions to IV pumps to non-dedicated infusion sets. 
In November 2019, we acquired Pursuit Vascular, Inc. (“Pursuit”). Pursuit was a privately-held medical device company with a primary focus on innovative catheter disinfecting products and technologies to reduce costly bloodstream infections and lower healthcare costs. Pursuit’s primary product is the ClearGuard
®
 HD cap, which is used for the maintenance of hemodialysis catheters. 
In January 2022, we acquired Smiths Medical 2020 Limited (“Smiths Medical”), the holding company of Smiths Group plc’s ("Smiths") global medical device business. The Smiths Medical acquisition complemented and broadened our preexisting product portfolio by adding syringe and ambulatory infusion devices, vascular access, and vital care products, and we believe has significantly strengthened and expanded our global market reach.
In November 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory America, Inc. (“Otsuka”), a global IV solutions manufacturing subsidiary of Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. Under the agreement, a joint venture will be formed among the Company and ICU Medical Sales, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “ICU Medical Entities”), and Otsuka, to provide additional supply chain resiliency and innovation to our North American IV solutions market under commercial agreements, a services agreement and a license agreement. The transaction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2025.
Products
Our primary product offerings are described below.
Consumables
Our Consumables business unit includes Infusion Therapy, Oncology, Vascular Access and Tracheostomy products.
Infusion Therapy
Our Infusion Therapy products include non-dedicated infusion sets, extension sets, needle-free connectors, and disinfection caps. Infusion sets used in hospitals and ambulatory clinics consist of flexible sterile tubing running from an IV bag or bottle containing a drug product or solution to a catheter inserted in a patient’s vein that may or may not be used with an infusion pump. Disinfection caps are used to actively disinfect access points into the infusion sets and catheters. Our primary Infusion Therapy products are:
1
•
Clave™ needlefree products, including the MicroClave, MicroClave Clear, and NanoClave™ brand of connectors, accessories, extension and administration sets used for the administration of IV fluids and medications;
•
Neutron™ catheter patency device, used to help maintain patency of central venous catheters;
•
Tego™ needlefree connector utilized to access catheters for hemodialysis and apheresis applications; and
•
ClearGuard™, SwabCap™ and SwabTip™ disinfection caps.
Oncology
Closed System Transfer Devices ("CSTD") and hazardous drug compounding systems are used to prepare and deliver hazardous IV medications such as those used in chemotherapy, which, if released, can have harmful effects on the healthcare worker and environment. Our primary Oncology products are:
•
ChemoLockTM CSTD (“ChemoLock”), which utilizes a proprietary needlefree connection method, is used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoLock is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury;
•
ChemoClaveTM  (“ChemoClave”), an ISO Connection standard and universally compatible CSTD used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoClave utilizes standard ISO luer locking connections, making it compatible with all brands of needlefree connectors and pump delivery systems. ChemoClave also is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminate the risk of needlestick injury; and
•
Deltec® GRIPPER® non-coring needles for portal access.
The preparation of hazardous drugs typically takes place in a pharmacy where drugs are removed from vials and prepared for delivery to a patient. Those prepared drugs are then transferred to a nursing unit where the chemotherapy is administered via an infusion pump set to a patient. Components of the ChemoClave and ChemoLock product lines are used both in pharmacies and on the nursing floors for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs.
Vascular Access
Our Vascular Access products are used by clinicians to access the patients' bloodstream to deliver fluids and medication or to obtain blood samples. Our primary Vascular Access products are:
•
Jelco® safety and conventional peripheral IV catheters and sharps safety devices for hypodermic injection, designed to help prevent accidental needlestick injury;
•
Safe-T Wing® venipuncture and blood collection devices;
•

•
Portex® arterial blood sampling syringes;
•
PowerWand® midline catheters; and
•
Cleo® subcutaneous infusion catheters and sets.
Tracheostomy
