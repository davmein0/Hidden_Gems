ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise and establishes reserves as required. As of December 31, 2024, with respect to these outstanding matters, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

ITEM 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
Common Stock
Our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “WSC.” Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The Company had 183,564,899 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 
Preferred Stock
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2024, no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and no designation of rights and preferences of preferred stock had been adopted. 
Holders
As of February 13, 2025, there were 27 holders of record of our Common Stock and no holders of record of our Preferred Stock. The number of holders of record does not include a substantially greater number of “street name” holders or beneficial holders whose Common Stock are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
Dividend Policy
We have strong recurring cash flows, which give us flexibility in how we allocate capital, and we review the appropriate mix of growth investments, debt reduction, and returns to shareholders on an ongoing basis. On February 18, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share as part of a recurring quarterly dividend program. Our Board of Directors will regularly assess the cash dividend program with a long-term focus on increasing the dividend payment over time. The declaration, amount and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our then current financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.
Repurchases
In September 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reset of the share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding shares of Common Stock and equivalents. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases will depend on various factors, including market pricing and conditions, business, legal, accounting, and other considerations. As of December 31, 2024, $821.8 million of the $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available for use.
The following table summarizes our purchase of Common Stock during the fourth quarter of 2024:

Performance Graph
The following stock price performance graph should not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Annual Report on Form 10-K into any filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts. 
The graph below compares the cumulative total return of our Common Stock from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024, with the comparable cumulative return of two indices: the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the Russell 1000 Index. The graph plots the growth in value of an initial investment of $100 in each of our common shares, the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the Russell 1000 Index over the indicated time periods, and as
sumes reinvestment of all dividends, if any, paid on the securities. F
rom January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024
, we did not pay cash dividends and, therefore, the cumulative total return calculation for us is based solely upon share 
price
 appreciation and not upon reinvestment of cash dividends. The share price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
