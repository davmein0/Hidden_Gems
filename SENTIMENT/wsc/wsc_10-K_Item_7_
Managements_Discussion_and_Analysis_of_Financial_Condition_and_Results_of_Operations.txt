Item 7. 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“GAAP”). We use certain non-GAAP financial metrics to supplement the GAAP reported results to highlight key operational metrics that are used by management to evaluate Company performance. Reconciliations of GAAP financial information to the disclosed non-GAAP measures are provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section. 
Executive Summary
We are a leading business services provider specializing in innovative and flexible turnkey temporary space solutions. We offer our customers an extensive selection of space solutions with over 152,000 modular space units and over 210,000 portable storage units in our fleet. Our diverse product offering includes modular space solutions (modular office complexes, mobile offices, classrooms, blast-resistant modules, clearspan structures and sanitation solutions) and portable storage solutions (portable storage containers and climate-controlled containers and trailers). We also offer our customers a thoughtfully curated selection of solutions with Value-Added Products ("VAPS"), such as workstations, furniture, appliances, media packages, power and solar solutions, telematics, connectivity and data solutions, security and protection products, entrance packages, electrical and lighting products, organization and space optimization assets, perimeter solutions and other items that improve the overall customer experience. We operate a hybrid in-house and outsourced logistics and service infrastructure that provides delivery, site work, installation, disassembly, removal and other services to our customers for an additional fee as part of our leasing and sales operations. We service diverse end markets across all sectors of the economy throughout the United States ("US"), Canada, and Mexico. As of December 31, 2024, our branch network included approximately 260 branch locations and additional drop lots to service our over 85,000 customers. 
We primarily lease, rather than sell, our space solutions to customers, which results in a highly diversified and predictable recurring revenue stream. Over 90% of new lease orders are on our standard lease agreement, pre-negotiated master lease or national account agreements. Rental contracts with customers are generally based on a 28-day or monthly rate and billing cycle. The initial lease periods vary, and our leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term and continue until cancelled by the customer or us. Given that our customers value flexibility, they consistently extend their leases or renew on a month-to-month basis such that the average effective duration of our consolidated lease portfolio, excluding seasonal portable storage units, is approximately 41 months. We believe our lease revenue is highly predictable due to its recurring nature and the underlying stability and diversification of our lease portfolio. We complement our core leasing business by selling both new and used units, allowing us to leverage scale, achieve purchasing benefits and redeploy capital employed in our lease fleet. 
We remain focused on safely and frugally growing lease revenue by increasing volumes, driving VAPS penetration, and optimizing rates. To achieve these objectives, we continue to invest in initiatives to improve customer service and increase the scope of our portfolio of turnkey space solutions. In 2024, we supported these initiatives by: 
•
Introducing new VAPS, including solar panels and perimeter solutions,
•
Introducing new powerful digital marketing, customer service, and sales tools to enhance the digital experience for customers,
•
Launching an enhanced customer portal with expanded customer self-service capabilities, and
•
Growing our portfolio of new product solutions for our customers, including climate-controlled storage and clearspan structures.
35
For the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, results and key drivers of our financial performance included:
•
Total revenues increased $31.0 million, or 1.3%, to $2,395.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Leasing revenue increased $5.9 million, or 0.3%, driven by increased pricing and VAPS penetration, partially offset by a decrease in total average units on rent of 33,973, or 13.3%. Lower demand was driven largely by reductions in non-residential construction project start activity over the past two years as a result of higher interest rates. Lower demand reduced deliveries resulting in a decrease in delivery and installation revenue of $18.3 million, or 4.2%. New unit sales revenue increased by $26.4 million, or 54.8%, mostly related to sales activity from a modular space manufacturing business acquired in the third quarter of 2023; and rental unit sales revenue increased $16.9 million, or 37.2%. 
•
Generated income from continuing operations of 
$28.1 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of $313.7 million ver
sus the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease included the $180.0 million termination fee paid to McGrath RentCorp ("McGrath") related to the terminated acquisition of McGrath (see 
"Termination of Agreement to Acquire McGrath RentCorp"
 under 
"Significant Developments"
 below); a $132.5 million impairment loss on intangible asset as a result of our re-branding; and other discrete costs of $64.8 million, including:
–
$42.4 million of legal and professional fees related to the terminated acquisition of McGrath.
–
$8.6 million of restructuring expense largely related to employee termination costs as a result of a cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024 
for certain centralized and redundant resources related to task localization and the unification of our go-to market structure.
–
$8.2 million of integration costs related to the final systems and field harmonization contemplated under the WillScot and Mobile Mini integration plan, which combined sales and operations teams under a single leadership structure and upgraded our field service and dispatch system to better utilize our operational resources across all product lines.
•
Generated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $1,063.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.2%, as compared to 2023. 
•
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $199.6 million to $561.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to payments of $225.7 million for the McGrath termination fee and transaction costs from terminated acquisitions. 
•
Net cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, increased $56.5 million to $241.1 million due to an increase in the purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments of $53.9 million as a result of increased new fleet purchases, modular refurbishments, and investments in VAPS for portable storage containers. Climate-controlled containers represented the majority of new fleet purchases. 
•
Generated Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $553.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of $22.7 million, or 4.1%, as compared to 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we deployed Free Cash Flow to:
–
Acquire assets from a regional provider of modular solutions, two regional providers of climate-controlled storage units, a US national provider of premium large clearspan structures, and a US regional provider of perimeter solutions for $121.2 million.
–
Repurchase $270.4 million of our Common Stock, reducing outstanding Common Stock by 7.1 million shares.
•
We believe the predictability of our Free Cash Flow allows us to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities opportunistically, including investing in organic opportunities we see in the market, maintaining leverage in our stated range, opportunistically executing accretive acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend distributions.
In addition to using GAAP financial measurements, to evaluate our operating results, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Net Capex, which are non-GAAP financial measures. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in "Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures."

Significant Developments
Termination of Agreement to Acquire McGrath RentCorp
On January 28, 2024, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with McGrath. On September 17, 2024, the Company and McGrath mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company paid McGrath a $180.0 million termination fee. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $42.4 million in legal and professional fees related to terminated transactions within selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense.
Segment Reporting
In January 2024, we completed the unification of our go-to market structure by integrating our modular and storage divisions under a single leadership team organized by metropolitan statistical area ("MSA"), which enables us to consistently deliver our portfolio of solutions to our entire customer base. In connection with this change in operating model, we realigned the composition of our operating segments. As a result, we concluded that we have two operating segments (US and Other North America) that aggregate into one reportable segment.
Restructuring
In June 2024, we implemented a cost-reduction plan for certain centralized and redundant resources related to task localization and the unification of our go-to market structure. During the 
year ended December 31, 2024, r
estructuring costs incurred under this plan 
i
ncluded employee termination costs of 
$8.6 million. 
Mobile Mini Trade Name Impairment
In 2024, we executed a rebranding under the WillScot brand name and discontinued the use of the Mobile Mini brand name. T
he Mobile Mini indefinite-lived trade name was tested for impairment, and we
 recorded an impairment loss on intangible asset of $132.5 million on the consolidated statement of operations. After the impairment charge
, t
he remaining net book value of the Mobile Mini trade name was $31.5 million, which is amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset.
Financing Activities
On June 28, 2024, we completed a private offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior secured notes due 2029 (the "2029 Secur
ed Notes") 
to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
. P
roceeds were used to repay approximately $495.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Facility and certain fees and expenses. 
 Asset Acquisitions and Business Combination
During 2024, we acquired certain assets of three regional storage and modular companies, which consisted primarily of approximately 600 cold storage units and 800 modular units, and certain assets of a national provider of clearspan solutions for $84.5 million in cash. As of the acquisition dates, the fair value of rental equipment acquired was $80.7 million.  
During 2024, we also acquired certain assets from a US regional provider of perimeter solutions for $36.8 million in cash. As of the acquisition date, goodwill acquired was $25.3 million, intangible assets acquired were $2.5 million, and the fair value of rental equipment acquired was $8.8 million. The preliminary allocation of purchase price, including the valuation of acquired rental equipment and intangible assets, is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision as additional information is obtained.
Share Repurchases
In September 2024, our Board of Directors approved a reset of our share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 7,133,446 shares of Common Stock for $270.4 million. As of December 31, 2024, $821.8 million of the approved share repurchase pool remained available.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements
In January 2024, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with financial counterparties relating to $500.0 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company's ABL Facility. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company receives a floating rate equal to one-month term SOFR and makes payments based on a fixed interest rate of 3.70% on the notional amount. The swap agreements were designated and qualified as hedges of the Company's exposure to changes in interest payment cash flows created by fluctuations in variable interest rates on the ABL Facility. The swap agreements terminate on June 30, 2027.  
Economic Conditions
In 2024 and 2023, as a result of the decline in non-residential construction starts in the US due to higher interest rates and the impact of these higher rates on lending availability primarily on smaller projects, we experienced a decline in unit activations resulting in lower units on rent. Lower demand in the retail and wholesale trade customer segment also negatively impacted portable storage unit demand. Given the flexibility in our cost structure, we reacted quickly to the lower activity levels and reduced variable costs relative to our forecast. 
37
Business Environment and Outlook
Our customers operate in a diversified set of end markets such as construction and infrastructure; commercial and industrial, including retail and wholesale trade; energy and natural resources; and government and institutions, including education and healthcare. We track several market leading indicators to predict demand, including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial sector and the construction and infrastructure sector, which collectively accounted for approximately 85% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024. Even in an uncertain macro-economic environment, market catalysts such as increased infrastructure spending, onshoring and reshoring, and idiosyncratic growth levers such as continued penetration of our customer base with our VAPS offerings, long-term pricing tailwinds, cross-selling our portfolio of products, and other commercial best practice sharing within WillScot provide us confidence in our continued organic growth outlook. 
Components of Our Consolidated Historical Results of Operations
Revenues
Our revenues consist mainly of leasing and services revenue and sales revenue. We derive our leasing and services revenue primarily from the leasing of space solutions. Included in leasing revenue are VAPS, such as workstations, furniture, appliances, media packages, power and solar solutions, telematics, connectivity and data solutions, security and protections products, entrance packages, electrical and lighting products, organization and space optimization assets, perimeter solutions, and other items our customers use in connection with our products. Delivery and installation revenue includes fees that we charge for the delivery, site work, installation, disassembly, unhooking and removal, and other services to our customers for an additional fee as part of our leasing and sales operations. 
The key drivers of changes in our leasing revenue are:
•
the average number of units on rent;
•
the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS.
The average number of units on rent during a period represents the number of units in use from the time they are leased to a customer until the time they are returned to us. Our average monthly rental rate per unit for a period is equal to the ratio of (i) our rental revenue for that period including VAPS but excluding delivery and installation services and other leasing-related revenues, to (ii) the average number of lease units rented to our customers during that period. We also measure the average utilization rate of our lease units, which is the ratio of (i) the average number of units on rent to (ii) the average total number of units available for lease in our fleet during a period.
In addition to leasing revenue, we also generate revenue from sales of new and used units to our customers, as well as delivery, installation, maintenance, removal services and other incidental items related to accommodation services for our customers. Included in our sales revenue are charges for modifying or customizing sales equipment to customers’ specifications.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues associated with our leasing business includes payroll and payroll-related costs for branch operations personnel, material and other costs related to the repair, maintenance, storage and transportation of rental equipment. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation expense associated with our rental equipment. Cost of revenues associated with our new unit sales business includes the cost to 
purchase
, assemble, transport and customize units that are sold. Cost of revenues for our rental unit sales consist primarily of the net book value of the unit at date of sale. We define gross profit as the difference between total revenues and cost of revenues. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Our SG&A expense includes all costs associated with our selling efforts, including marketing costs, marketing salaries and benefits, as well as the salary, benefits, and commissions of sales personnel. SG&A expense also includes the leasing of facilities we occupy, professional fees and information systems, our overhead costs, such as salaries and other employee costs of management, administrative and corporate personnel, and integration costs associated with acquisitions and business combinations.
Other Depreciation and Amortization
Other depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our property, plant and equipment, as well as the amortization of our intangible assets.
Termination Fee
 On January 28, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with McGrath. On September 17, 2024, the Company and McGrath mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, we paid McGrath a $180.0 million termination fee during the year ended December 31, 2024.
38
Impairment Loss on Intangible Asset
In 2024, we executed a rebranding under the WillScot brand name and discontinued the use of the Mobile Mini brand name. As a result of this rebranding, we recognized an impairment charge of $132.5 million related to the Mobile Mini trade name during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs include one-time termination benefits related to employee separation costs. 
Currency (Gains) Losses, Net
Currency (gains) losses, net includes unrealized and realized (gains) losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than our functional currency at the reporting date.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
Other (income) expense, net primarily consists of (gain) loss on disposal of non-operational property, plant and equipment, insurance proceeds, (gain) loss on investments, other financing-related costs, and other non-recurring charges.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net consists of the costs of external debt, including the Company’s ABL credit facility, outstanding notes, and obligations under finance leases, as well as the impact of interest rate swap agreements and interest income from investments.
Income Tax Expense
We are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada, Mexico, and India. Our overall effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, such as the relative amounts of income we earn in differing tax jurisdictions, tax law changes, and certain non-deductible expenses such as compensation disallowance. The rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, such as legislative enactments and tax credits. These discrete items may not be consistent from year to year. Income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid.
Income from Discontinued Operations
Income from discontinued operations was related to the former UK Storage Solutions segment which was sold in January 2023.

(a) In 2024, we reclassified approximately 2,000 units that were previously reported as modular space units on rent to portable storage units on rent as these units are generally used in a dry storage application. Additionally, based on our segment realignment, we have conformed our VAPS presentation to include all VAPS not specific to portable storage orders as modular space VAPS and recalculated average monthly rental rates. This treatment is consistent with prior treatment in our previous Modular Segment. All historical product operating key performance indicators have been recast to be presented on a comparable basis for all periods.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Revenue:
  Total revenue increased $31.0 million, or 1.3%, to $2,395.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2,364.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Leasing revenue increased $5.9 million, or 0.3%, as compared to 2023 driven by improved pricing and VAPS penetration and the addition of climate-controlled storage containers to our portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in total average units on rent of 33,973, or 13.3%. Total VAPS revenue, which is included in leasing revenue, increased $5.7 million, or 1.5%, to $397.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $391.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. New unit sales revenue increased $26.4 million, or 54.8%, mostly related to sales activity from a modular space manufacturing business we acquired in the third quarter of 2023, and rental unit sales revenue increased $16.9 million, or 37.2%, primarily driven by a single large project in the second quarter and increased overall rental unit sales activity. Partially offsetting these revenue increases, delivery and installation revenue decreased $18.3 million, or 4.2%, due to decreased delivery activity. 
Total average units on rent for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 221,235 and 255,208, respectively. Modular space average units on rent decreased 3,870 units, or 3.9%, and portable storage average units on rent decreased 30,103 units, or 19.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The average modular space unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 61.9%, as compared to 64.4% during 2023. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 60.0%, as compared to 73.4% during 2023. Lower demand was driven largely by reductions in non-residential construction project start activity over the past two years as a result of higher interest rates. Lower demand in the retail and wholesale trade customer segment also negatively impacted portable storage unit demand.
Modular space average monthly rental rates increased $86, or 7.8%, to $1,185 for the year ended December 31, 2024. Increases were driven by a continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities. Average portable storage monthly rental rates of $266 represented an increase of $31, or 13.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of our price management tools and processes, benefits from increased VAPS penetration 
41
opportunities, and higher rental rates on the climate-controlled containers acquired in 2024 and the third and fourth quarters of 2023. 
Gross Profit:
  Gross profit decreased $32.0 million, or 2.4%, to $1,301.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1,333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was a result of a $36.4 million increase in depreciation of rental equipment and a $30.1 million decrease in delivery and installation gross profit. These decreases in gross profit were partially offset by a $19.3 million increase in leasing gross profit and increased new and rental unit sale gross profit of $15.1 million. The increase in leasing gross profit was a result of increased revenues due to favorable average monthly rental rates including VAPS across both portable storage and modular space units, which offset lower units on rent. Cost of leasing and services decreased by $1.6 million, or 0.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a $12.6 million, or 12.1%, decrease in materials costs and a $8.0 million, or 3.1%, decrease in subcontractor costs. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.2 million, or 7.1%, increase in labor costs. Cost of sales increased by $28.2 million, or 56.9%, to $77.8 million, which directionally aligns with increased sales revenue of $43.3 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Our gross profit percentage was 54.3% and 56.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease, as referenced above, was mainly driven by lower utilization rates, specifically on portable storage products. Gross profit percentage was also impacted by lower delivery and installation margins and an increase in new and rental unit sales, which generated lower margins. 
SG&A Expense:
  SG&A expense increased $34.6 million, or 5.8%, to $630.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $596.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Discrete expenses for certain one-time projects, primarily legal and professional fees related to transaction costs from terminated acquisitions, increased $41.8 million. Real estate and occupancy costs increased $14.8 million, or 17.2%, and stock compensation expense increased $1.5 million to $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. These increases were partially offset by a $9.4 million, or 3.7%, decrease in employee costs driven primarily by reduced variable compensation; a $6.6 million, or 8.3%, decrease in service agreements and professional fees; a $4.7 million, or 20.1%, decrease in the provision for credit losses, net of write offs; and a $4.2 million, or 18.3%, decrease in travel costs.
Adjusted EBITDA:  
Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.7 million, or 0.2%, to $1,063.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $1,061.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by a $19.3 million increase in leasing gross profit, a $15.1 million increase in new and rental unit sales gross profit, and decreased SG&A expense, excluding discrete costs, of $6.3 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in was partially offset by decreased delivery and installation gross profit of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 driven by reduced delivery and return volumes and rates, as well as, insurance recoveries received in 2023 related to a 2022 hurricane.
Other Depreciation and Amortization:
 Other depreciation and amortization increased $9.9 million, or 13.6%, to $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to the amortization of the Mobile Mini trade name in 2024.
Termination Fee:
 We paid a termination fee of $180.0 million to McGrath related to the termination of the Merger Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. This fee was treated as an operating expense.
Impairment Loss on Intangible Asset:
 Impairment loss on intangible asset was $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the impairment of the Mobile Mini trade name based on the Company's plan to rebrand under a single WillScot brand name and discontinue the use of the Mobile Mini trade name.
Restructuring Costs:
 Restructuring costs of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 were primarily due to employee termination costs as a result of a cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024 
for certain centralized and redundant resources related to task localization and the unification of our go-to market structure. 
Currency Losses, Net:
 Currency losses, net decreased by $6.2 million to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million loss in 2023 on the settlement of the contingent foreign currency forward contract relating to the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment in January 2023.
Other Expense (Income), Net:
 Other expense, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to other income, net of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a gain on sale of fixed assets related to a real estate sale transaction during the year ended December 31, 2023 and insurance recoveries received in 2023 related to Hurricane Ian in the Gulf Coast area of the United States in 2022.
Interest Expense, Net:
 Interest expense, net increased $22.3 million, or 10.9%, to $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher outstanding debt balances, partially offset by lower overall weighted average interest rates as a result two interest rate swap agreements executed in January 2024. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. 
42
Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations:
 Income tax expense decreased $118.1 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was driven by a decrease in income from continuing operations before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Income from Discontinued Operations:
 Income from discontinued operations of $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was related to the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment in January 2023. 
Capital Expenditures for Rental Equipment:
 Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $53.9 million, or 23.7%, to $280.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of increased modular refurbishment spending, investments in VAPS for portable storage, and new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers. Net CAPEX increased $48.8 million, or 26.4%, to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $184.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by increased capital expenditures for rental equipment as described above and a $11.4 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a $12.7 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and a $3.8 million decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to using GAAP financial measurements, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Set forth below are definitions and reconciliations to the nearest comparable GAAP measure of certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K along with descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, results reported under GAAP. Our measurements of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Our adjusted EBITDA ("Adjusted EBITDA") reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations:
•
Currency (gains) losses, net on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency. 
•
Goodwill and other impairment charges related to non-cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill, other intangibles, rental fleet and property, plant and equipment.
•
Restructuring costs, lease impairment expense, and other related charges associated with restructuring plans designed to streamline operations and reduce costs including employee and lease termination costs.
•
Transaction costs including legal and professional fees and other transaction specific related costs.
•
Costs to integrate acquired companies, including outside professional fees, non-capitalized costs associated with system integrations, non-lease branch and fleet relocation expenses, employee relocation and training costs, and other costs required to realize cost or revenue synergies. 
•
Non-cash charges for stock compensation plans.
•
Other expense, including consulting expenses related to certain one-time projects, financing costs not classified as interest expense, gains and losses on disposals of property, plant, and equipment, and unrealized gains and losses on investments.
Our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates business performance utilizing Adjusted EBITDA as shown in the reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations below. Management believes that evaluating performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to the intrinsic and ongoing operating results of the Company and captures the business performance, inclusive of indirect costs.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing WillScot’s results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
43
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•
other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet our obligations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
WillScot is a holding company that derives its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities of our subsidiaries, borrowings under our ABL Facility, and sales of debt securities. We have consistently accessed the debt and equity capital markets both opportunistically and as necessary to support the growth of our business, desired leverage levels, and other capital allocation priorities. We believe we have ample liquidity in the ABL Facility and are generating substantial Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which together support both organic operations and other capital allocation priorities as they arise. We believe that our liquidity sources are sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating, debt service, and capital requirements over the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to incur additional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as acquisition consideration or as part of an overall financing plan. In addition, we continue to evaluate alternatives to optimize our capital structure, which could include the issuance or repurchase of additional unsecured and secured debt, equity securities and/or equity-linked securities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance or repurchase. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. Availability of financing and the associated terms are inherently dependent on the debt and equity capital markets and subject to change. From time to time, we may also seek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or restructuring our existing debt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration. 
Our revolving credit facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.7 billion, consisting of: (i) a senior secured asset-based US dollar revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.3 billion (the “US Facility”) and (ii) a $400.0 million senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Multicurrency Facility," and together with the US Facility, the “ABL Facility”). Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is equal to the lesser of $3.7 billion and the applicable borrowing bases. The borrowing bases are a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevan
t collateral pool of which our rental equipment represents the largest component. At December 31, 2024, we had 
$1.6 billion
 of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility. 
Cash Flows
The consolidated statements of cash flows include amounts for the UK Storage Solutions segment through January 31, 2023. See Note

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $561.6 million as compared to $761.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $199.6 million. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the payment of $225.7 million for the McGrath termination fee and transaction costs from terminated acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $362.3 million as compared to $350.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $12.3 million. The increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from an increase in the purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments of $53.9 million due to increased refurbishment spending, investments in VAPS for portable storage, and new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers during the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash used for acquisition and divestiture activity during 2024 of $36.4 million, including a decrease of $440.4 million in cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired and a decrease of $404.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $200.1 million as compared to $418.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $218.8 million. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was driven by a decrease of $547.7 million in cash used for the repurchase of common stock. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease of $314.8 million in receipts from borrowings, net of repayments of borrowings.
Material cash requirements
The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:
Debt
The Company has outstanding debt related to its ABL Facility, 2025 Secured Notes, 2028 Secured Notes, 2029, Secured Notes, 2031 Secured Notes, and finance leases, including interest, totaling $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, $549.9 million of which is obligated to be repaid within the next twelve months. We have the intent and believe we have the ability to refinance the $526.5 million carrying value of the 2025 Secured Notes on a long-term basis as demonstrated by our forecasted available capacity under the ABL Facility, among other refinancing alternatives to be considered opportunistically. Refer to Note 10 for further information regarding outstanding debt.
Operating leases
The Company has commitments for future minimum rental payments relating to operating leases, which are primarily for real estate. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had lease obligations of $311.5 million, with $73.8 million payable within the next twelve months.
Other
In addition to the cash requirements described above, the Company has a Share Repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, which allows the Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of outstanding shares of Common Stock.  This program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific amount of shares. As of December 31, 2024, $821.8 million of the authorization for future repurchases of our common stock remained available. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company's management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they consider reasonable under the circumstances and reevaluate their estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results exp
erienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from its estimates. The Company believes that the following critical accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity in the preparation of financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Leasing Revenue 
The Company's lease arrangements can include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space and portable storage units and VAPS. Examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, install
ation, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease components and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Selling (leasing) price of the 
46
lease component is estimated using an adjusted market approach whereby the Company estimates the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay.
Services Revenue 
The Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:
•
Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;
•
Other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and
•
Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.
Consideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using an adjusted market approach. 
Purchase Accounting
The Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and is assigned to the Company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition. 
The Company exercises judgment in the determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives. The estimated fair value and useful lives of customer relationships is determined based on estimates and judgments regarding discounted future after-tax earnings and cash flows arising from customer relationships. The fair value of trade name intangible assets is determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method. A royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value. 
Actual results may vary from these estimates which may result in adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangibles. The Company may record adjustments to the fair values and corresponding adjustment to goodwill during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report provides further discussion regarding business combinations and any fair value adjustments to amounts previously reported.
Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment
The Company performs its assessment of goodwill utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The qualitative impairment test assesses company-specific, industry, market and general economic factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or elects not to use the qualitative impairment test, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model that calculates fair value as the present value of expected cash flows of the reporting units. 
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates and the estimate is inherently sensitive to any material changes to the inputs noted above; these changes could potentially impact the fair value of reporting units.
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of carrying value over fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill attributable to that reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. After determining the Mobile Mini trade name was no longer indefinite-lived and recording an impairment during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s only remaining indefinite-lived intangible asset is the WillScot trade name. The Company performs its assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. When utilizing a quantitative impairment test, the Company calculates fair value using a relief-from-royalty method. This method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent the recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value. 
The relief-from-royalty method requires the Company to make assumptions regarding future revenue and the appropriate selection of royalty and discount rates. Any material deviation in actual results could affect the calculated fair value of the intangible asset.

47
Rental Equipment
Rental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers and VAPS that are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and conversions of rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are either capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking into consideration the residual value of the asset or charged to the customer at the beginning of the lease and expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:
Estimated Useful Life
Residual Value
Modular space units
5 - 30 years
0 - 55%
Portable storage units
7 - 30 years
20 - 55%
VAPS and other related rental equipment
1 - 10 years
0%
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company is exposed to credit losses from trade receivables. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay for the products it leases or sells and the services it provides by conducting a credit review. The credit review considers expected billing exposure and timing for payment and the customer’s established credit rating. The Company performs its credit review of new customers at inception of the customer relationship and for existing customers when the customer transacts after a defined period of dormancy. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, country risk and business strategy in the evaluation.
The Company monitors ongoing credit exposure through an active review of customer balances against established credit limits, contract terms, and due dates. The Company may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. The allowance for credit losses reflects the estimate of the amount of receivables that the Company will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. This estimate is sensitive to changing circumstances. Accordingly, the Company may be required to increase or decrease its allowances in future periods in response to changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers.
Changes in estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If circumstances change in a way that require a change in estimates, such as a change in financial condition of customers or unanticipated changes in the economy, we may accrue additional allowances.
 There were no changes in the Company's estimates or underlying assumptions relating to the determination of the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024 that would have materially impacted the allowance for credit losses. R
efer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for a summary of activity in the allowance for credit losses.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company’s income tax expense.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are indefinitely reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal additional tax cost. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon 
48
ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense. 
The evaluation of uncertain tax positions involves judgment in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. 
None of the critical accounting estimates or assumptions noted above have changed materially since the prior year.
ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows:
Interest Rate Risk
We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility, which bears interest at variable rates. We had $1.6 billion 
in outstanding principal under the ABL Facility at December 31, 2024
. To manage interest rate risk, in January 2024 and January 2023, respectively, we executed interest rate swap agreements relating to an aggregate of $500.0 million and $750.0 million in notional amount of variable-rate debt under our ABL Facility. The January 2024 and January 2023 swap agreements provide for us to pay effective fixed interest rates of 3.70% and 3.44% per annum, respectively, and receive a variable interest rate equal to one-month term SOFR, with maturity dates of June 30, 2027. After taking into account the impact of the swaps, an increase in interest rates by 100 basis points on our ABL Facility would have increased annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million based on outstanding borrowings at 
December 31, 2024
. 
Foreign Currency Risk
In 2024, we generated approximately 94% of our consolidated net revenues in the US, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. However, we are exposed to currency risk through our operations in Canada and Mexico. For the operations outside the US, we bill customers primarily in their local currency, which is subject to foreign currency rate changes. As our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the US increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies, if the US dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the US dollar for consolidation into our financial statements. 
In addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. These gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and rental equipment purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. These exposures are included in currency (gains) losses, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. 
Seasonality
Although demand from certain of our customers is seasonal, our operations as a whole are not impacted in any material respect by seasonality.
Impact of Inflation
Similar to many organizations, we face inflationary pressures across most of our input costs, such as building materials, labor, transportation and fuel. Inflation contributed to increased capital costs for both new units and refurbishment of our existing units. However, given our scale and our strong rate performance, we believe we have been able to navigate the inflationary environment well. Therefore, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.

Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary 
Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of WillScot Holdings Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WillScot Holdings Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income
,
 changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
50
Allowance for Credit Losses
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables. At December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $101.7 million. The allowance for credit losses is estimated based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability.
Auditing the Company's estimation of the allowance for credit losses was judgmental due to the subjectivity in assessing the appropriateness of the assumptions made by management. The assumptions include an expectation that the Company’s collection of receivables will be consistent with historical write-off experience.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its estimation of the allowance for credit losses, including internal controls over the Company’s process to develop the assumptions used to estimate credit losses. 
To test the allowance for credit losses, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing management's process for developing the allowance for credit losses, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data used; and evaluating assumptions used by management, including assessing the Company’s expectation that the collection of receivables will be consistent with historical write-off experience. For example, we compared the days sales outstanding, customer concentration, and days past due as of December 31, 2024, to the Company’s historical experience to evaluate the relevance of the historical data utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses. We also performed sensitivity analyses of various assumptions to evaluate the change in the allowance that would result from changes in assumptions.

WillScot Holdings Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 - 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Nature of Operations
WillScot Holdings Corporation (“WillScot” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a leading business services provider specializing in innovative and flexible turnkey space solutions in the United States (“US”), Canada and Mexico. The Company leases, sells, delivers and installs modular space solutions and portable storage products through an integrated network of branch locations that spans North America.
On September 30, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its former Tank and Pump Solutions ("Tank and Pump") segment. On January 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its former United Kingdom Storage Solutions ("UK Storage Solutions") segment. The consolidated financial statements present the historical financial results of the former Tank and Pump and UK Storage Solutions segments as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 for further discussion.
On July 29, 2024, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to effect a change of the Company’s name from “WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.” to “WillScot Holdings Corporation."
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“GAAP”).

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of WillScot and its subsidiaries that it controls due to ownership of a majority voting interest. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as WillScot. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Trade Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company is exposed to credit losses from trade receivables. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay for the products it leases or sells and the services it provides by conducting a credit review. The credit review considers expected billing exposure and timing for payment and the customer’s established credit rating. The Company performs its credit review of new customers at inception of the customer relationship and for existing customers when the customer transacts after a defined period of dormancy. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, country risk and business strategy in the evaluation.
The Company monitors ongoing credit exposure through an active review of customer balances against established credit limits, contract terms, and due dates. The Company may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. The allowance for credit losses reflects the estimate of the amount of receivables that the Company will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. This estimate is sensitive to changing circumstances. Accordingly, the Company may be required to increase or decrease its allowances in future periods in response to changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers.
Specifically identifiable lease revenue receivables and sales receivables not deemed probable of collection are recorded as a reduction of revenue following the completion of collection efforts. The remaining provision for credit losses is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.

The Company’s trade accounts receivable subject the Company to potential concentrations of credit risk. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers. Receivables related to sales are generally secured by the product sold to the customer. The Company generally has the right to repossess its rental units in the event of non-payment of receivables relating to the Company’s leasing operations.

Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials and finished units for sale. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on the weighted-average cost. The cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition.
Rental Equipment
Rental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers and Value-Added Products (“VAPS”) that are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and conversions of rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are either capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking into consideration the residual value of the asset or charged to the customer at the beginning of the lease and expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:

The Company capitalizes external costs and directly attributable internal costs to acquire or create internal use software incurred subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. 
Costs associated with post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Land is not depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term. Assets leased under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life, unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort).
59
Consistent with the provisions of 
Leases (Topic 842) 
("ASC 842")
, the Company assesses whether any operating lease as
set impairment exists in accordance with the measurement guidance in Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 360, 
Property Plant and Equipment
.
Cloud Computing Arrangements
The Company evaluates implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract under the internal-use software framework. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in the development stage are generally capitalized as other assets. Amortization expense is calculated on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the cloud computing arrangement and recorded as selling, general and administrative expense.

Purchase Accounting
The Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and is assigned to the Company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition. When appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to fair values assigned in purchase accounting result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed in the acquisition of a business. 
Long-lived assets (principally rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing a market approach or a replacement cost approach. Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships and trade names. The Company exercises judgment in the determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives. The estimated fair value and useful lives of customer relationships is determined based on estimates and judgments regarding discounted future after-tax earnings and cash flows arising from customer relationships. The fair value of trade name intangible assets is determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method. A royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value. 
Acquisitions of assets and liabilities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. An asset acquisition is accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. Transaction costs are considered a component of the cost of an asset acquisition.
Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment 
The Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of October 1, as well as during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances occur that, in management’s judgment, may constitute triggering events. The Company performs its assessment of goodwill utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The qualitative impairment test assesses company-specific, industry, market and general economic factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or elects not to use the qualitative impairment test, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model that calculates fair value as the present value of expected cash flows of the reporting units. 
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of carrying value over fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill attributable to that reporting unit.
Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. After determining the Mobile Mini trade name was no longer indefinite-lived and recording an impairment during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s only remaining indefinite-lived intangible asset is the WillScot trade name. The Company performs its assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. When utilizing a quantitative impairment test, the Company calculates fair value using a relief-from-royalty method. This method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. If the 
60
carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent the recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value.
Other intangible assets that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.

Retirement Benefit Obligation
The Company provides benefits to certain of its employees under defined contribution benefit plans. The Company’s contributions to these plans are generally based on a percentage of employee compensation or employee contributions. These plans are funded on a current basis. For its US and Canada employees, the Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans that have discretionary matching contribution and profit-sharing features.
 Fo
r the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
 the Company made matc
hing contributions of
 $
15.1
 million,
 $
14.1
 million and $
13.8
 million to these plans, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
On June 24, 2020, WillScot's stockholders approved the WillScot 2020 Incentive Award Plan ("2020 Incentive Plan") and, as a result, all subsequent incentive awards are granted under the 2020 Incentive Plan. 
The 2020 Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Under the 2020 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant an aggreg
ate of 
6,488,988
 shares of Common Stock in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs, performance compensation awards and stock bonus awards. Stock-based payments, including the grant of stock options, RSAs and RSUs, are subject to service-based vesting requirements, and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Stock-based compensation expense includes grants of stock options, time-based RSUs ("Time-Based RSUs") and performance-based RSUs ("Performance-Based RSUs", together with Time-Based RSUs, the "RSUs"). RSUs are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. In addition, stock-based payments to non-executive directors include grants of RSAs. Time-Based RSUs and RSAs are valued based on the intrinsic value of the difference between the exercise price, if any, of the award and the fair market value of WillScot's Common Stock on the grant date. Performance-Based RSUs are valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the impact of the Performance-Based RSUs market condition. The probability of satisfying a market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant-date fair value for Performance-Based RSUs and the compensation cost is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service has been provided.
RSAs cliff vest in a 
one year
 period. Time-Based RSUs vest ratably over a period of 
four years
. Certain Performance-Based RSUs cliff vest based on achievement of the relative total stockholder return ("TSR") of the Company's Common Stock as compared to the TSR of the constituents in the S&P MidCap 400 Index at the grant date over the performance period of 
three years
. The target number of RSUs may be adjusted from 
0
% to 
200
% based on the TSR attainment levels defined by the Compensation Committee. The 
100
% target payout is tied to performance at the 
50
% percentile, with a payout curve ranging from 
0
% (for performance less than the 
25
% percentile) to 
200
% (for performance at or above the 
85
% percentile). Vesting is also subject to continued service requirements through the vesting date. 
For 
555,790
 Performance-Based RSUs granted in 2021, the awards cliff vest based on achievement of specified share prices of the Company's Common Stock at annual measurement dates over performance periods of 
4.5
 years to 
4.8
 years. The target number of RSUs may be adjusted from 
0
 to 
1,333,334
 based on the stock price attainment levels defined by the Company's Compensation Committee. The 
555,790
 RSU target payout is tied to a stock price of $
47.50
, with a payout ranging from 
0
 RSUs (for a stock price less than $
42.50
) to 
1,333,334
 RSUs (for a stock price of $
60.00
 or greater).
Stock options vest in tranches over a period of 
four years
 and expire 
ten years
 from the grant date. The fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted-average risk-free interest rate and weighted-average expected term of the options. The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was based on a blend of peer group volatility and Company trading history as the Company did not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company to rely exclusively on its own trading history. Future calculations may use the Company trading history. Additionally, due to an insufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post-vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption was based on the simplified method under GAAP, which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each tranche of awards. The mid-point between the weighted-average vesting term and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US Treasury bill yield curve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption. As of December 31, 2024, WillScot had 
not
 declared or paid a cash dividend on common shares.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The Company’s reporting currency is the US Dollar (“USD”). Exchange rate adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in profit or loss, whereas effects resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a component of shareholders’ equity. 
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is different from the USD are translated into USD at exchange rates at the reporting date and income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the respective period. 
61
Exchange rate adjustments resulting from transactions in foreign currencies (currencies other than the Company entities’ functional currencies) are remeasured to the respective functional currencies using exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and are recognized in currency (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a receivable or payable to a consolidated Company entity, the settlement of which is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in the Company entity and are included within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate debt and currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
The Company records derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets (if in an unrealized gain position) or within accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities (if in an unrealized loss position). If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and meets the highly effective threshold, the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings. For any derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings in the period that the change occurs. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing quarterly basis, whether the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are presented based on the underlying nature of the hedged items. 
The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, the Company enters into derivative financial ins
truments only with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions.

Revenue Recognition
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of revenue is generated by rental income subject to the guidance in ASC 842. The remaining revenue is generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or sale of units subject to the guidance in Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 ("ASC 606").
Leasing Revenue 
Income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's lease arrangements can include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space and portable storage units and VAPS. Examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, install
ation, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease components and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Selling (leasing) price of the lease component is estimated using an adjusted market approach whereby the Company estimates the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay.
When leases and services are billed in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered. If equipment is returned prior to the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.
Rental equipment is leased under operating leases. Rental contracts with customers are generally based on a 28‑day or monthly rate and billing cycle. O
perating lease minimum contractual terms generally range from 
1
 month to 
60
 months and leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term. Operating lease minimum contractual terms for modular space products, excluding ground level offices, averaged approximately 
10
 months for the year ended December 31, 
2024
. The rental continues until cancelled by the Company or the customer.
Services Revenue 
The Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:
•
Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;
•
Other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and
•
Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.
Consideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using an adjusted market approach. Revenue from these activities is recognized as the services are performed.
Sales Revenue 
Sales revenue is generated by the sale of new and rental units. Revenue from the sale of new and rental units is generally recognized at a point in time upon the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs when the unit is delivered and installed in accordance with the contract. Sales transactions constitute a single performance obligation.
62
Other Matters
The Company's non-lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, other than the variability for service arrangements expected to be performed beyond a twelve-month period. 
The Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customer and the product or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. While the Company may bill certain customers in advance, its contracts do not contain a significant financing component based on the short length of time between upfront billings and the performance of contracted services. For certain products, services, or customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. At December 31, 2024, current deferred revenue and customer deposits included deferred reven
ue of $
249.0
 million and customer deposits of $
1.8
 million,
 respectively. At December 31, 2023, current deferred revenue and customer deposits included deferred revenue of 
$
222.5
 million
 and customer deposits of 
$
2.0
 million
, respectively. 
Revenue is recognized net of sales tax billed to customers, which is subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Leases as Lessee
The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices, administrative offices, rental equipment storage properties, vehicles and equipment, and administrative operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases are classified as either finance or operating at inception of the lease, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. Short-term leases, defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Company has leases that contain both lease and non-lease components and has elected, as an accounting policy, to not separate lease components and non-lease components. Right of use ("ROU") assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability is calculated as the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for existing leases using either the rate implicit in the lease or, if none exists, the Company's incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for those leases where the implicit rate is not known. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what would be the Company's secured credit rating. Variable lease payments are expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments include payments for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, management fees and insurance.
Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include one or more options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise the option. Additionally, the Comp
any’s leases do not generally include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
Advertising and Promotion
Advertising and promotion costs, which are expensed as incurred
, were $
15.9
 million
, $
10.5
 million and $
8.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Shipping Costs
The Company includes costs to deliver rental equipment to customers, whether performed by third-parties or by internal employees, in costs of leasing and services and cost of sales.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company’s income tax expense.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are indefinitely reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal 
63
additional tax cost. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense.
The Company accounts for any impacts of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") in the period in which they are incurred.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair va
lue measurement. The inputs are prioritized into three levels that may be used to measure fair value. See further discussion of the levels in Note 15.
Warrants
The Company accounted for warrants as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreements. In periods subsequent to issuance, warrants classified as liabilities were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and transaction date with changes in the estimated fair values of the common stock warrant liabilities and gains and losses on extinguishment of common stock warrant liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Effective 
November 29, 2022

Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2024 and for the years ended December 31, 2025 through 2029 and thereafter, future committed leasing revenues under non-cancelable operating leases with the Company’s customers, excluding revenue from delivery and installation and potential lease extensions, were as follows:

Receivables 
The Company manages credit risk associated with its accounts receivables at the customer level. Because the same customers generate the revenues that are accounted for under both ASC 606 and ASC 842, the discussions below on credit risk and the Company's allowance for credit losses address the Company's total revenues.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to the Company's receivables is limited because of a large number of geographically diverse customers who operate in a variety of end markets. 
No single customer accounted
 for more 
than 
1.7
% and 
1.0
% of the Company’s receivables at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's top five customers with the largest open receivables balances represented 
5.2
% and 
4.3
%
 of the total receivables balance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company manages credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and other monitoring procedures.
The Company's allowance for credit losses reflects its estimate of the amount of receivables that it will be unable to collect
. The estimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, related aging, and historical collection experience. T
he Company's estimates reflect changing circumstances, and the Company may be required to increase or decrease its allowance. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized bad debt 
expense to reflect changes in the allowance for credit losses of $
20.4
 million, $
23.4
 million, and $
10.4
 million, respectively, within SG&A expense in its consolidated statements of operations. 
Contract Assets and Liabilities
When customers are billed in advance for services, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the related services are performed, which generally occurs at the end of the contract. The balance sheet classification of deferred revenue is determined based on the contractual lease term. For contracts that continue beyond their initial contractual lease term, revenue continues to be deferred until the services are performed. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $
139.4
 million and $
124.1
 million, respectively, of deferred revenue related to service revenue billed in advance. During the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
 $
72.7
 million, $
67.6
 million and $
47.2
 million, 
respectively, of deferred revenue related to service revenue billed in advance was recognized as revenue
. 
The Company does not have material contract assets, and it did not recognize any material impairments of any contract assets. 
The Company's uncompleted contracts with customers have unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations. For the future services revenues that are expected to be recognized within twelve months, the Company has elected to utilize the optional disclosure exemption made available regarding transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations. The transaction price for performance obligations that will be completed in greater than twelve months is variable based on 
the market rate in place at the time those services are provided,
 and therefore, the Company is applying the optional exemption to omit disclosure of such amounts. 
The primary costs to obtain contracts for new and rental unit sales with the Company's customers are commissions. The Company pays its sales force commissions on the sale of new and rental units. For new and rental unit sales, the period benefited by each commission is less than one year. As a result, the Company has applied the practical expedient for incremental costs of obtaining a sales contract and expenses commissions as incurred.

$
38.5
 million, $
25.8
 million and $

 million, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that a review of the carrying value of the Mobile Mini trade name was necessary based on the Company's plan to rebrand under a single WillScot brand name and discontinue the use of the Mobile Mini trade name. As of 
June 30, 2024, the Mobile Mini trade name was tested for impairment using the relief from royalty valuation method. 
The estimate of fair value included a discount rate of 
9
%, an unobservable input (Level 3). 
After determining the estimated fair value, t
he Company recorded an 
impairment charge
 of $
132.5
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. This non-cash charge was recorded to impairment loss on intangible asset on the consolidated statement of operations. After the impairment charge
, t
he remaining net book value of the Mobile Mini trade name was $
31.5
 million, which is being amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset.

Asset Backed Lending Facility
On July 1, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Company, including Williams Scotsman, Inc. ("WSI"), entered into an asset-based credit agreement. As amended on June 30, 2022, the agreement provides for revolving credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of up to $
3.7
 billion, consisting of: (i) a senior secured asset-based US dollar revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $
3.3
 billion (the “US Facility”), (ii) a $
400.0
 million senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Multicurrency Facility," and together with the US Facility, the "ABL Facility"), available to be drawn in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, British Pounds Sterling or Euros, and (iii) an accordion feature that permits the Company to increase the lenders' commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $
750.0
 million and the amount of suppressed availability (as defined in the ABL Facility), plus any voluntary prepayments that are accompanied by permanent commitment reductions under the ABL Facility, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including lender approval. The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027. 
The applicable margin for Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Rate, Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), British Pounds Sterling and Euro loans is 
1.50
%. In addition to the applicable margin, the facility includes a credit spread adjustment of 
0.10
%. The applicable margin for base rate and Canadian Prime Rate loans is 
0.50
%. The applicable margins are subject to one step down of 
0.25
% or one step up of 
0.25
% based on the Company's leverage ratio and excess availability from the prior quarter. The ABL Facility requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused available borrowings of 
0.20
% annually. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the ABL Facility, as adjusted for the effects of the interest rate swap agreements, was 
5.33
%. Refer to Note 14 for a more detailed discussion on interest rate management. 
On February 26, 2024, WSI entered into an amendment to the ABL Facility (the "Fifth Amendment") to, among other things, change the rate under the ABL Facility for borrowings denominated in Canadian Dollars from a Canadian Dollar Offered Rate ("CDOR")-based rate to a Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA")-based rate, subject to certain adjustments specified in the ABL Facility, and to update certain other provisions regarding successor interest rates to CDOR. On February 27, 2024, WSI and certain other subsidiaries of the Company entered into an amendment to the ABL Facility (the "Sixth Amendment"), which was to become effective upon the closing of the Company's proposed acquisition of McGrath. Following the termination of the Merger Agreement on September 17, 2024, the Sixth Amendment was null and void.
Borrowing availability under the US Facility and the Multicurrency Facility is equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate Revolver Commitments and (ii) the Borrowing Base ("Line Cap"). At December 31, 2024, the Line Cap was $
3.2
 billion and the Borrowers had approximately $
1.6
 billion of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility, including $
1.4
 billion under the US Facility and $
183.1
 million under the Multicurrency Facility. Borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility is made available for up to $
220.0
 million letters of credit and $
220.0
 million of swingline loans. At December 31, 2024, the available capacity was $
199.4
 million of letters of credit and $
219.3
 million of swingline loans. At December 31, 2024, letters of credit and bank guarantees carried fees of 
1.625
%. The Company had issued $
20.6
 million of standby letters of credit under the ABL Facility at December 31, 2024. The Company had approximately $
1.6
 billion outstanding principal under the ABL Facility at December 
71
31, 2024. Debt issuance costs of $
19.0
 million and $
26.8
 million were included in the carrying value of the ABL Facility at December 31, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023, respectively
.
The obligations of the US Borrowers are unconditionally guaranteed by WSI and each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned US organized restricted subsidiary of WSI, other than excluded subsidiaries (together with WSI, the "US Guarantors"). The obligations of the Multicurrency Borrowers are unconditionally guaranteed by the US Borrowers and the US Guarantors, and each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned Canadian organized restricted subsidiary of Holdings other than certain excluded subsidiaries (together with the US Guarantors, the "ABL Guarantors").

The 2025 Secured Notes, 2028 Secured Notes, 2029 Secured Notes and 2031 Secured Notes (collectively, “the Secured Notes”) are unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, “the Note Guarantors”). WillScot is not a guarantor of the Secured Notes. The Note Guarantors are guarantors or borrowers under the ABL Facility. To the extent lenders under the ABL Facility release the guarantee of any Note Guarantor, such Note Guarantor will also be released from obligations under the Secured Notes. The Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured by a second priority security interest in substantially the same assets of WSI and the Note Guarantors securing the ABL Facility. Upon the repayment of the 2025 Secured Notes and the 2028 Secured Notes, if the lien associated with the ABL Facility represents the only lien outstanding on the collateral under the 2029 Secured Notes and the 2031 Secured Notes (other than certain permitted), the collateral securing the 2029 Secured Notes and the 2031 Secured Notes will be released and the 2029 Secured Notes and the 2031 Secured Notes will become unsecured subject to satisfaction of customary conditions.

The Company's valuation allowance increased by $
2.8
 million from 2023, related to capital loss generated from the McGrath termination fee that is not more likely than not realizable in certain states that do not allow capital loss carryback or carryforward.
Tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 are outlined in the table below and include US Federal and US state. The availability of these tax losses to offset future income varies by jurisdiction. Furthermore, the ability to utilize the tax losses may be subject to additional limitations upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in the ownership of the Company. Some of the Company’s tax attributes are subject to annual limitations due to historical changes in ownership from acquisitions, mergers or other related ownership shift events; however, the Company anticipates that our remaining available net operating losses will be consumed prior to their expiration.

As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of the basis difference in investments outside the US, which are indefinitely reinvested and for which deferred taxes have not been provided, is approximately 
$
162.0
 million
. The tax, if any, associated with the recovery of the basis difference is dependent on the manner in which it is recovered and is not readily determinable.
Unrecognized Tax Positions
The Company is subject to taxation in US, Canada, Mexico, India,

and state jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by the applicable tax authorities prior to the expiration of statute of limitations for assessing additional taxes, which generally ranges from two to five years after the end of the applicable tax year. As of December 31, 2024, generally, tax years for 
2018 through 2023
 remain subject to examination by the tax authorities. In addition, in certain taxing jurisdictions, in the case of carryover tax attributes to years open for assessment, such attributes may be subject to reduction by taxing authorities.

At December 31, 2024
 there were $
25.8
 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. 
The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 
2023,
 and 2022, the Company recognized approximately $(
0.2
) million, $
0.0
 million, and $(
0.1
) million in interest, respectively. The Company accrued approximately $
0.2
 million and $
0.4
 million for the payment of interest at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Future tax settlements or statute of limitation expirations could result in a change to the Company’s uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $
0.2
 million of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation, audit settlements or resolution of tax uncertainties.
NOTE 14 - 
Derivatives
Interest Rate Swaps
In January 2024, the Company entered into 
two
 interest rate swap agreements with financial counterparties relating to $
500.0
 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the ABL Facility. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company receives a floating rate equal to one-month term SOFR and makes payments based on a fixed interest rate of 
3.70
% on the notional amount. The swap agreements terminate on June 30, 2027. 
In January 2023, the Company entered into 
two
 interest rate swap agreements with financial counterparties relating to $
750.0
 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company’s ABL Facility. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company receives a floating rate equal to one-month term SOFR and makes payments based on a fixed interest rate of 
3.44
% on the notional amount. The swap agreements terminate on June 30, 2027. 
In 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial counterparty relating to $
400.0
 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the ABL Facility. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR and made payments based on a fixed interest rate of 
3.06
% on the notional amount. The swap agreement terminated on May 29, 2022. 
The swap agreements were designated and qualified as hedges of the Company’s exposure to changes in interest payment cash flows created by fluctuations in variable interest rates on the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2024, the floating rate that the Company received under the terms of these swap agreements was 
4.34
% for the swap agreements entered in January 2023 and 
4.38
% for the swap agreements entered in January 2024.

Foreign Currency Contract
In December 2022, the Company executed a contingent forward contract to sell £
330.0
 million upon the closing of the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment at a price ranging from 
1.20550
 to 
1.20440
 USD to British Pounds Sterling. The price was dependent upon the date of the closing of the sale. This contract, which was to expire on September 11, 2023, mitigated the foreign currency risk of the USD relative to the British Pound Sterling prior to the closing of the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment. This contract did not qualify for hedge accounting and was revalued at fair value at the reporting date with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Company's results of operations. Upon the closing of the sale of the UK Storage Solutions segment on January 31, 2023, the Company settled the contingent forward contract and received cash at an exchange rate of 
1.205
 USD to British Pounds Sterling.

NOTE 15 - 
Fair Value Measures
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
The Company utilizes the following accounting guidance for the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 -
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 -
Observable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3 -
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions
The Company has assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, marketable securities, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts. The Company's nonfinancial assets, which are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, include rental equipment, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and certain other assets. Based on the borrowing rates currently available for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair values of finance leases at 
December 31, 2024
 and December 31, 2023 approximate their respective book values. The carrying value of the ABL Facility, excluding debt issuance costs, approximates fair value as the interest rates are variable and reflective of current market rates. 
The fair values of the 2025 Secured Notes, the 2028 Secured Notes, the 2029 Secured Notes, and the 2031 Secured Notes are based on their last trading price at the end of each period obtained from a third party. 
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of these financial liabilities measured using Level 2 inputs:

NOTE 17 - 
Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise and establishes reserves as required. As of December 31, 2024, with respect to these outstanding matters, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 
Purchase Commitments 
In November 2024, the Company entered into a fixed-dollar unconditional purchase obligation with a supplier for rental equipment. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase $
20.0
 million of rental equipment at any time prior to November 2027. The Company has no other material outstanding purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024.

NOTE 18 - 
Segment Reporting
In January 2024, the Company completed the unification of its go-to market structure by integrating its modular and storage divisions under a single leadership team organized by geography, achieving local product unification within each metropolitan statistical area and the ability to consistently deliver its portfolio of solutions to its entire customer base. In connection with this change in operating model, the Company realigned the composition of its operating and reportable segments to reflect how its Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") reviews financial information to allocate resources to and assess performance of the segments. As a result, the Company concluded that its 
two
 operating segments (US and Other North America) are aggregated into 
one
 reportable segment as the operating segments share similar economic characteristics (e.g., comparable gross margins and comparable adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins) and similar qualitative characteristics as the operating segments offer similar products and services to similar customers, use similar methods to distribute products and are subject to similar competitive risks. All historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation.
The Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company.
Refer to Note 4 for revenue by geographic area and revenue by major product and service lines. Refer to Note 7 for rental equipment by geographic area. Refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheet for total assets. Refer to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for total expenditures for additions to long-lived assets. 
The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest (income) expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization. The Company reflects further adjustments to EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what the Company considers transactions or events not related to its core and ongoing business operations. The measure of profit or loss used by the CODM to evaluate operating segment performance and allocate resources is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used to determine capital allocation between operating segments and certain aspects of management's compensation. Management believes that evaluating operating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to the intrinsic and ongoing operating results of the Company. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important metric because it reflects the business performance of the segments, inclusive of indirect costs.

NOTE 19 - 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income attributable to WillScot common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. The shares of Common Stock issued as a result of the vesting of RSUs and RSAs as well as the exercise of stock options or redemption of warrants are included in EPS based on the weighted average number of days in which they were outstanding during the period. 
Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Effects of potentially dilutive securities are present
ed only in periods in which they are dilutive. 
The following table reconciles income from continuing operations attributable to WillScot common shareholders to net income attributable to common shareholders for the dilutive EPS calculation and the weighted average shares outstanding for the basic calculation to the weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted calculation for the years ended December 31:

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As required by SEC rules and regulations, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our ICFR includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
ICFR, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's ICFR as of December 31, 2024 using the criteria set forth in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on that assessment, the Company's management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company's ICFR was effective based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of the Company’s ICFR as of 
December 31, 2024
 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2024
.
Changes in Internal C
ontrol over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our ICFR that occurred during the quarter ended 
December 31, 2024
 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of WillScot Holdings Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited WillScot Holdings Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, WillScot Holdings Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB
.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
