ITEM 2.    Properties
Our primary corporate headquarters is located in Phoenix, Arizona, with additional shared services locations in Baltimore, Maryland; Orlando, Florida; and India. We operate approximately 260 branch locations and additional drop lots across the US, Canada, and Mexico. Collectively, we lease approximately 85% of our branch properties and own the remaining balance. Our management believes that none of our properties, on an individual basis, is material to our operations, and that our properties are well maintained and suitable for their intended use. We further believe that these locations generally have adequate capacity and can accommodate seasonal demands, changing product mixes and additional growth. 
Subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our owned real and personal property in the US and Canada is encumbered under our credit facility and our secured notes. We do not believe that the encumbrances will materially detract from the value of our properties, or materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
