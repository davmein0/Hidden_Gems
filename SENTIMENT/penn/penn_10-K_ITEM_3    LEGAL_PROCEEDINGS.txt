ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings from time to time relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial transactions, development agreements and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate the risk of loss pertaining to covered matters, legal and administrative proceedings can be costly, time-consuming and unpredictable. The Company currently does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to
