Reportable Segments
We have five reportable segments: Northeast, South, West, Midwest, and Interactive. Our gaming and racing properties are grouped by geographic location, and each is viewed as an operating segment with the exception of our two properties in Jackpot, Nevada, which are viewed as one operating segment. We consider our combined Video Gaming Terminal (“VGT”) operations, by state, to be separate operating segments. 
The Northeast, South, West, and Midwest segments (referred to as our “retail segments”) primarily generate revenue from gaming operations (such as slot machines and table games), food and beverage offerings, and hotel visitation. The Interactive segment includes all of our online sports betting, online casino/iCasino, and social gaming (collectively referred to as “online gaming”) operations, management of retail sports betting, media, and the operating results of Barstool Sports, Inc. (“Barstool” or “Barstool Sports”) subsequent to the Barstool Acquisition on February 17, 2023 and prior to the Barstool divestiture on August 8, 2023 (as defined and discussed in 
Note 5, “Acquisitions and Dispositions”

in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements
). See 
Note 17, “Segment Information”
 and 
Note 11, “Leases”
 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment and lease structure information, respectively.
