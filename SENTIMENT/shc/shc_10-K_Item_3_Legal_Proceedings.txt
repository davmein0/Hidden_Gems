Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information for Common Stock 
The Company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SHC.”
Holders
As of February 20, 2025, we had approximately 77 holders of record of our common stock. This number does not include the beneficial owners of our common stock who hold their shares through banks, brokers or other financial institutions.
Dividends
We do not currently expect to pay any dividends on our common stock. Instead, we intend to use any future earnings for the operation and growth of our business and the repayment of indebtedness. 
Future cash dividends on our common stock, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
Because we are a holding company and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and any funds we receive from our subsidiaries. The agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain negative covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and the terms of any future loan agreement into which we may enter or any additional debt securities we may issue are likely to contain similar restrictions on the payment of dividends. In addition, Delaware law imposes requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends. 
Stock Performance Graph
The following performance graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Health Care Index. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each index on November 20, 2020, the date our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq, and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2024. The returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors we describe in Item 1A, 
“
Risk Factors
”
 and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
We are a leading global provider of mission-critical end-to-end sterilization solutions, lab testing and advisory services for the healthcare industry. We are driven by our mission: Safeguarding Global Health
®
. We provide end-to-end sterilization as well as microbiological and analytical lab testing and advisory services to help ensure that medical, pharmaceutical and food products are safe for healthcare practitioners, patients and consumers in the United States and around the world. In 2024, our customers included over 40 of the top 50 medical device companies and nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies (based on revenue). Our services are an essential aspect of our customers’ manufacturing processes and supply chains, helping to ensure sterilized medical products reach healthcare practitioners and patients. Most of these services are necessary for our customers to satisfy applicable government requirements.
49
We are a trusted partner to approximately 5,000 customers in over 50 countries. We strive to give our customers confidence that their products meet regulatory, safety and effectiveness requirements. With our industry-recognized scientific and technological expertise, we help to promote the safety of millions of patients and healthcare practitioners around the world every year. Across our 62 facilities worldwide, we have over 3,000 employees who are dedicated to safety and quality.
We serve our customers throughout their product lifecycles, from product design to manufacturing and delivery, helping to promote the sterility, effectiveness and safety of their products for the end user. We operate across two core businesses: sterilization services and lab services. Each of our businesses has a longstanding record and is a leader in its respective market, supported and connected by our core capabilities including deep end market, regulatory, technical and logistics expertise. The combination of Sterigenics, our terminal sterilization business, and Nordion, our Co-60 supply business, makes us the only vertically integrated global gamma sterilization provider in the sterilization industry. This provides us with additional insights and allows us to better serve our customers. For financial reporting purposes, our sterilization services business breaks out into two reportable segments, Sterigenics and Nordion, and our lab services business constitutes a third reportable segment, Nelson Labs.  
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded net revenues of $1,100.4 million, net income of $44.4 million, Adjusted Net Income of $198.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $548.6 million. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures 
not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). 
For the definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures from net income (loss), please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” 
TRENDS AND KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
We expect that our performance and financial condition will continue to be driven by the key trends impacting our industries, customers and their end markets as outlined in Item 1, “Business.” In addition, we believe the following trends and key factors have underpinned our recent operating results and may continue to affect our performance and financial condition in future periods. 
•
Business and market conditions.
 Consolidated net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased from the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily a result of favorable pricing and improvements in volume and mix across all three reportable segments, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchanges rates.
As discussed in 
Item 1A, 
“
Risk Factors
”
, a portion of our supply of Co-60 is generated by Russian nuclear reactors.  We continue to monitor the potential for disruption in the supply of Co-60 from Russian nuclear reactors. There was no impact to our supply or revenue in the 
year ended December 31, 2024.
•
Investment initiatives.
 We continue to advance our growth-related investments, including our two active capacity expansion projects within the Sterigenics segment, Co-60 development projects in the Nordion segment and lab expansion efforts to support pharma testing services in the Nelson Labs segment.
•
Disciplined and strategic M&A activity
. We remain committed to our highly disciplined acquisition strategy and continue to seek suitable acquisition targets.
•
Litigation costs
. We are currently the subject of tort lawsuits alleging injury by purported exposure to EO used, emitted or released by current facilities in Atlanta, Georgia and Vernon, California and our former facility in Willowbrook, Illinois. Additional EO lawsuits have been threatened relating to Sterigenics’ former facility in Willowbrook and existing facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Grand Prairie, Texas; and Vernon, California and may be filed in the future relating to these or Sterigenics’ other EO facilities; these threats of additional EO lawsuits are comparable to threats that have similarly been made against other companies within our industry. In addition, we are defendants in a lawsuit brought by the State of New Mexico Attorney General alleging that emissions of EO from our Santa Teresa facility negatively impacted Santa Teresa and surrounding communities. We maintain that these facilities did not pose and do not pose any safety risk to their surrounding communities. We deny the allegations in these lawsuits and are vigorously defending against these claims. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded costs of $32.7 million, $45.3 million and $72.6 million, respectively, representing professional fees and other expenses related to litigation associated with our EO sterilization facilities.

Borrowings, financing costs and financial leverage
. On May 30, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which provided for the issuance of term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $1,509.4 million maturing on May 30, 2031. On the same date, the Company issued Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million, which bear interest at an annual rate of 7.375% and mature on June 1, 2031. The proceeds from the Refinancing Term Loans and the issuance of the Secured Notes, along with cash on the balance sheet, were used to refinance all of the Company’s previously outstanding term loans due December 2026.
COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Net Revenues 
Service revenues primarily consist of revenue generated from contract sterilization and lab testing and advisory services within our Sterigenics and Nelson Labs segments, respectively. Service revenues also primarily consist of Co-60 installation and disposal revenues and gamma irradiation system refurbishments and installation services within our Nordion segment. Product revenues primarily consist of revenues generated from sales of Co-60 radiation sources and gamma irradiation systems. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, and other adjustments may be provided for as reductions in net revenues. Refunds, returns, warranties and other related obligations are not material to any of our business units, nor do we intend to incur material incremental costs to secure customer contracts. 
Cost of Revenues 
Our cost of revenues consists primarily of direct materials, utilities, labor and related benefit costs, and depreciation and amortization. Although the cost of utilities and direct materials can fluctuate, the remaining components of cost of revenues are generally more stable. Direct material costs relating to service revenues primarily includes EO gas, nitrogen gas and Co-60. The physical decay of Co-60 assets is included within depreciation expense as a cost of revenue. Direct material costs relating to product revenues also include the costs associated with acquiring Co-60 in finished or semi-finished form, acquiring Co-59 in a form ready for insertion into reactors for conversion into Co-60, the reactor time and associated services to convert Co-59 into Co-60, and parts and equipment associated with maintaining gamma irradiation systems. 
Operating Expenses 
SG&A Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) primarily consists of compensation and benefits costs and general operating and administrative expenses, including professional service fees (which include finance and legal costs), travel and entertainment expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation expense is also included in SG&A.  

Amortization of Intangible Assets 
Amortization of intangible assets primarily consists of expense associated with customer relationship intangible assets, the majority of which relate to the fair values attributed to these assets upon the recapitalization of the Company in connection with the acquisition by the Sponsors in 2015. These customer relationship intangible assets were initially assigned a weighted average useful life of ten years and have a remaining useful life of approximately one year. These customer relationship intangible assets accounted for approximately $48.4 million of our current annual amortization expense and are expected to be fully amortized in 2025. Amortization expense fluctuates when we have an acquisition, disposition, impairment charge, or as their useful lives expire.
Operating Income 
Operating income represents gross profit, less SG&A and amortization of intangible assets. 
Interest Expense, Net 
Interest expense, net, represents interest paid or accruing on our outstanding indebtedness and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense, net is primarily affected by changes in average outstanding indebtedness (including finance lease obligations) and variable interest rates. We present interest expense net of interest income, which primarily consists of interest earned on cash on hand.
51
Loss on Refinancing of Debt
Loss on refinancing of debt for the year ended December 31, 2024 occurred in connection with the refinancing of our capital structure in May 2024 and Amendment No. 3 (as defined below) to Revolving Credit Facility. The refinancing activity primarily resulted in the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts on the Term Loans due 2026. In addition, certain new debt issuance costs 
and discounts were expensed upon the issuance of the Refinancing Term Loans and Secured Notes.
Georgia EO litigation settlement
On October 16, 2023, the Company reached an agreement to resolve 79 EO claims in the State of Georgia. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company paid $35.0 million to settle the claims. 
Illinois EO litigation settlement
On January 9, 2023, the Company reached agreements to settle approximately 880 pending and threatened EO claims in Illinois. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company paid $407.7 million to settle the claims.
Impairment of investment in unconsolidated affiliate
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.6 million related to a joint venture investment, which was acquired as part of the 2020 acquisition of Iotron Industries Canada, Inc.. Due to a shift in business strategy, the joint venture did not proceed. Based on these facts and circumstances, we concluded that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2022.
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net primarily consists of changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in Nordion’s contracts, the net impact of pension related benefits and the income related to deferred income on a lease associated with the 2018 divestiture of the Medical Isotopes business.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
Provision for income taxes primarily consists of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and U.S. federal and state income taxes.
Constant Currency Sales Growth (Non-GAAP) 
“Constant currency” is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to assess performance excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Constant currency sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales in local currency at the average exchange rates applicable for the current period. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 
We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as the principal measures of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without the impact of certain non-cash items and non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future and other items that are not core to our operations. We believe that these measures are useful to our investors because they provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. In addition, we believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA will assist investors in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. Our management also uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA in their financial analysis and operational decision-making and Adjusted EBITDA serves as the metric for attainment of our primary annual incentive program. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies. 
52
For more information regarding our definition and calculation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, including information about its limitations as a tool for analysis and reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7. 
Segment Income 
Segment income is the primary earnings measure we use to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, as disclosed in Note 21, “Segment and Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements. Costs associated with support functions that are not directly associated with one of the three reportable segments, such as corporate operating expenses for executive management, accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, treasury, investor relations, corporate development, tax, purchasing, and marketing, are allocated to the segments based on net revenue. Corporate operating expenses that are directly incurred by a segment are reflected in each segment’s income. Segment income excludes certain items which are included in “Income (loss) before taxes” as determined in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following section summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The discussion of the consolidated results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations.”

Net revenues were $1,100.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $51.2 million, or 4.9%, as compared with the prior year. Net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024 increased approximately 5.4% compared with the same period in 2023 on a constant currency basis. 
53
Service revenues
Service revenues increased $36.2 million, or 4.0%, to $941.8 million in 2024 as compared to $905.6 million in 2023. Favorable pricing of $30.6 million and $6.7 million in the Sterigenics and Nelson Labs segments, respectively, coupled with an increase in service revenue volume and mix of $2.2 million and $1.0 million in the Sterigenics and Nelson Labs segments, respectively, were the primary drivers of service revenue growth. Partially offsetting these growth factors was a $2.2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates across all segments as well as a decline in service revenue of $2.1 million in the Nordion segment.
Product revenues 
Product revenues increased $14.9 million, or 10.4%, to $158.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $143.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Volume and mix growth of $10.3 million coupled with favorable pricing of $7.3 million were the primary drivers of the increase in product revenues. Partially offsetting these growth factors was an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.7 million.

Total cost of revenues accounted for approximately 45.3% and 45.0% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Cost of service revenues 
Cost of service revenues increased $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The primary drivers of the increase in cost of service revenues were higher employee compensation costs of $10.1 million, a $5.1 million increase in depreciation related to capital assets recently placed in service and an increase in certain facility repairs and maintenance costs of $3.3 million. The remaining difference was primarily driven by other inflationary pressures. This was partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.2 million.

Cost of product revenues 
Cost of product revenues increased $5.1 million, or 9.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of higher volumes of Co-60 shipments and supplier mix, which resulted in increases in direct material and material transportation costs of $4.8 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a $0.8 million favorable impact to cost of product revenues.
Operating Expenses

Operating expenses accounted for approximately 27.7% and 28.6% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
SG&A 
SG&A increased $6.0 million, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by $9.9 million of incremental SG&A compensation related costs and a $4.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in legal and other professional services expenses.

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets decreased $1.8 million, or 2.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, due primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Expense, Net 
Interest expense, net increased $21.8 million, or 15.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. Lower favorability from interest rate derivative activity of $15.0 million coupled with an $8.4 million decline in interest income on cash and cash equivalents on deposit at financial institutions were the primary drivers of the increase in interest expense, net.
Loss on Refinancing of Debt
Loss on refinancing of debt for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $24.2 million and primarily occurred in connection with the refinancing of our capital structure in May 2024 and Amendment No. 3 to Revolving Credit Facility. The refinancing activity resulted in the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts on the Term Loans due 2026. In addition, certain new debt issuance costs and discounts were expensed upon the issuance of the Refinancing Term Loans and Secured Notes.
Georgia EO litigation settlement
On October 16, 2023, the Company reached an agreement to resolve 79 pending EO claims in the State of Georgia. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $35.0 million in January 2024 to settle the claims.
Foreign Exchange Loss
Foreign exchange loss was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Foreign exchange gains and losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) mainly relates to short-term gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating entities. As described in Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk”, we enter into monthly U.S. dollar-denominated foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international subsidiaries.
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 28.0%, as compared to the prior year. The fluctuation was primarily driven by a $3.9 million unfavorable change in the fair value of embedded derivatives in Nordion’s purchase and sales contracts, partially offset by $1.1 million of other income related to a tax credit incentive.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes was $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $54.7 million in the prior year. The change was primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income of $113.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and an incremental increase in the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”). 
Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a net increase in the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the foreign rate 
55
differential, partially offset by a benefit for state income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense as well as federal and state net operating loss carryforward balances, the impact of the foreign rate differential and GILTI, partially offset by a benefit for state income taxes. 
Net Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $44.4 million, as compared to net income of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the factors described above. Adjusted Net Income was $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $204.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the factors described above. Adjusted EBITDA was $548.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $528.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the factors described above. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we consider Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, financial measures that are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. 
We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before amortization and certain other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before interest expense, depreciation (including depreciation of Co-60 used in our operations) and income tax provision applicable to Adjusted Net Income.
We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as the principal measures of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without the impact of certain non-cash items and non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future and other items that are not core to our operations. We believe that these measures are useful to our investors because they provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. In addition, we believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA will assist investors in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. Our management also uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA in their financial analysis and operational decision-making, and Adjusted EBITDA serves as the basis for the metric we utilize to determine attainment of our primary annual incentive program. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. For example, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA primarily exclude: 
•
certain recurring non-cash charges such as depreciation of fixed assets, although these assets may have to be replaced in the future, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset retirement obligations (“ARO”);
•
costs of acquiring and integrating businesses, which will continue to be a part of our growth strategy;
•
non-cash gains or losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the mark-to-fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, which includes the embedded derivatives relating to certain customer and supply contracts at Nordion;
•
impairment charges on long-lived assets, intangible assets and investments accounted for under the equity method;
•
loss on refinancing of debt incurred in connection with refinancing or early extinguishment of long-term debt;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the secondary offering of our common stock and other shareholder activities;
•
expenses and charges related to the litigation, settlement agreements, and other activities associated with our EO sterilization facilities, including those related to Willowbrook, Illinois, Atlanta, Georgia, Santa Teresa, New Mexico and Vernon, California;
56
•
in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and
•
share-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense and an important part of our compensation strategy.
In evaluating Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP measures.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated:

 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have three reportable segments: Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources within our business based on segment income, which excludes certain items which are included in income (loss) before tax as determined in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The accounting policies for our reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. 
Our Segments 
Sterigenics 
Our Sterigenics business provides outsourced terminal sterilization and irradiation services for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety and advanced applications markets using three major technologies: gamma irradiation, EO processing and E-beam irradiation. 
Nordion 
Our Nordion business is a leading global provider of Co-60 used in the sterilization and irradiation processes for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety, and high-performance materials industries, as well as in the treatment of cancer. In addition, Nordion is a leading global provider of gamma irradiation systems. 
As a result of the time required to meet regulatory and logistics requirements for delivery of radioactive products, combined with accommodations that we make to our customers to minimize disruptions to their operations during the installation of Co-60, Nordion sales patterns can often vary significantly from one quarter to the next. In most cases, however, timing-related impacts on our sales performance tend to be resolved within several quarters, resulting in more consistent performance over longer periods of time. In addition, sales of gamma irradiation systems occur infrequently and tend to be for larger amounts.
Nelson Labs 
Our Nelson Labs business provides outsourced microbiological and analytical chemistry testing and advisory services for the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. 
For more information regarding our reportable segments please refer to Item 1. “Business” and Note 21, “Segment and Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements.

Net Revenues 
Sterigenics net revenues were $697.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $30.7 million, or 4.6%, as compared to the prior year. The 
increase was attributable to a favorable impact from
 pricing of 4.6% and changes in volume and mix of 0.3%, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 0.3%.
Nordion net revenues were $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.9 million, or 8.0%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by growth from volume and mix and pricing of 4.9% and 5.2%, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 2.1%.
Nelson Labs net revenues were $229.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $7.5 million, or 3.4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 3.0% favorable impact from pricing and 0.4% from changes in volume and mix.
Segment Income 
Sterigenics segment income was $378.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $16.0 million, or 4.4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase in segment income was driven mainly by favorable pricing, partially offset by inflation and certain facility repairs and maintenance costs.

Nordion segment income was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $4.5 million, or 4.7%, as compared to the prior year. The increase in segment income was driven primarily by favorable pricing and higher volumes and mix, partially offset by supplier mix. The decrease in segment income margin was driven by higher employee compensation costs and unfavorable mix.
Nelson Labs segment income was $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 0.1%, as compared to the prior year. Pricing and labor productivity improvements resulted in a favorable impact to segment income during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this and negatively impacting segment income margin were increases in employee compensation costs and unfavorable mix. 
59
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Sources of Cash
The primary sources of liquidity for our business are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2024, we had $278.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is a decrease of $22.8 million from the balance at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to $179.0 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment, $50.6 million of cash used in financing activities and a $17.4 million decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by $224.2 million of cash provided by operating activities. Our foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately $259.8 million at December 31, 2024 and $224.1 million at December 31, 2023. No material restrictions exist to accessing cash held by our foreign subsidiaries notwithstanding any potential tax consequences.
Refer to “Debt Facilities” below within this Item, Note 9, “Long-Term Debt”, and Item 1A, 
“
Risk Factors
”
 - “Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity” for additional information.
As described in more detail below, on March 1, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Revolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 3 did not materially change the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, including
with respect to the amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, which remain $423.8 million.
As discussed below, on May 30, 2024 the Company and SHH closed on the Refinancing Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,509.4 million as well as an issuance of Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million, both of which mature in 2031. The Company used the net proceeds from the Refinancing Term Loans and Secured Notes, along with cash on hand, to refinance its previously outstanding $1,763.1 million and $496.3 million Term Loans due 2026.
Uses of Cash
We expect that cash on hand, operating cash flows and amounts available under our credit facilities will provide sufficient working capital to operate our business, meet foreseeable liquidity requirements (inclusive of debt service on our long-term debt), make expected capital expenditures including investments in fixed assets to build and/or expand existing facilities, and meet litigation costs that we expect to continue to incur for at least the next twelve months. Our primary long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months will be to service our debt, make capital expenditures, and fund suitable business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect any excess cash provided by operations will be allocated to fund capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to meet future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of macroeconomic, competitive and business factors, including interest rate changes and changes in our industry, many of which are outside of our control. As of December 31, 2024, our interest rate derivatives limit our cash flow exposure of our variable rate borrowings under the Term Loans. Refer to Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk”, “
Derivative Instruments
” for additional information regarding the interest rate limits used to manage economic risks associated with our variable rate borrowings. Refer to Item 7A., 
“
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
”
 for additional information about changes in interest rate risk.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. This program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, Co-60 used by Sterigenics at its gamma irradiation facilities, cobalt development projects and information technology enhancements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our capital expenditures amounted to $179.1 million, compared to $215.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024 included approximately $32 million related to environmental facility enhancements.
In 2024, we expect to continue to invest in facility expansions, ongoing routine maintenance for existing facilities, and acquisition of Co-60 for use by our Sterigenics segment in its gamma irradiation facilities. In addition, we expect to invest in special projects related to development of new Co-60 supply sources and facility enhancements at our EO sterilization facilities. For 2025, it is estimated that approximately $46 million of capital expenditures will relate to environmental facility enhancements.
60
Debt Facilities 
Senior Secured Credit Facilities
On December 13, 2019, SHH, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into senior secured first lien credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), consisting of both a prepayable senior secured first lien term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to a first lien credit agreement (as amended through Amendment No. 4, the “Credit Agreement”). The total borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is $423.8 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide SHH the right at any time and under certain conditions to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit commitments based on a formula defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
On May 30, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 4 (“Amendment No. 4”) to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Among other changes, Amendment No. 4 provides for Refinancing Term Loans to SHH in an aggregate principal amount of $1,509.4 million. Pursuant to Amendment No. 4, the Refinancing Term Loans shall have an applicable interest rate margin per annum equal to (i) ABR plus 2.25% for ABR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) daily simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 3.25% for RFR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (iii) Term SOFR plus 3.25% for Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case with a 0% applicable floor and the applicable interest rate margin shall be subject to a pricing step-down of 0.25% when the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 3.30:1.00. The Refinancing Term Loans amortize at a rate of 1.00% per annum and mature on May 30, 2031. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Refinancing Term Loans for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 8.29%.
On May 30, 2024, SHH, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, paying agent, registrar, transfer agent and notes collateral agent, entered into an Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing SHH’s $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Secured Notes”) issued in May 2024. The Secured Notes will pay interest semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, at a rate of 7.375% per year, and will mature on June 1, 2031. The Secured Notes may be redeemed, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2027 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, the Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.375% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Further, at any time or from time to time, on or before June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 10% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) during each of the twelve-month periods ending after the issue date, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The obligations under the Indenture are secured on a first-lien basis by security interests in substantially all of the assets of SHH, the Company and the Guarantors (other than any excluded assets) that secure the Credit Agreement on a pari passu basis, subject to certain limitations, exceptions and permitted liens. These obligations are secured pursuant to a security agreement, dated as of May 30, 2024, by and among SHH, the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the “Security Agreement”), as may be amended from time to time, and related financing statements. 
The Company used the combined net proceeds from the Refinancing Terms Loans and Secured Notes, along with cash on hand, to refinance its previously outstanding $1,763.1 million Term Loan due 2026 and $496.3 million Term Loan B due 2026.
On March 1, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No. 3”) to the Revolving Credit Facility. Among other changes, Amendment No. 3 provides (i) for new commitments under the existing Revolving Credit Facility to replace the existing revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $83.0 million, (ii) that certain of the lenders providing revolving credit commitments shall also provide additional commitments for the issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $37.5 million and (iii) for the extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 1, 2029.
61
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture contain additional covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and qualifications, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to engage in certain activities, such as incur additional indebtedness or permit to exist any lien on any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired, as specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including upon a change of control. In addition, an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture would occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries received one or more enforceable judgments for payment in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) $162.6 million or (ii) 30.0% of consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement and the Indenture, respectively) and the judgments were not stayed or remained undischarged for a period of 60 consecutive days. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. 
All of SHH’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Company, with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured by substantially all assets of SHH and the guarantors, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions and exclusions, as outlined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Indenture and the Security Agreement.
Outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by encumbrances against the Revolving Credit Facility and the collateral pledged thereunder, or by cash placed on deposit with the issuing bank. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $14.0 of letters of credit issued against the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in total availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of $409.8 million.
Term Loan Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to reduce the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable rate debt due to changes in SOFR. For additional information on the derivative instruments described above, refer to Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk”, 
“Derivative Instruments.”

Cash Flow Information
The following section summarizes cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Operating activities 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $371.9 million to net cash provided of $224.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $147.7 million for the prior year. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 compared to the prior year was due mainly to the timing of cash outflows for the Illinois and Georgia EO litigation settlements.  Approximately $407.7 million was paid in June 2023 for the settlements of the Illinois EO claims, whereas $35.0 million was paid in January 2024 for settlement of the Georgia EO claims.
62
Investing activities 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $35.9 million to net cash used of $179.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $214.9 million for the prior year. The variance was mainly driven by a decrease in capital expenditures of $35.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
Financing activities 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $50.6 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $266.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulting in a net change of $316.5 million. The difference was mainly attributable to $5.0 million of debt repayments (net of debt proceeds) in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $297.5 million of debt proceeds (net of repayments) in the year ended December 31, 2023 resulting in a $302.5 million net change in cash outflow. Cash outflows for debt issuance costs also increased $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. In addition, a purchase option for a leased facility was exercised in the first quarter of 2024 resulting in a $6.7 million cash outflow.

(a)
Represents principal and interest payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Secured Notes. We have calculated the interest payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities using an assumed range of 6.91% to 7.84% based on anticipated forward movements in SOFR and the fixed rate of 7.375% for the Secured Notes. In addition, interest payments include the impact of existing interest rate swaps described in Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk” in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
(b)
Consists of payments under our finance leases for various facilities and equipment. 
(c)
Represents minimum lease payments under our operating leases for several of our facilities and other property and equipment. 
(d)
Consists of our best estimate of our obligations under various supply and service agreements, primarily Co-60, that are enforceable and legally binding on us. 
(e)
Consists of our best estimate of our obligations to purchase EO gas under commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us. We have excluded contracts to purchase energy and other supplies, which generally have terms of one year or less. Our contract to purchase EO gas in the U.S. requires us to purchase all our requirements from our supplier, and our contracts to purchase EO gas outside the U.S. generally require that we purchase a specified percentage of our requirements for our operations in the countries covered by those contracts. Although our EO gas contracts generally do not contain fixed minimum purchase volumes, we have calculated the amounts set forth in the table above based on the percentage of our requirements specified in the contracts and our budgeted purchase volumes for those periods.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $58.5 million and $67.3 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit, surety bonds and other bank guarantees outstanding, primarily in favor of local and state licensing authorities for future decommissioning costs, and to support the unfunded portion of our pension obligation. We are obligated to provide financial assurance to local and state licensing authorities for possible future decommissioning costs associated with the various facilities that hold Co-60. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $49.1 million and $48.2 million, respectively, of the standby letters of credit and surety bonds referenced above were outstanding in favor of the various local and state licensing authorities in the event we defaulted on our decommissioning obligation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. Our discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement, not duplicate, our summary of significant accounting policies so that readers will have greater insight into the uncertainties involved in these areas. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions at a specific point in time and in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, giving due consideration to materiality. The application of accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Revenue Recognition
. The majority of our sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when control of promised goods or services have transferred to our customers. Revenues recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed as of the end of the period. 
Refunds, returns, warranties and other related obligations are not material to any of our business units and we do not incur material incremental costs to secure customer contracts. 
The Sterigenics segment provides outsourced terminal sterilization and irradiation services for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety and advanced applications markets. We typically have multi-year service contracts with our significant customers, and these sales contracts are primarily based on customers’ purchase orders. Given the relatively short turnaround times, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point-in-time upon the completion of sterilization or irradiation processing and the approval of our quality assurance process, at which time the service is complete. 
The Nordion segment is a provider of Co-60 and gamma irradiation systems, which are key components to the gamma sterilization process. Revenue from the sale of Co-60 radiation sources is recognized at a point-in-time upon satisfaction of our performance obligations for delivery/installation and disposal of existing sources. Revenue from the sale of gamma irradiation systems in our Nordion segment is recognized over time using an input measure of costs incurred and is immaterial to the overall business. 
The Nelson Labs segment provides outsourced microbiological and analytical chemistry testing and advisory services for the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. We provide our customers mission-critical lab testing services, which assess the product quality, effectiveness, patient safety and end-to-end sterility of products. These services are necessary for our customers’ regulatory approvals, product releases and ongoing product performance evaluations. Nelson Labs services are generally provided on a fee-for-service or project basis, and we recognize revenues over time generally using an input measure of time incurred to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Revenue recognized over time in excess of the amount billed to the customer is recorded as a customer contract asset. When we receive consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods or services under the terms of a sales contract, we record deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. We utilize our customer relationship management system to assess time incurred and the extent of project completion at the end of the period.  
We do not capitalize sales commissions because substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less. Furthermore, costs to fulfill a contract are not material. 
Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, and other adjustments are provided for as reductions in net revenues in the period the related sale was recorded. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in net revenues, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of net revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from net revenue. 
Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year. 
64
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
. Assets and liabilities of a business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We generally supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results. 
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily certain regulatory licenses and trade names, are tested for impairment annually as of October 1. If circumstances change during interim periods between annual tests that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company tests such assets at an interim date for impairment. Factors which would necessitate an interim impairment assessment include prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.
At December 31, 2024, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $1,398.7 million, or 45.5% of our total assets. We consider the impairment analyses of these assets critical because of their quantitative significance to the Company and our segments.
Goodwill is assigned to our segments at December 31, 2024 as follows:

We performed a quantitative assessment of all reporting units (Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs) as of October 1, 2024. The fair value of each reporting unit was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis which was dependent on subjective market participant assumptions determined by management. Assumptions used in the analyses included discount rates, revenue growth rates and projected operating cash flows. Estimates of future cash flows are based upon relevant data at a point-in-time, are subject to change, and could vary from actual results. Cash flows are based on recent historical results and are consistent with the Company’s near-term financial forecasts and long-term strategic plans. The estimated fair value of Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs each exceeded its carrying amount (including goodwill) by an adequate margin to support a positive assertion that goodwill is not impaired as of October 1, 2024. No factors were identified that would result in the potential impairment to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. There have been no other significant events or circumstances that occurred since the annual assessment date of October 1 that would change the conclusions reached above. We provide additional information about our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements. 
Income Taxes
. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Measurements of deferred taxes requires the use of judgment with respect to the realization of tax basis. We periodically review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, expected timing of reversals of existing temporary timing differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on management’s estimate, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates used in the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts and circumstances. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance of $160.6 million and $125.4 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets, primarily attributable to the excess interest expense on our long-term debt in the United States, as well as state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Changes in our judgment related to the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our results of operations. 
We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position meets the more likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being 
65
realized upon ultimate settlement. Determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the more likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position are matters of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations, and precedent. Changes in our judgment related to the assessment of uncertain tax positions could materially impact our results of operations. 
We are subject to taxation from federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The United States Internal Revenue Service routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 10, “Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements. 
Commitments and Contingencies
. We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents, mass tort), regulation (e.g., failure to meet specification or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters) and other claims for damage and relief. 
We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. If a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability is disclosed within our consolidated financial statements, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if the range is determinable and material. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. For legal proceedings and claims described within our consolidated financial statements, we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses, if a range is determinable. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters, the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory and legal matters in future periods may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. The Company may also incur material defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We record gain contingencies when realized and expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 19,

“Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements.
The Company reached agreements to settle approximately 880 pending and threatened EO claims in the State of Illinois on January 9, 2023. Under the binding Settlement Agreements, the Company paid $407.7 million to settle the claims.
On October 16, 2023, the Company reached an agreement to resolve 79 EO claims in the State of Georgia. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company paid $35.0 million to settle the claims.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business, see Note 2, “Recent Accounting Standards” to our consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business, primarily changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory risk. 
Commodity Price Risk 
We purchase our supply of EO gas from various suppliers around the world, but in the United States there is a sole supplier for EO gas used for applications relevant to our business. We are exposed to market risk based on fluctuations in the price of EO gas. 
66
We actively seek to manage the risk of fluctuating prices through long-term supply and service contracts. Most of our Sterigenics customer contracts contain provisions that permit us to pass through all or a portion of our supply price increases to our customers, though some of our contracts do not contain these provisions. Even for contracts that do contain these provisions, there is often at least a brief lag between when we incur increased costs for supplies and when we can pass through these costs to our customers. In addition, even when we are contractually permitted to pass on price increases, we may decide not to do so to preserve our sales volumes or for other reasons. 
Interest Rate Risk 
We are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. From time to time, the Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to reduce the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable rate borrowings.
In March 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $400.0 million. The interest rate swap’s effective date began on August 23, 2023 and expires on August 23, 2025. We designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the SOFR benchmark interest rate of our Term Loan. We receive interest at the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay a fixed interest rate under the terms of the swap agreement.
In May 2022, we entered into two interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1,000.0 million for a total option premium of $4.1 million. The interest rate caps became effective as of July 31, 2023 and expired on July 31, 2024. We designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges that were designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate of our Term Loan. Under the current terms of the loan agreement, the benchmark interest rate index transitioned from LIBOR to Term SOFR on June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the interest rate cap agreements hedged the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in SOFR by limiting our cash flow exposure related to Term SOFR under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to 3.5%.
In October 2021, we entered into two interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1,000.0 million for a total option premium of $1.8 million. Both interest rate caps were effective on December 31, 2022 and expired on July 31, 2023. These interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges and were designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in LIBOR (or its successor), the benchmark interest rate being hedged, by limiting our cash flow exposure related to the LIBOR base rate under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to 1.0%.
Based on our indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2024, the interest rate under our Term Loans that was in effect on December 31, 2024, and after applying the effects of interest rate caps and the swap referenced above, a 1.0% increase in the interest rate under our outstanding debt obligations as of December 31, 2024, would increase interest expense by approximately $11.1 million per year. 
See Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk” to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the activity of the interest rate caps for the periods presented. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of the countries in which we operate may affect the value of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other figures presented in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currencies. We translate the financial statements of subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency to their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets and liabilities. Translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. 
Our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we are unable to match net revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses incurred in the same currency. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) as foreign exchange loss (gain).
67
The Company also routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk of our intercompany loans in certain of our international subsidiaries and non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency forward contracts expire on a monthly basis. The net fair value of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $0.1 million as of each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Approximately 44.0% of our revenues and 47.3% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024 were derived from operations outside the United States. Holding other variables constant (such as interest rates and debt levels), if the U.S. dollar had appreciated by 10% against the foreign currencies used by our operations in the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues would have been reduced by approximately $48.4 million and gross profit by approximately $26.1 million.
Regulatory Risk 
We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and routine regulatory audits, and we must receive permits, licenses, and/or regulatory clearance or approval for numerous aspects of our operations. Regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance or may require the provision of additional data, and regulatory processes may be time consuming and costly, and their outcome may be uncertain in certain of the countries in which we operate. Regulatory agencies may also change policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, any of which could impact our ability to provide our services. Our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of these agencies may subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions could include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention and total or partial suspension of operations. The failure to receive or maintain, or delays in the receipt of, relevant U.S. or international regulatory qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Sotera Health Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sotera Health Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Valuation of Nelson Labs Reporting Unit Goodwill
Description of the Matter
As disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2024, the Company reported $1.1 billion of goodwill; of that, $172.4 million related to the Nelson Labs reporting unit. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1. Management performed a quantitative impairment assessment for its annual evaluation of the Nelson Labs reporting unit in 2024. As part of the quantitative impairment test, management estimated the fair value of the Nelson Labs reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach.
70
Auditing the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment for the Nelson Labs reporting unit was complex due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, this fair value measurement was sensitive to revenue growth rates and projected EBITDA margins. Elements of these assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future market or economic conditions. 
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment process. This included controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.
To test the estimated fair value of the Nelson Labs reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodology, testing the significant assumptions described above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to the revenue growth rates and projected EBITDA margins, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry data and historical performance. We performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology and significant assumptions used by the Company.

Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
 – Sotera Health Company (also referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or “its”), is a leading global provider of mission-critical end-to-end sterilization solutions, lab testing and advisory services for the healthcare industry with operations primarily in the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results, and cash flows of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). 
We operate and report in 
three
 segments, Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs. We describe our reportable segments in Note 21, “Segment and Geographic Information.” All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates
 – In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and the accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the estimates and assumptions used and revise them as new information becomes available. Actual results may vary from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 – We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents may include various deposit accounts and money market funds.

A
ccounts Receivable - 
Accounts receivable consists of amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible receivables to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable 
– We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed to us by customers. We estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, customer financial information and credit ratings, current market conditions as well as the expected future economic conditions that may impact the collection of accounts receivable. We also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to pay. We generally do not charge interest on accounts receivable or require collateral from our customers.
We record write-offs against the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable when all reasonable efforts for collection have been exhausted. As a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. These analyses require judgment. If the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable.

Inventories
 – Inventories as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are held at Nordion. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of material, labor, and manufacturing overhead are determined using standard cost, which approximates average cost. We review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. We record a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which was immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023, when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. If future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
Property, Plant, and

Equipment
 – Property, plant, and equipment is carried at cost, or initially at fair value if acquired in an acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Except for Co-60, a radioactive isotope used in gamma radiation sterilization, all property, plant, and equipment depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Co-60 is amortized using an accelerated method, which relates to the natural radioactive decay of the isotope over its estimated useful life which is approximately 
twenty years
. Amortization of Co-60 is included within depreciation expense as a cost of revenue. Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally 
one
 to 
five 
76

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
years
. 
For software obtained or developed for internal use, all external direct costs for materials and services and certain personnel costs incurred to d
evelop the software during the application development stage are capitalized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had undepreciated software costs of $
11.4
 million and $
7.9
 million, respectively, included in property, plant, and equipment, net. We recognized $
4.2
 million, $
3.3
 million a
nd $
2.2
 million, of depreciation expense related to software costs for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Depreciation is computed using the assets’ estimated useful lives as presented below:

–

 years
From time to time, we build or expand facilities. The cost of construction of these facilities is reflected as construction-in-progress until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which time the costs are reclassified to the appropriate depreciable category of property, plant, and equipment and depreciation commences. Fixed asset projects requiring one or more years to complete construction qualify for capitalization of interest costs in accordance with our policy. Interest related to property, plant and equipment projects with a construction period of less than one year are not capitalized and are immaterial. Repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. 
Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected as a component of operating income.

Leases 
– We determine if an agreement contains a lease and classify our leases as operating or finance at the lease commencement date. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Non-lease components are accounted for separately from the lease components for all asset classes.
Finance leases are those in which we will pay substantially all the underlying asset’s fair value or will use the asset for all or a major part of its economic life, including circumstances in which we will ultimately own the asset. Lease assets arising from finance leases are included in “Property, plant and equipment, net” and the liabilities are included in “Finance lease obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For finance leases, we recognize interest expense using the effective interest method and we recognize amortization expense on the lease asset over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of asset. Finance leases are accounted for as if the assets were owned and financed, with associated expense recognized in “Interest expense, net” and “Cost of revenues” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) depending on the nature of the underlying asset.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we estimate an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. Our estimated incremental borrowing rate reflects a secured rate based on recent debt issuances, our estimated credit rating, and lease term. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in “Cost of revenues” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) depending on the nature of the underlying asset.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
 – Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily certain regulatory licenses and tradenames, are tested for impairment annually as of October 1. If circumstances change during interim periods between annual tests that would indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company tests such assets at an interim date for impairment. Factors that necessitate an interim impairment assessment include prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. 
77
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We performed a quantitative assessment of all reporting units (Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs) as of October 1, 2024. The fair value of each reporting unit was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis which was dependent on subjective market participant assumptions determined by management. We further corroborated these discounted cash flow analyses utilizing a market approach to determine the estimated enterprise fair value. Assumptions used in the analyses included discount rates, revenue growth rates and projected operating cash flows. Estimates of future cash flows are based upon relevant data at a point-in-time, are subject to change, and could vary from actual results. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a sufficient margin to support a positive assertion that goodwill is 
no
t impaired. We performed a qualitative impairment assessment to evaluate any potential impairment to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. We considered significant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, and determined, after considering the totality of evidence that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. There have been no other significant events or circumstances that occurred since the annual assessment date of October 1 that would change the conclusions reached above.

Derivative Instruments
 – We may enter into derivative instruments and hedging activities to manage, where possible and economically efficient, commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk related to borrowings. We also have identified embedded derivatives in certain supply and customer contracts. Certain interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges allowing for changes in fair value to be recorded through “Other comprehensive income (loss).” Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and are presented in “Interest expense, net” within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any changes in the value being recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the same line item as the corresponding hedged item. We classify cash flows from derivative instruments and hedging activities as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. To the extent derivative arrangements are with the same counterparty and contractual right of offset exists under applicable master agreements, we offset assets and liabilities for reporting on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension, Post-Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans – 
We sponsor a defined-contribution retirement plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor various post-employment benefit plans at our Nordion business in Canada, including defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, retirement compensation arrangements and plans that provide extended health care coverage to retired employees. In addition, we provide other benefit plans at our foreign subsidiaries, including a supplemental retirement arrangement, a retirement and termination allowance and post-retirement benefit plans, which include contributory healthcare benefits and contributory life insurance coverage. All non-pension post-employment benefit plans are unfunded. 
These costs and obligations are affected by assumptions including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the annual rate of change in compensation for eligible employees, estimated changes in costs of healthcare benefits, and other demographic and economic factors. We review the assumptions used on an annual basis. 
We recognize the over/under funded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefits plans in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”). Changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the year they occur. We measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. We provide additional information about our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans in Note 11, “Employee Benefits.”
Amortization of net gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified to net periodic pension cost if, as of the beginning of the year, that gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the PBO or the market related value of the plan assets (the ‘corridor’). As most of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average remaining life expectancy is used.
Asset Retirement Obligations (“ARO”)
 – ARO are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets or the exit of a leased facility. We recognize a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and the associated asset retirement costs are then capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. We lease various facilities where sterilization and ionization services are performed. Under the lease agreements, we are required to return the facilities to their original condition and to perform decommissioning activities. In addition, certain of our 
78
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
owned facilities are required to be decommissioned when we vacate the facility. Accretion expense is recognized in cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.

Debt Issuance Costs, Premiums and Discounts
 – We have incurred costs in connection with obtaining financing as well as premiums and discounts associated with our long-term debt. The portion of these fees that are capitalized are recorded as a reduction of debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized into interest expense over the term of the debt agreement. Debt issuance costs associated with the Company’s revolving credit facilities are classified as assets unless there are outstanding borrowings under such arrangements.

Concentration of Credit Risk, Other Risks and Uncertainties
 – We maintain cash and cash equivalents in the form of demand deposits in accounts with major financial institutions in the U.S. and in countries where our subsidiaries operate. Deposits in these institutions may exceed amounts of insurance provided on such accounts. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents.

Our net revenues and accounts receivable are derived from customers located primarily in North America and Europe. 
No customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 and 2023, or 10% or more of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Income Taxes
 –We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on management’s estimate, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates used in the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts and circumstances.
We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position are matters of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations, and precedent.   We are subject to a tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) which we record as a period cost.
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Foreign Currency Translation
 – The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are generally translated into U.S. dollars at the current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated using weighted-average rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments from foreign currency translation are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
Gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) as foreign exchange loss (gain). The Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk of our intercompany loans in certain of our international subsidiaries and non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency forward contracts expire on a monthly basis.
 For the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
 foreign exchange loss related primarily to short-term losses (offset by short-term gains) on sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating entities.

Revenue Recognition
 – Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The majority of our sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point-in-time when control of promised goods or services have transferred to our customers. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed as of the end of the period. 
Refunds, returns, warranties and other related obligations are not material to any of our segments and we do not incur material incremental costs to secure customer contracts. 
Our Sterigenics segment provides outsourced terminal sterilization and irradiation services for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety and advanced applications markets. We typically have multiyear service contracts with our significant customers, and these sales contracts are primarily based on customers’ purchase orders. Given the relatively short turnaround times, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point-in-time upon the completion of sterilization or irradiation processing and approval by our quality assurance process. Sterigenics segment revenues are included in service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
Our Nordion segment is a global provider of Co-60 and gamma irradiation systems, which are key components to the gamma sterilization process. Revenue from the sale of Co-60 sources is recognized as product revenue at a point-in-time upon satisfaction of our performance obligations for delivery of existing sources. Revenue from the sale of gamma irradiation systems is recognized as product revenue over time using an input measure of costs incurred and is immaterial to the overall business. Revenues from Co-60 installation and disposal and gamma irradiation systems refurbishments and installations are recognized as service revenue.
Our Nelson Labs segment provides outsourced microbiological and analytical chemistry testing and advisory services for the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. We provide our customers mission-critical lab testing services, which assess the product quality, effectiveness, patient safety and end-to-end sterility of products. These services are necessary for our customers’ regulatory approvals, product releases and ongoing product performance evaluations. Nelson Labs services are generally provided on a fee-for-service or project basis, and we recognize revenues over time using an input measure of time incurred to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Nelson Labs segment revenues are included in service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
We do not capitalize sales commissions because substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less. Furthermore, costs to fulfill a contract are not material.
Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, and other adjustments are provided for as reductions in net revenues in the period the related sale is recorded. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in net revenues, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of net revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from net revenue. 
Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.

Share-Based Compensation
 – Equity-based awards issued to employees under the Sotera Health Company 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”) include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options that vest over time. Prior to our initial public offering (the “IPO” as described in Note 14, “Stockholders' Equity”), equity-based awards were issued to employees and non-employee directors in the form of partnership interests in our predecessor, Sotera Health Topco Parent, L.P. (“Topco Parent”), which vested based on either time (“time vesting awards”) or the achievement of certain performance and market conditions (“performance awards” and, together with the time vesting awards, the “pre-IPO awards”). In connection with the IPO, Topco Parent made in-kind distributions of restricted shares of our common stock to holders of pre-IPO awards as described in Note 14, “Stockholders' Equity.” The restricted shares of our common stock distributed in respect of pre-IPO time vesting awards vest through June 2025; expense related to these unvested awards will be recognized over the remaining vesting period. Expense attributable to the performance awards was recognized in its entirety in the year ended December 31, 2020 as 
80

Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
the related performance conditions were considered probable of achievement and the implied service condition was met. Share-based compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), primarily within “Selling, general and administrative expenses” at the grant date fair value over the requisite service period (
one
 to 
four years
 for awards granted under the 2020 Plan and 
five years
 for time vesting pre-IPO awards on a straight-line basis). Fair value of the pre-IPO awards was estimated on the date of grant using a simulation-based option valuation model incorporating multiple and variable assumptions over time, including assumptions such as employee forfeitures, unit price volatility and dividend assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the grant date fair value of stock options awarded under the 2020 Plan using certain valuation assumptions. Share-based compensation expense for all awards recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
– In periods in which the Company has net income, earnings per share information is determined using the two-class method, which includes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and securities that participate in dividends (“participating securities”). Our unvested restricted common stock distributed in respect of partnership interests in Topco Parent (“pre-IPO Class B-1 restricted stock awards”)  has the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents if the Company declares dividends on its common stock. Under the two-class method, earnings are allocated to both common stock shares and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share incorporates the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on an average basis during the period, if dilutive, in which case the dilutive effect of such securities is calculated using the more dilutive of (a) the two-class method, or (b) treasury stock method, as applicable, to the potentially dilutive instruments. Unvested restricted common stock is not included in the weighted average common shares outstanding figure within earnings per share until the period in which the vesting condition is satisfied. In periods in which the Company has a net loss, the two-class method is not applicable because the pre-IPO Class B-1 restricted stock awards do not participate in losses. Refer to Note 16, “Earnings (Loss) Per Share” for additional information.
Treasury Stock
 – The Company records repurchases of its own common stock at cost. Repurchased common stock is presented as a reduction of equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. The difference between the repurchase and reissue price of the Company’s own stock is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital.
 The cost of Treasury Stock reissued is calculated using a weighted average cost method.
Commitments and Contingencies
 – Certain conditions may exist as of the date of the consolidated financial statements which may result in a loss to the Company but will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Such liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, settlement agreements, and other sources, are recorded when management assesses that it is probable that a future liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of costs from third parties, which management assesses as being probable of realization, are recorded to the extent related contingent liabilities are accrued. Legal costs incurred in connection with matters relating to contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. We record gain contingencies when realized.

Recent Accounting Standards
Adoption of Accounting Standard Updates
In the year ended December 31, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07-Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require an entity to provide enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. 
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
ASUs Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09-Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require entities to disclose, on an annual basis, specific categories in the reconciliation of the provision (benefit) for income taxes to the statutory rate and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally, the update requires entities to disclose a disaggregation of taxes paid by category (federal, state and foreign taxes) as well as individual jurisdictions. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on
 our consolidated financial statements and disclosures

(a)
Includes certain transportation certifications, a class 1B nuclear license and other intangibles related to obtaining such licensure. These assets are considered indefinite-lived as the decision for renewal by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is highly based on a licensee’s previous assessments, reported incidents, and annual compliance and inspection results. New applications for license can take a significant amount of time and cost; whereas an existing licensee with a historical record of compliance and current operating conditions more than likely ensures renewal for another 
10
 year license period as Nordion has demonstrated over its 75 years of history.
Amounts include the impact of foreign currency translation. Fully amortized amounts are written off.

Debt Facilities
Senior Secured Credit Facilities
On December 13, 2019, SHH, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into senior secured first lien credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), consisting of both a prepayable senior secured first lien term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to a first lien credit agreement (as amended through Amendment No. 4, the “Credit Agreement”). The total borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is $
423.8
 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide SHH the right at any time and under certain conditions to 
86
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
request incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit commitments based on a formula defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
On May 30, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 4 (“Amendment No. 4”) to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Among other changes, Amendment No. 4 provides for Refinancing Term Loans to SHH in an aggregate principal amount of $
1,509.4
 million. Pursuant to Amendment No. 4, the Refinancing Term Loans shall have an applicable interest rate margin per annum equal to (i) ABR plus 
2.25
% for ABR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) daily simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 
3.25
% for RFR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (iii) Term SOFR plus 
3.25
% for Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case with a 
0.00
% applicable floor and the applicable interest rate margin shall be subject to a pricing step-down of 
0.25
% when the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 
3.30
:1.00. The Refinancing Term Loans amortize at a rate of 
1.00
% per annum and mature on May 30, 2031. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Refinancing Term Loans for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
8.29
%.
On May 30, 2024, SHH, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, paying agent, registrar, transfer agent and notes collateral agent, entered into an Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing SHH’s $
750.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
7.375
% senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Secured Notes”) issued in May 2024. The Secured Notes will pay interest semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, at a rate of 
7.375
% per year, and will mature on June 1, 2031. The Secured Notes may be redeemed, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2027 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, the Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 
40
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 
107.375
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Further, at any time or from time to time, on or before June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 
10
% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) during each of the twelve-month periods ending after the issue date, at a redemption price equal to 
103
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The obligations under the Indenture are secured on a first-lien basis by security interests in substantially all of the assets of SHH, the Company and the Guarantors (other than any excluded assets) that secure the Credit Agreement on a pari passu basis, subject to certain limitations, exceptions and permitted liens. These obligations are secured pursuant to a security agreement, dated as of May 30, 2024, by and among SHH, the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the “Security Agreement”), as may be amended from time to time, and related financing statements. 
The Company used the combined net proceeds from the Refinancing Terms Loans and Secured Notes, along with cash on hand, to refinance its previously outstanding $
1,763.1
 million Term Loan due 2026 and $
496.3
 million Term Loan B due 2026.
On March 1, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No. 3”) to the Revolving Credit Facility. Among other changes, Amendment No. 3 provides (i) for new commitments under the existing Revolving Credit Facility to replace the existing revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $
83.0
 million, (ii) that certain of the lenders providing revolving credit commitments shall also provide additional commitments for the issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
37.5
 million and (iii) for the extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 1, 2029.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture contain additional covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and qualifications, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to engage in certain activities, such as incur additional indebtedness or permit to exist any lien on any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired, as specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including upon a change of control. In addition, an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture would occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries received one or more enforceable judgments for payment in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) $
162.6
 million or (ii) 
30.0
% of consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement and the Indenture, respectively) and the judgments were not stayed or remained undischarged for a period of 
60
 consecutive days. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. 
All of SHH’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Company, with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured by substantially all assets of SHH and the guarantors, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions and exclusions, as outlined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Indenture and the Security Agreement.
Outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by encumbrances against the Revolving Credit Facility and the collateral pledged thereunder, or by cash placed on deposit with the issuing bank. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
14.0
 million of letters of credit issued against the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in total availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of $
409.8
 million.
Term Loan Interest Rate Risk Management

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
164.1
 million and $
235.0
 million, respectively, which have no expiration date. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had available state net operating loss carryforwards of $
293.8
 million and $
298.8
 million, respectively, of which $
89.6
 million and $
103.6
 million

have no expiration date, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
21.4
 million and $
23.4
 million, respectively, the majority of which have no expiration date. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, a valuation allowance was established against foreign net operating loss carryforwards for $
3.6
 million and $
4.4
 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 there is 
no
 valuation allowance against U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards as we expect these deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2023 we established a valuation allowance against U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
6.8
 million. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also established a valuation allowance against U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards for $
12.5
 million and $
11.3
 million, respectively. Based on management’s assessment, it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income. 
At December 31, 2024, a deferred tax liability of $
3.8
 million was recorded for repatriation of earnings for purposes of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as these earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding accrued interest and penalties, was 
$
0
.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties as part of the provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions that were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) were not material.

Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company, which represents all of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local tax examinations before 2016, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. Tax years through December 31, 2018 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service and are effectively closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes and no other fiscal years are currently under audit. For Nordion’s Canadian tax, all tax years through October 31, 2018 have been closed through audit or statute, and no other fiscal years are currently under audit. 
A portion of the Company’s foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2030. This tax holiday may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this holiday was $
1.3
 million and $
1.1
 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Employee Benefits
Employee Retirement Benefits in the U.S.
We have a defined-contribution retirement plan that covers all U.S. employees upon date of hire. Contributions are directed by each participant into various investment options. Under this plan, we match participants’ contributions based on plan provisions. The Company’s contributions, which are expensed as incurred, were $
6.0
 million, $
5.7
 million, and $
5.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are recorded in the same line as the respective employee’s wages. Administrative expenses related to the plan are paid by the Company and are not material. 
Employee Retirement Benefits Outside the U.S.
The Company participates in qualified supplemental retirement and savings plans in various countries outside the U.S. where we operate. Under these defined-contribution plans, funding and costs are generally based upon a predetermined percentage of employee compensation. The Company’s contributions, which are expensed as incurred and recorded in the same line as the respective employee’s wages, were $
1.7
 million, $
1.7
 million and $
1.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The Company also sponsors various post-employment benefit plans including, in certain countries outside the U.S., defined benefit and defined contribution plans, retirement compensation arrangements, and plans that provide extended health care coverage to retired employees, the majority of which relate to Nordion.
Defined benefit pension plan 
The following defined benefit pension plan disclosure relates to Nordion. Certain immaterial foreign defined benefit pension plans have been excluded from the table below. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of net actuarial loss are recorded in “Other (income) expense, net” and the service cost component is included in the same financial statement line item as the applicable employee’s wages in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans, which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation, within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. Such investment strategies have adopted an equity-based philosophy to achieve their long-term investment goals by investing in assets that often have uncertain returns, such as Canadian and other foreign equities, and non-government bonds, although the Company also attempts to reduce the overall level of risk by diversifying the asset classes and further diversifying within each individual asset class. 
The Company’s expected return on asset assumptions are derived from studies conducted by actuaries and investment advisors. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study considers recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.
Valuation Methodologies
Below is a description of the composition and valuation methodologies for pension plan assets. Refer to the discussion of fair value hierarchy in Note 20, “Financial Instruments and Financial Risk.” 
Cash and cash equivalents
 – Consists of deposits with financial institutions and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are categorized as Level 1 instruments in the fair value hierarchy.

The Company currently has no funding requirements as the Nordion pension plan had a going concern surplus as of January 1, 2024, as defined by Canadian federal regulations, which require solvency testing on defined benefit pension plans on an annual basis. 
The Company may obtain a qualifying letter of credit for solvency payments, up to 
15
% of the market value of solvency liabilities as determined on the valuation date, instead of cash payment into the pension fund. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding relating to the defined benefit plans totaling $
6.4
 million and $
16.0
 million, respectively. The actual funding requirements over the 
five-year
 period will be dependent on subsequent annual actuarial valuations. These amounts are estimates, which may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in Canadian government regulations, and any voluntary contributions.

Stockholders’ Equity 
Common Stock
The Company completed its IPO in the fourth quarter of 2020 and shares began trading on Nasdaq on November 20, 2020. Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to authorize 
1,200,000,000
 shares of common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, and reclassify all 
3,000
 shares of its common stock then outstanding as 
232,400,200
 shares. Upon completion of the IPO, 
284,421,755
 shares of common stock were outstanding.

Share-Based Compensation 
Pre-IPO Awards
Prior to our IPO, the Company’s equity-based awards issued to service providers (including directors and employees) included partnership interests in Topco Parent (Class B-1 or B-2 Units) which vested based on either time or the achievement of certain performance and market conditions (the “pre-IPO awards”). These equity-based awards represented an interest in our former parent and were granted in respect of services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries. In connection with the IPO, our former parent made in-kind distributions of shares of our common stock to its limited partners. At the time of the IPO, there were fewer than 60 individuals who received shares in the in-kind distribution; while this distribution represented a modification to the existing awards, there was no associated change in compensation expense because the fair value of the distributed shares immediately before and after the distribution was the same. 
Restricted stock distributed in respect of pre-IPO Class B-1 time vesting units vests on a daily basis pro rata over a 
five-year
 vesting period (
20
% per year) beginning on the original vesting commencement date of the corresponding Class B-1 time vesting units, subject to the grantee’s continued services through each vesting date. Upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company, all then outstanding unvested shares of our common stock distributed in respect of Class B-1 Units will vest as of the date of consummation of such change in control, subject to the grantee’s continued services through the consummation of the change in control.
Restricted stock distributed in respect of pre-IPO Class B-2 Units were considered performance vesting units. The required performance threshold for the vesting of B-2 restricted stock was the first date on which (i) our Sponsors received actual cash proceeds in an amount equal to or in excess of at least two and one-half times their invested capital in Topco Parent (of which the Company was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary prior to the IPO) and (ii) the Sponsors’ internal rate of return exceeded 
20
%, subject to such grantee’s continued services through such date. Both performance thresholds were satisfied on March 4, 2024 and, as a result, all outstanding B-2 Units were fully vested as of that date. Share-based compensation expense attributed to the pre-IPO Class B-2 awards was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the related performance conditions were considered probable of achievement and the implied service conditions were met. 
We recognized $
1.6
 million, $
2.0
 million and $
2.1
 million of share-based compensation expense related to the pre-IPO Class B-1 awards for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan
We maintain the 2020 Plan that allows for grants of incentive stock options to employees (including employees of any of our subsidiaries), nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), RSUs and other cash-based, equity-based or equity-related awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees or consultants of our subsidiaries. A maximum of 
27.9
 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2020 Plan. At December 31, 2024, 
15.6
 million
 shares were available for future issuance. The Company plans to issue shares available under t

Plan or shares from treasury to satisfy requirements of awards paid with shares.

Stock Options
We use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. Since we are a newly public company, the expected volatility is based on the volatility of similar publicly traded businesses within the same or similar industry as the Company in combination with our own volatility. We used the simplified method to estimate the expected term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant. 
Weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options and the assumptions used in estimating the fair values are as follows:

Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
Basic earnings per share represents the amount of income attributable to each common share outstanding. Diluted earnings per share represents the amount of income attributable to each common share outstanding adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include stock options and other stock-based awards. In the periods where the effect would be antidilutive, potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
.
In periods in which the Company has net income, earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method. This method is required as unvested restricted stock distributed in respect of pre-IPO Class B-1 and B-2 awards have the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents if the Company were to declare dividends on its common stock. Pursuant to the two-class method, earnings for each period are allocated on a pro-rata basis to common stockholders and unvested pre-IPO Class B-1 and B-2 restricted stock awards. As of March 4, 2024, the performance threshold applicable to all Class B-2 restricted stock awards were fully satisfied, thereby releasing the vesting and forfeiture restrictions on these common shares. Beginning on that date, B-2 restricted stock was not included in the earnings allocation. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the more dilutive of (a) the two-class method, or (b) treasury stock method, as applicable, to the potentially dilutive instruments.
Our

basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share are calculated as follows:

Asset Retirement Obligations (“ARO”) 
Our ARO represent the present value of future remediation costs and an increase in the carrying amounts of the related assets in property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The capitalized future site remediation costs are depreciated and the ARO are accreted over the life of the related assets which is included in depreciation and amortization expense within cost of revenues, respectively.
The fair value of the ARO is determined based on estimates requiring management judgment. Key assumptions include the timing and estimated decommissioning costs of the remediation activities and credit adjusted risk free interest rates. Changes in the assumptions based on future information may result in adjustments to the estimated obligations over time. No market risk premium has been included in the calculation for the ARO since no reliable estimate can be made by the Company. Any difference between costs incurred upon settlement of an ARO and the liability recognized for the estimated cost of asset retirements will be recognized as a gain or loss in our current period operating results. 
Each year, we review decommissioning costs and consider changes in marketplace rates. 
The following table describes changes to our ARO liability during the years presented:

Commitments and Continge
ncies
We depend on a limited number of suppliers and our agreements with these suppliers account for material portions of our
supply and direct material costs. These costs include obligations under various supply agreements in our Nordion segment for
Co-60 that are enforceable and legally binding on us. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had minimum purchase commitments
primarily with domestic and international suppliers of raw materials for the Nordion business totaling 
$
2,219.1
 million
. The
terms of these long-term supply or service arrangements range from 1 to 39 years. In addition, our Sterigenics segment has
obligations to purchase ethylene oxide (“EO”). Our contract to purchase EO in the U.S. requires us to purchase all of our
requirements from one supplier, and our contracts to purchase EO outside the U.S. generally require that we purchase a
specified percentage of our requirements for our operations in the countries covered by those contracts. We expect to utilize the
Co-60 and EO encompassed by these agreements in the normal course of our business and therefore our commitments under
these agreements are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability.
From time to time, we may be or are subject to various lawsuits and other claims, as well as gain contingencies, in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. We assess these regulatory and legal actions to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making these determinations, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts.
We establish reserves for specific liabilities in connection with regulatory and legal actions that we determine to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The outcomes of regulatory and legal actions can be difficult to predict and are often resolved over long periods of time, making our probability and estimability determinations highly judgmental. Probability determinations require the analysis of various possible outcomes, assessments of potential damages and the impact of multiple factors beyond our control, including potential actions by others, interpretations of the law, and changes and developments in relevant facts, circumstances, regulations and other laws. If a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability is disclosed, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if the range is determinable and material. In certain of the matters described below, we are not able to estimate potential liability because of the uncertainties related to the outcome(s) and/or the amount(s) or range(s) of loss. The ultimate resolution of pending regulatory and legal matters in future periods, including the matters described below, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. The Company may also incur material defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
Ethylene Oxide Tort Litigation
Sterigenics U.S., LLC (“Sterigenics”) and other medical supply sterilization companies have been subjected to tort lawsuits alleging various injuries caused by low-level environmental exposure to EO used at or emitted from sterilization facilities. Those lawsuits, as detailed further below, are individual claims, as opposed to class actions.
California
As of December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company and other parties were defendants in 
four
 lawsuits in Los Angeles County Superior Court in which the plaintiffs are asserting 
33
 claims for personal injuries and wrongful death allegedly resulting from emissions and releases of EO from Sterigenics’ Vernon facilities (the “Vernon Cases”). The Vernon Cases have been assigned to one judge and discovery is underway.
We are vigorously defending the Vernon Cases.
Georgia
Subsidiaries of the Company and other parties are defendants in lawsuits in Georgia in which plaintiffs allege personal injuries, wrongful death and property devaluation resulting from use, emissions and releases of EO from or at Sterigenics’ Atlanta facility (the “Atlanta Cases”).
104
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company and other parties were defendants in 
313
 personal injury and wrongful death claims in the State Court of Cobb County (the “Georgia Trial Court”) and 
312
 of the claims have been consolidated for pretrial purposes (the “Consolidated Personal Injury Cases”). The Consolidated Personal Injury Cases are governed by a case management order pursuant to which general causation issues in a pool of 
eight
 cases are to be adjudicated in Phase 1 and specific causation issues in the pool cases are to be adjudicated in Phase 2; the remaining Consolidated Personal Injury Cases (including 
ten
 cases that include both personal injury and property claims) are stayed. On November 22, 2024, the Georgia Trial Court issued a Phase 1 ruling on general causation issues granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motions to exclude certain Phase 1 expert testimony and defendants’ motions for summary judgment on Phase 1 issues (the “Phase 1 Ruling”). Both plaintiffs and defendants appealed the Phase 1 Ruling and these appeals are pending before the Georgia Court of Appeals. Phase 2 discovery in the pool cases is scheduled to take place through May 2025. 
One
 lawsuit has not been consolidated and the parties have jointly requested the Georgia Trial Court to stay the case along with the stayed cases in the Consolidated Personal Injury Cases.
As of December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company and other parties were also defendants in a lawsuit pending in the Georgia Trial Court in which employees of a sterilization customer of Sterigenics allege they were injured while working at the customer’s distribution facility by exposure to residual EO allegedly emanating from products of the customer that had been sterilized by Sterigenics. Pursuant to the customer’s contract with Sterigenics, the customer is indemnifying Sterigenics against this lawsuit and discovery is underway.
As of December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company were also defendants in 
345
 property devaluation lawsuits pending in the Georgia Trial Court that have been consolidated for pretrial purposes (the “Consolidated Property Cases”). A pool of 
nine
 of the Consolidated Property Cases are proceeding under case management orders and the remaining cases are stayed.
We are vigorously defending the Atlanta Cases.
Illinois
As of December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company and other parties were defendants in 
96
 lawsuits in Illinois in which plaintiffs allege personal injuries or wrongful deaths resulting from purported emissions and releases of EO from Sterigenics’ former Willowbrook facility (the “Willowbrook Cases”). The Willowbrook Cases are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County and have been assigned to a single judge for coordinated discovery and pretrial proceedings. 
Two
 of the Willowbrook Cases are set for trial in April 2025 and 
five
 of the Willowbrook Cases are set for trial in June 2025.
We are vigorously defending the Willowbrook Cases. 
New Mexico
The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in a lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court, Doña Ana County, New Mexico in which the New Mexico Attorney General (“NMAG”) alleges that emissions and releases of EO from Sterigenics’ facility in Santa Teresa have deteriorated the air quality in surrounding communities and materially contributed to increased health risks for residents of those communities. In April 2024, the Court of Appeals of the State of New Mexico denied the NMAG’s petition for leave to file an interlocutory appeal of an August 2023 order granting Sterigenics’ motion for summary judgment on strict liability, the Unfair Practices Act claim, and the claims for decreased property values, increased healthcare costs and medical monitoring costs. The case has been remanded to the District Court of Doña Ana County for further proceedings on the remaining claims. The case is set for trial in July 2026.
We are vigorously defending the NMAG’s remaining claims.

Additional EO lawsuits have been threatened relating to Sterigenics’ former facility in Willowbrook and existing facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Grand Prairie, Texas; and Vernon, California and may be filed in the future relating to these or Sterigenics’ other EO facilities; these threats of additional EO lawsuits are comparable to threats that have 
105
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
similarly been made against other companies within our industry. Based on our view of the strength of the science and related evidence that emissions of EO from Sterigenics’ operations have not caused and could not have caused the harms alleged in such lawsuits, we believe that losses in the remaining or future EO cases through trials and any appeals that may prove necessary are not probable. Although the Company is vigorously defending against the EO tort claims, future settlements of EO tort claims are reasonably possible. The previously disclosed settlements of certain cases related to our facilities in Willowbrook and Atlanta Settlements and the resolution of the tort lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico (as previously disclosed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024) were driven by dynamics unique to the claims that were settled and thus should not give rise to presumptions that the Company will settle additional EO tort claims and/or that any such settlements will be for comparable amounts.
Potential trial and settlement outcomes can vary widely based on a host of factors. EO tort lawsuits will be presided over by different judges, tried by different counsel presenting different evidence and decided by different juries. The substantive and procedural laws of jurisdictions vary and can meaningfully impact the litigation process and outcome of a case. Each plaintiff’s claim involves unique facts and evidence including the circumstances of the plaintiff’s alleged exposure, the type and severity of the plaintiff’s disease, the plaintiff’s medical history and course of treatment, the location of and other factors related to the plaintiff’s real property, and other circumstances. The outcomes of trials before juries are rarely certain and a judgment rendered or settlement reached in one case is not necessarily representative of potential outcomes of other seemingly comparable cases. As a result, it is not possible to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss with respect to any future EO tort lawsuit, trial or settlement.
Insurance Coverage for Environmental Liabilities
An environmental liability insurance policy under which we have received coverage for the EO tort lawsuits in Georgia, Illinois and New Mexico described above had limits of $
10.0
 million per occurrence and $
20.0
 million in the aggregate. Those per occurrence and aggregate limits were fully utilized in the defense of the Georgia, Illinois and New Mexico litigation. Our insurance for future alleged environmental liabilities excludes coverage for EO claims.
We are pursuing additional insurance coverage for our legal expenses related to EO tort lawsuits. In 2021, Sterigenics filed an insurance coverage lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Illinois District Court”) relating to two commercial general liability policies issued in the 1980s (the “Northern District of Illinois Coverage Lawsuit”). The Illinois District Court issued an order declaring that the defendant insurer owes a duty to Sterigenics and another insured party to defend the Willowbrook Cases (the “Duty to Defend Order”) and entered judgment for Sterigenics in January 2024 in the amount of $
110.2
 million for certain defense costs incurred in the Willowbrook Cases as of August 2022 (the “Defense Costs Judgment”). The defendant insurer has appealed the Duty to Defend Order and Defense Costs Judgment; briefing is complete, and oral argument was held before the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on September 25, 2024.
Sterigenics is also a party in insurance coverage lawsuits pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, the Delaware Superior Court and the Los Angeles County Superior Court relating to insurance coverage from various historical commercial general liability policies for certain EO litigation settlement amounts and defense costs that the insurer against which a judgment has been secured in the Northern District of Illinois Coverage Lawsuit may fail to fund. The Delaware Superior Court case is stayed pending resolution of the coverage lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County and the Los Angeles County Superior Court case remains in preliminary stages. It is not possible to predict how much, if any, of the insurance proceeds sought will ultimately be recovered.
Sotera Health Company Securities Litigation and Related Matters
In January 2023, a stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio 
(the “Ohio District Court”) 
against the Company, certain past and present directors and senior executives, the Company’s private equity stockholders and the underwriters of the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 2020 and the Company’s secondary public offering (“SPO”) in March 2021 (the “Michigan Funds Litigation”). In April 2023, the 
Ohio District Court
 appointed the Oakland County Employees’ Retirement System, Oakland County Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association, and Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System (the “Michigan Funds”) to serve as lead plaintiff to prosecute claims on behalf of a proposed class of stockholders who acquired shares of the Company in connection with our IPO or SPO between November 20, 2020 and September 19, 2022 (the “Proposed Class”). The Michigan Funds allege that certain 
106
Table of Contents
Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
statements made regarding the safety of the Company’s use of EO and/or the EO tort lawsuits and other risks of its EO operations violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (when made in the registration statements for the IPO and SPO) and Sections 10(b), Section 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (when made in subsequent securities filings and other contexts). Defendants have moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint, and that motion remains pending.
In May 2024, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Chancery Court”) for the benefit of the Company as the nominal defendant (the “May 2024 Derivative Litigation”). The plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties, insider trading, unjust enrichment and other violations by certain past and present directors and senior executives of the Company and the Company’s private equity stockholders. On June 25, 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed the May 2024 Derivative Litigation pending a ruling on the merits on the motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint in the Michigan Funds Litigation.
The Company is vigorously defending the Michigan Funds Litigation and, if necessary, plans to vigorously defend the May 2024 Derivative Litigation
.
The Company has also received demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 for inspections of its books and records (“220 Demands”) from shareholders purporting to investigate potential wrongdoing by Company fiduciaries and other issues relating to the Company’s statements regarding the safety of its use of EO and/or the EO tort lawsuits and other risks of its EO operations. The Company has produced documents in response to the 220 Demands and may produce additional documents.

Financial Instruments and Financial Risk 
Derivative Instruments 
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives. 
Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships
From time to time, the Company utilizes interest rate derivatives designated in hedge relationships to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings. These instruments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
In March 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $
400.0
 million. The interest rate swap was effective on August 23, 2023 and expires on August 23, 2025. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the SOFR benchmark interest rate of our Term Loan (or any successor thereto). We receive interest at the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay a fixed interest rate under the terms of the swap agreement.
In May 2022, we entered into 
two
 interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of $
1,000.0
 million for a total option premium of $
4.1
 million. The interest rate caps were effective on July 31, 2023 and expired on July 31, 2024. We designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate of our Term Loan (or any successor thereto). Under the current terms of the loan agreement, the benchmark interest rate index transitioned from LIBOR to the Term SOFR on June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the interest rate cap agreements hedged the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in SOFR by limiting our cash flow exposure related to Term SOFR under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to 
3.5
%.
In October 2021, we entered into 
two
 interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of $
1,000.0
 million for a total option premium of $
1.8
 million. Both interest rate caps were effective on December 31, 2022 and expired on July 31, 2023. These interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges and were designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in LIBOR (or its successor), the benchmark interest rate being hedged, by limiting our cash flow exposure related to the LIBOR base rate under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to 
1.0
%.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships
Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage economic risks associated with our variable rate borrowings that are not designated in hedge relationships. These instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any changes in the value being recorded in “Interest expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
The Company also routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk of our intercompany loans in certain of our international subsidiaries and non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency forward contracts expire on a monthly basis. 
Embedded Derivatives
We have embedded derivatives in certain of our customer and supply contracts as a result of the currency of the contract being different from the functional currency of the parties involved. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recognized in “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Sotera Health Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We expect to reclassify approximately $
0.5
 million of after-tax net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to income during the next 12 months associated with our cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 13, “Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” for unrealized gains on interest rate derivatives, net of applicable tax, recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense, net of applicable tax, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Credit Risk 
Certain of our financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are exposed to credit risk. 
We are also exposed, in our normal course of business, to credit risk from our customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivable was net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $
2.5
 million and $
4.7
 million, respectively. 
Credit risk on financial instruments arises from the potential for counterparties to default on their contractual obligations to us. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance, but do not anticipate non-performance by any of the counterparties to our financial instruments. We limit our credit risk by dealing with counterparties that are considered to be of high credit quality. In the event of non-performance by counterparties, the carrying value of our financial instruments represents the maximum amount of loss that would be incurred. 
Our credit team evaluates and regularly monitors changes in the credit risk of our customers. We routinely assess the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an adequate allowance for uncollectible accounts to address potential credit losses. The process includes a review of customer financial information and credit ratings, current market conditions as well as the expected future economic conditions that may impact the collection of trade receivables. We regularly review our customers’ past due amounts through an analysis of aged accounts receivables, specific customer past due aging amounts, and the history of trade receivables written off. Upon concluding that a receivable balance is not collectible, the balance is written off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts.
Fair Value Hierarchy 
The fair value of our financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The valuation techniques we would use to determine such fair values are described as follows: Level 1—fair values determined by inputs utilizing quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2—fair values based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable; Level 3—fair values determined by unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Interest rate caps and swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate observable market inputs including interest rate curves and yield curves. Additional information is provided in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies.”
(b)
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Refer also to Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Embedded derivatives are valued using internally developed models that rely on observable market inputs, including foreign currency forward curves. Foreign currency forward contracts are valued by reference to changes in foreign currency exchange rate over the life of the contract. 
(c)
Carrying amounts of current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt instruments are reported net of discounts and debt issuance costs. The estimated fair value of these instruments are based upon quoted prices for each Term Loan and the Secured Notes in inactive markets as provided by an independent fixed income security pricing service.

Segment and Geographic Information 
We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage, evaluate and internally report our business activities for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. We have 
three
 reportable segments: Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs. We have determined our reportable segments based upon an assessment of organizational structure, service types, and internally prepared financial statements. Our chief operating decision maker, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sotera Health Company (“CODM”), evaluates performance and allocates resources based on segment income after the elimination of intercompany activities. The CODM uses these performance measures to inform decisions about the operations of the business and dedication of resources to selling and general administrative matters pertinent to the Company. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, the Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is included in this Item 9A below.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the fourth quarter of 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Sotera Health Company
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Sotera Health Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Sotera Health Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
