CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “may,” “intends,” “plans” or “anticipates,” or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from historical results or any future results, performance or achievements expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to:
•
a disruption in the availability or supply of, or increases in the price of, ethylene oxide (“EO”), Cobalt-60 (“Co-60”) or our other direct materials, services and supplies, including as a result of geopolitical instability and/or sanctions against Russia by the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and/or the European Union;
•
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•
evolving changes in environmental, health and safety regulations;
•
health and safety risks associated with the use, storage, transportation and disposal of potentially hazardous materials such as EO and Co-60;
•
the impact and outcome of current and future legal proceedings and liability claims, including litigation related to the use, emissions and releases of EO from our facilities in California, Georgia, Illinois and New Mexico and the possibility that other claims will be made in the future relating to these or other facilities;
•
allegations of our failure to properly perform services and potential product liability claims, recalls, penalties and reputational harm;
•
compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements to which we are subject, the related costs, and any failures to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, required clearances or approvals;
•
adverse changes in industry trends;
•
competition we face;
•
market conditions and changes, including inflationary trends, that impact our long-term supply contracts with variable price clauses and increase our cost of revenues;
•
business continuity hazards, including supply chain disruptions and other risks associated with our operations;
•
the risks of doing business internationally, including global and regional economic and political instability and compliance with various applicable laws and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions;
•
our ability to increase capacity at existing facilities, build new facilities in a timely and cost-effective manner and renew leases for our leased facilities;
•
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees;
•
severe health events or environmental events;
•
cybersecurity incidents, unauthorized data disclosures, and our dependence on information technology systems;
•
an inability to pursue strategic transactions, find suitable acquisition targets, or integrate strategic acquisitions into our business successfully;
•
our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
•
our reliance on intellectual property to maintain our competitive position and the risk of claims from third parties that we have infringed or misappropriated, or are infringing or misappropriating, their intellectual property rights;
•
our ability to comply with rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions and any ineffective compliance efforts with such laws and regulations;
•
our ability to generate profitability in future periods;
•
impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, as well as other long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives;
•
the effects of unionization efforts and labor regulations in countries in which we operate;
•
adverse changes to our tax positions in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions or the interpretation and application of recent U.S. tax legislation or other changes in U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of our operations; and
•
our significant leverage and how this significant leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to challenges confronting our Company or broader changes in our industry or the economy, limit our flexibility in operating our business through restrictions contained in our debt agreements and/or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness.
