Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters is in Broadview Heights, Ohio, our Sterigenics headquarters is in Oakbrook, Illinois, our Nelson Labs headquarters is in Taylorsville, Utah and our Nordion headquarters is in Kanata, Ontario. As of December 31, 2024, we operated 62 facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The following table identified the number of owned and leased facilities, other than our headquarters listed above. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate our operations.
