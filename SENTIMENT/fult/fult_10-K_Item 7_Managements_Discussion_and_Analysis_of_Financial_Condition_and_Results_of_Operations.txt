Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management's Discussion relates to the Corporation, a financial holding company registered under the BHCA and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Management's Discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
The Corporation is a financial holding company, which, through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, provides a full range of consumer and commercial financial services in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. 
The Corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or increasing the NIM, which is FTE net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets, such as loans, investments and properties. Offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans and OBS credit risks, non-interest expenses and income taxes.

Acquisition of Substantially all of the Assets and Assumption of Substantially all of the Deposits and Certain Liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC
On the Acquisition Date, Fulton Bank acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. As part of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank acquired approximately $4.8 billion of assets of Republic First Bank and assumed approximately $5.6 billion of liabilities of Republic First Bank. The Bank received approximately $0.8 billion of cash from the FDIC in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 
As a result of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank enhanced its presence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
In connection with the Republic First Transaction, Fulton Bank made a $5.0 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation to provide additional impact grants to nonprofit community organizations across the region that share the Bank’s vision of advancing economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities.
37
During the fourth quarter of 2024, as part of the Bank's Republic First Transaction integration, the Corporation closed 13 of the Bank's financial center locations and consolidated the operations of those locations into nearby financial center locations operated by the Bank. The premises and equipment of the 13 locations included five locations owned by the Bank and eight locations leased by the Bank. The Corporation recorded pre-tax costs of approximately $9.8 million reflected in acquisition-related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024, consisting of write-offs of premises and equipment and related expenses, severance expenses and lease termination charges.

See "Note 2 - Business Combinations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, "Item 1. Financial Statements."
Common Stock Offering
On May 1, 2024, the Corporation completed its underwritten public offering of 19,166,667 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. The net proceeds to the Corporation from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses were approximately $272.6 million.
Sale-Leaseback Transaction
On May 10, 2024, the Bank and Fulton Financial Realty Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, entered into the Sale-Leaseback Transaction and received an aggregate cash purchase price of $55.4 million. The Bank leased each of the locations sold in the Sale-Leaseback Transaction for an initial term of 15 years, with the option to extend the term of each for up to three successive terms of up to five years each. The Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain, after deduction of transaction-related expenses, of approximately $20.3 million in connection with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction during the second quarter of 2024. See "Note 18 - Leases" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements."
Securities Restructuring
In May 2024, the Corporation sold approximately $345.7 million AFS securities and recorded a pre-tax loss of $20.3 million during the second quarter of 2024. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested into higher-yielding securities of a similar type and similar duration. 
Borrowings
In November 2024, the Corporation retired $168.8 million of subordinated notes issued in November 2014 and June 2015 which matured on November 15, 2024. See "Note 10 - Borrowings" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements."

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Based Financial Measures
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains supplemental financial information, as detailed below, that has been derived by methods other than GAAP. The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results. Investors should recognize that the Corporation's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and the Corporation strongly encourages a review of its consolidated financial statements in their entirety. 
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure follow:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a summary of those accounting policies that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, because they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See additional information regarding these critical accounting policies in "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Allowance for Credit Losses
 - The ACL is based on estimated losses over the remaining expected life of loans. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the reserve is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, current and forecasted economic factors and other relevant factors. 
Loans Evaluated Collectively
: Loans evaluated collectively for expected credit losses include all accruing loans and non-accrual loans where the total commitment amount is less than $1 million. In determining the ACL, the Corporation uses three inputs to model the estimate. These inputs are the PD rate which estimates the likelihood that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations, the LGD rate which estimates the percentage of an asset that is lost if a borrower defaults, and the EAD balance which estimates the gross exposure under a facility upon default. The PD models were developed based on historical default data. Both internal and external variables are evaluated in the process. The main internal variables are risk rating or delinquency history and indicators of default. The external variables are economic variables obtained from third-party forecasts. 
The PD models are transition matrix models that utilize historical credit observations and incorporate economic forecasts to project future default rates using a linear regression methodology for each loan segment. The LGD model uses a vintage loss approach that estimates LGD rates based on the bank’s historical loss experience for each loan segment. The EAD incorporates a prepayment rate and applies the PD rates to estimate the projected exposure at default across the life of each loan. The ACL is calculated by applying the LGD to the EAD at each period across the life of each loan. 
The ACL incorporates the Corporation’s historical credit observations, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that are statistically correlated with historical PD rates. The reasonable and supportable forecast extends to 24 months and reverts back to an average PD rate using a straight-line reversion methodology over a 12 month period. 

41
The ACL is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the reserve. As such, the calculation of the ACL is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise judgment. 
The ACL may include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative models. In determining qualitative adjustments, management considers changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and their impact on the lending environment, including underwriting standards and other factors affecting credit losses over the remaining life of each loan. 
The ACL for loans was $379.2 million and $293.4 million on December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The increase of $85.8 million was primarily a result of the Republic First Transaction, which included $54.6 million for PCD Loans and $23.4 million recorded through the provision for credit losses at the Acquisition Date for non-PCD Loans. 
The Corporation performs loan loss sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis to determine the impact of varying economic conditions based on third-p
arty forecasts. Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management's view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. One scenario identified includes a highly adverse economic environment. This scenario resulted in a hypothetical increase to the ACL of approximately $39.5 million.
For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the ACL, refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Income Taxes
 - Income tax expense is based upon income before taxes, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses and credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. DTAs or deferred tax liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.
The Corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that DTAs will be recovered through future taxable income. If any such assets are determined to be more likely than not unrecoverable, then a valuation allowance must be recognized. The assessment of the carrying value of DTAs is based on certain assumptions, the changes of which could have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.
On a periodic basis, the Corporation evaluates its income tax expense based on tax laws, regulations and financial reporting considerations and records adjustments as appropriate. Recognition and measurement of tax positions is based upon management's evaluations of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Corporation's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions and the overall tax environment. 
Income tax expense was $55.9 million and $64.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
FTE net interest income was $978.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $106.1 million, compared to $872.1 million for the same period in 2023. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NIM was 3.42%. The Corporation manages the risk associated with changes in interest rates through the techniques described within Item "7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." The following table provides a comparative average balance sheet and net interest income analysis for 2024 compared to 2023 and 2022. Interest income and yields are presented on an FTE basis using a 21% federal tax rate as well as statutory interest expense disallowances. The discussion following this table is based on these tax-equivalent amounts.

Compared to 2023, FTE total interest income for 2024 increased $309.1 million due to increases of $144.0 million attributable to changes in yield and $165.0 million attributable to changes in volume. The increase due to changes in yield was largely due to an increase in net loans. The increase due to changes in volume was due to an increase in average net loans.
The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 54 bps in 2024 compared to 2023.
In 2024, interest expense increased $202.9 million compared to 2023, primarily driven by an increase in rate on interest-bearing liabilities resulting in a $124.5 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense attributable to rate was driven by increases in interest-bearing demand deposits, savings and money market deposits and time deposits. The increase in interest expense attributable to volume was $78.4 million primarily driven by increases in time deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities.  
The rate on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 58 bps in 2024 compared to 2023.

During 2024, average net loans increased $2.2 billion, or 10.6%, compared to 2023. The increase in average net loans was primarily due to approximately $2.4 billion of total loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. Overall, the increase in average net loans was largely driven by increases in average commercial mortgage loans, average residential mortgage loans and average commercial and industrial loans of $1.2 billion, $846.0 million and $182.5 million, respectively. The yield on total loans increased 51 bps to 6.08% in 2024 compared to 5.57% in 2023.

The cost of total deposits increased 75 bps to 2.13% in 2024 compared to 1.38% in 2023, primarily due to rising interest rates and a change in mix of deposits. Average deposits increased $3.4 billion, or 16.0%, compared to 2023. The increase in average total deposits was primarily due to approximately $3.7 billion of total deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The increase in average deposits occurred primarily in average time deposits, average interest-bearing demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits, which increased $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $748.0 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $545.3 million.

Average borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased $490.9 million during 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in average borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in federal funds purchased and average FHLB advances of $515.1 million and $117.8 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in average other interest-bearing liabilities of $167.6 million.  
In November 2024, the Corporation retired $168.8 million of subordinated notes issued in November 2014 and June 2015 which matured on November 15, 2024. 
See "Note 10 - Borrowings" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses was $71.6 million in 2024 compared to $54.0 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Republic First Transaction, which included a provision for credit losses of $23.4 million for non-PCD Loans, partially offset 
45
by an elevated level of provision for credit losses in the same period in 2023 due to a $13.3 million charge-off for a commercial office loan.

Non-interest income before investment securities losses and gain on acquisition, net of tax increased $30.6 million, or 13.4%, during 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in non-interest income was partially due to $7.7 million from acquired operations in the Republic First Transaction. The remaining increase of $22.9 million included a $9.2 million increase in wealth management revenues due to an increase in assets under management, a $4.3 million increase in cash management fee income due to an increase in account analysis fees with customers electing to move funds to interest-bearing deposit accounts, a $3.6 million increase in mortgage banking income primarily due to higher loan volumes and spreads, a $1.8 million increase in SBA income largely due to higher loan sale volumes, a $1.6 million increase in income from bank owned life insurance and a $1.7 million increase in debit card fee income.
In May 2024, the Corporation sold $345.7 million of AFS securities and recorded a pre-tax loss of $20.3 million. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested into higher yielding securities of a similar type and similar duration.

Non-interest expense in 2024 increased $140.6 million, or 20.7%, compared to 2023. Excluding the gain on the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, acquisition-related expenses and FultonFirst implementation and asset disposal costs, non-interest expense increased $94.4 million, or 14.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to $71.9 million from acquired operations in the Republic First Transaction, including $15.7 million of CDI amortization expense, and $21.5 million in salaries and benefits expense driven by annual merit increases, higher incentive compensation expense and lower deferred costs from loan origination activities.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense for 2024 was $55.9 million, an $8.6 million decrease compared to 2023. The Corporation's ETR was 16.2% in 2024. Excluding the impact from the $37.0 million gain on acquisition, net of tax, the Corporation's ETR was 18.2%  compared to 18.5% in 2023. The decrease in income tax expense in 2024 resulted primarily from the lower ETR. The ETR is generally lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax-exempt interest income earned on loans, investments in tax-free municipal securities and TCIs that generate tax credits under various federal programs.

Compared to 2022, FTE total interest income for 2023 increased $411.2 million due to increases of $344.7 million attributable to changes in yield and $66.5 million attributable to changes in volume. The increase due to changes in yield was largely due to
an increase in net loans. The increase due to changes in volume was due to an increase in average net loans, partially offset by decreases in average other interest-earning assets and investment securities.
The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 145 bps in 2023 compared to 2022.
In 2023, interest expense increased $335.7 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by an increase in rate on interest-bearing
liabilities resulting in a $252.9 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense attributable to rate was driven by the increases in savings and money market deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, time deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities and brokered deposits. The increase in interest expense attributable to volume was $82.9 million, primarily driven by increases in borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities and brokered deposits.

Non-interest income before investment securities gains (losses) increased $1.3 million, or 0.6%, during 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increases in commercial banking revenues of $5.4 million, largely driven by an increase in commercial customer interest rate swap fee income reflected in capital markets, an increase in wealth management of $2.7 million, due to an increase in assets under management, and an increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance agreements of $1.7 million, reflected in other non-interest income, partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking income of $3.8 million, mainly due to lower sales volumes and lower gains on sales margins, consumer banking income of $2.3 million, driven largely by decreases in overdraft fees, and a $1.8 million reduction in other non-interest income to reflect market valuation movement in certain of the Corporation's legacy commercial customer back-to-back interest rate swap transactions resulting from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.

Non-interest expense in 2023 increased $45.5 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2022. Excluding acquisition-related expenses of $10.3 million in 2022 and FultonFirst initiatives of $3.2 million in 2023, non-interest expense increased $52.6 million, or 8.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in noninterest expense, excluding acquisition-related expenses and FultonFirst initiatives, was primarily due to increases of $19.9 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $13.0 million in FDIC insurance expense, primarily due to the adoption of a final rule to increase base deposit insurance assessment rates effective January 1, 2023, and the special assessment of $6.5 million charged to recover the loss to the DIF in connection with the closures of certain banks in 2023, $8.0 million in other outside services expense largely due to a number of corporate initiatives, $6.2 million in data processing and software expense due to ongoing investment in technology and customer growth and $2.1 million in marketing expense primarily due to a targeted customer deposit acquisition program and brand marketing campaigns. The $19.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was largely due to annual merit increases, an increase in the number of employees, higher healthcare claims expense and higher pension expense.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense for 2023 was $64.4 million, a $4.4 million increase compared to 2022. The ETR was 18.5% in 2023 compared to 17.3% in 2022. The increase in income tax expense in 2023 resulted primarily from the higher ETR. The ETR is generally lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax-exempt interest income earned on loans, investments in tax-free municipal securities and TCIs that generate tax credits under various federal programs.

During 2024, net loans increased $2.7 billion, or 12.6%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in net loans during 2024 was primarily due to $2.4 billion of net loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The overall increase in net loans was largely due to increases in commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans, of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
The Corporation does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any single borrower. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $11.0 billion, or 45.7%, of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial mortgage loans and construction loans. 
The Corporation has established lower total lending limits for certain types of commercial lending commitments and lower total lending limits based on the Corporation's internal risk rating of an individual borrower at the time the lending commitment is approved. The Corporation adheres to loan portfolio management practices, which include requiring an annual review of the

majority of loans. Additionally, management monitors the loan portfolio throughout the year taking into account, among other things, the size, complexity and level risk of loans and individual borrowers. An independent loan review function assesses the portfolio for internal risk rating accuracy and loan servicing policy requirements. The Corporation consolidates risk migrations to identify emerging risks by industry and real estate property types, taking into consideration economic forecasts and industry trends. In 2024, the Corporation identified the office and multi-family commercial mortgage loan portfolios as posing heightened risks and consequently moderated the volume of new loan originations. The Corporation takes a risk-based approach when reviewing a specific loan portfolio, such as the office loan or multi-family loan portfolios. The Corporation reviews portfolio concentrations and adjusts the lending limits based on asset quality, economic forecasts and industry outlook.

During 2024, non-accrual loans increased $67.7 million, or 55.6%, largely due to additions to non-accrual loans, partially offset by payments and charge-offs. During 2024, non-accrual loans as a percentage of net loans increased to 0.79%, compared to 0.57% as of December 31, 2023.

 The amount of interest income on non-accrual loans that was recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $1.0 million, $1.5 million and $2.2
     million, respectively.
(2)
 Accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due. In certain cases a loan may be placed on non-accrual status prior to being  
    90 days delinquent if there is an indication that the borrower is having difficulty making payments or the Corporation believes it is probable that all amounts  
    will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the agreement. When interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest previously credited to  
    income is reversed. Non-accrual loans may be restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest has been paid currently for six consecutive
    months or the loan is considered to be adequately secured and in the process of collection. Certain loans, primarily adequately collateralized residential  
    mortgage loans, may continue to accrue interest after reaching 90 days past due.

The Corporation's ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner is important to maintaining an adequate ACL. For commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used to monitor credit quality. The evaluation of credit risk for residential mortgages, home equity loans, construction loans to individuals, consumer loans and leases and other loans is based on payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends.
57
Total internally risk-rated loans were $15.4 billion and $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $1.8 billion and $925.0 million were criticized and classified loans, respectively. The following table presents criticized and classified loans, or those with internal risk ratings of special mention or substandard or lower for commercial mortgages, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans to commercial borrowers, by class segment:

The increase of $454.6 million in special mention loans as of December 31, 2024 was primarily due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction with a balance of $350.4 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase of $456.8 million in substandard or lower loans as of December, 31, 2024 was partially due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction with a balance of $193.0 million as of December 31, 2024.

Includes accruing loans past due 90 days or more.
The provision for credit losses for 2024 was $71.6 million compared to a provision for credit losses of $54.0 million in 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by a $23.4 million CECL Day 1 Provision related to the Republic First Transaction in 2024. Additionally, included in the ACL as of December 31, 2024 was $54.6 million recorded for PCD Loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction.
The ACL includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative models. See "Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

Management believes that the $379.2 million ACL - loans as of December 31, 2024 is sufficient to cover expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. 
Premises and Equipment
The $58.6 million decrease in land and buildings and improvements was primarily due to $73.5 million of asset disposals in the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, partially offset by $21.7 million of land and buildings and improvements purchased as part of the Republic First Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2024. The $73.5 million of premises and equipment disposals in the Sale-Leaseback Transaction included $42.5 million of related accumulated depreciation for a net disposal amount of $31.0 million.

During 2024, total deposits increased by $4.6 billion, or 21.3%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total deposits was primarily due to $3.7 billion of total deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. Overall, the increase in total deposits was largely due to increases in interest-bearing demand deposits, time deposits and savings and money market deposits of $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. 
Total uninsured deposits (excluding intra-Company deposits) were estimated to be $9.4 billion and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

During 2024, total borrowings decreased $705.5 million, or 28.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total borrowings was primarily due to decreases in FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and senior debt and subordinated debt  of $250.0 million, $240.0 million and $168.1 million, respectively.
In November 2024, the Corporation retired $168.8 million of subordinated notes issued in November 2014 and June 2015 which matured on November 15, 2024.
See "Note 10 - Borrowings" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
Other Liabilities
During 2024, other liabilities increased $176.4 million, or 22.4%, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in the operating lease liability due to the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, accrued expenses and as a result of affordable housing investments made in 2024.
Shareholders' Equity
During 2024, total shareholders' equity increased $437.2 million, or 15.8%, to $3.2 billion, or 10.0% of total assets, as of December 31, 2024. The increase in total shareholders' equity was largely due to net proceeds of $272.6 million related to the Corporation's underwritten public offering of 19,166,667 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, and $156.3 million in retained earnings. See "Note 15 - Shareholders' Equity" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for details of accumulated comprehensive loss.
Regulatory Capital
The Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Fulton Bank, are subject to the Capital Rules administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Corporation's financial statements.
The Capital Rules require the Corporation and Fulton Bank to:
•
Meet a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets;
•
Meet a minimum Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 4.00% of average assets;
•
Meet a minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% of risk-weighted assets;
•
Maintain a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments; and
•
Comply with a revised definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses. Certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, are excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation's size.
61
As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation's capital levels met the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffers, as prescribed in the Capital Rules.
As of December 31, 2024, Fulton Bank met the well-capitalized requirements under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, a bank must maintain minimum Total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, Common Equity Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the Capital Rules. There were no other conditions or events in 2024 that management believes have changed the Corporation's capital categories.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments. These obligations include payments for liabilities recorded on the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets as well as contractual obligations for purchased services.
Contractual purchase obligations to third parties that were fixed and determinable of approximately $72.4 million and $124.6 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include information technology, telecommunication and data processing outsourcing contracts. The decrease is primarily due to contract changes to annual renewals.

The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with OBS risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. Commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs, as they may expire without being drawn.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments. The types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk, equity market price risk, debt security market price risk, foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk. Due to the nature of its operations, foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk are not significant to the Corporation.
Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity
Interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas. First, changes in rates have an impact on the Corporation's liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow. Second, movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the Corporation's net interest income and changes in its economic value of its equity.
The Corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation's ALCO is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions of the Corporation, approving asset and liability management policies, and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions. 
The Corporation uses two complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk. They are a simulation of net interest income and estimates of economic value of equity. Using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of the Corporation's interest rate risk, level of risk as time evolves, and exposure to changes in interest rates.
Simulation of net interest income is performed for the next 12-month period. A variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve. These results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario. Simulation of net interest income is used primarily to measure the Corporation's short-term earnings exposure to rate movements. The Corporation's policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income, in a non-parallel instantaneous shock, to 10% of the base case net interest income for a 100 bps shock in interest rates, 15% for a 200 bps shock, 20% for a 300 bps shock and 25% for a 400 bps shock
. 
A "shock" is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates. The shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and/or volumes in the balance sheet, nor does it take into account the potential effects of competition on the pricing of deposits and loans over the forward 12-month period.
Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the simulation model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for non-maturity deposit accounts. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model's simulated results due to timing, amount and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.
The following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate changes in rate-ramp scenarios over a 12-month period, that is, a gradual non-parallel shift, on net interest income as of December 31, 2024:

Economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows. Discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities. Abrupt changes or "shocks" in interest rates, both upward and downward, are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment. This measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer-term repricing risks and options in the Corporation's balance sheet. The Corporation's policy limits the economic value of equity that may be at risk, in a non-parallel instantaneous shock, to 10% of the base case economic value of equity for a 100 bps shock in interest rates, 20% for a 200 bps shock, 30% for a 300 bps shock and 40% for a 400 bps shock. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every 100 bps shock.
Interest Rate Derivatives
The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Corporation simultaneously enters into interest rate derivatives with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and terms. The net result of these interest rate derivatives is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Corporation receives a floating rate. These interest rate derivatives are derivative financial instruments, and the gross fair values are recorded in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Corporation's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to reduce volatility in net interest income and net interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Corporation primarily uses interest rate derivatives as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing floating rate loans and borrowings. 
For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified into interest income or interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income or interest expense as interest payments are made on the Corporation's loans or borrowings.
On October 10, 2024, the Corporation terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a combined notional amount of $250 million. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized losses will be recorded in AOCI and will be recognized as an increase to interest expense when the previously forecasted hedged items affects earnings in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $0.2 million of these unrealized losses have been reclassified as an increase to interest expense on borrowings, on the consolidated statements of income.
In January 2023, the Corporation terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized losses that have been recorded in AOCI will be recognized as reduction to interest income, including fees, when the previously forecasted hedged item affects earnings in future periods. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $27.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively, of these unrealized losses have been reclassified as a reduction of interest income on loans, including fees, on the consolidated statements of income.
65
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Corporation executed $900.0 million of receive fixed, pay floating interest rate derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk to manage the Corporation's exposure to interest rate movements.
Liquidity
The Corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers, who, as depositors, may want to withdraw funds or who, as borrowers, need credit availability. Liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments and outstanding loans and through the availability of deposits and borrowings. The Corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short- and long-term needs.
The Corporation maintains liquidity sources in the form of interest-bearing deposits and customer funding (short-term promissory notes). The Corporation can access additional liquidity from these sources, if necessary, by increasing the rates of interest paid on those instruments. The positive impact to liquidity resulting from paying higher interest rates could have a detrimental impact on NIM and net interest income if rates on interest-earning assets do not experience a proportionate increase. Borrowing availability with the FHLB and the FRB, along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks, provides the Corporation with additional liquidity.
Fulton Bank is a member of the FHLB and has access to FHLB overnight and term credit facilities. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had total borrowing capacity of approximately $11.1 billion with $5.1 billion of advances and letters of credit outstanding, for a remaining available borrowing capacity of approximately $6.0 billion. Advances from the FHLB, when utilized, are secured by qualifying commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans, investments and other assets.
As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation had aggregate federal funds lines borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion with no amounts outstanding against that amount. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation had $3.1 billion of collateralized borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window with no amounts outstanding and had no borrowings drawn against the Bank Term Funding Program facility, which expired March 11, 2024. 
A combination of commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, consumer loans and securities are pledged to the FRB of Philadelphia to provide access to FRB discount window borrowings. Securities carried at $0.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2023 were pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits.
The Corporation has commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of commitments to extend credit was $8.8 billion and total letters of credit were $0.3 billion.
Liquidity must also be managed at the Parent Company level. For safety and soundness reasons, banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends. Generally, these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks’ regulatory capital levels and their net income. Management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the Parent Company including monitoring the granularity of the deposit portfolio and level of uninsured deposits. Management will implement appropriate strategies, as necessary, to remain adequately capitalized and to meet its cash needs. 
The consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information. The Corporation's operating activities during 2024 generated $416.6 million of cash, mainly due to net income of $288.7 million. Cash provided in investing activities was $1.6 billion, primarily due to $1.0 billion of net cash received for acquisitions in the Republic First Transaction. Net cash used by financing activities was $1.5 billion, due largely to $2.1 billion in repayment of borrowings.

The Corporation's investment portfolio consists mainly of state and municipal securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers' ability to prepay obligations. Cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates. As rates increase, cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease. As rates decrease, cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase.

Debt Security Market Price Risk
Debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt securities, unrelated to interest rate changes, could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Corporation. The Corporation's debt security investments consist primarily of U.S. government-sponsored agency issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt securities. All of the Corporation's investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have principal payments that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies.
State and Municipal Securities
As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation owned securities issued by various states and municipalities with a total fair value of $0.8 billion. Uncertainty with respect to the financial strength of state and municipal bond insurers places emphasis on the underlying strength of issuers. Pressure on local tax revenues of issuers due to adverse economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the underlying credit quality of issuers. The Corporation evaluates existing and potential holdings primarily based on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing state or municipality and then, to a lesser extent, on any credit enhancement. State and municipal securities can be supported by the general obligation of the issuing state or municipality, allowing the securities to be repaid by any means available to the issuing state or municipality. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 100% of state and municipal securities were supported by the general obligation of corresponding states or municipalities. Approximately 74% of these securities were school district issuances, which are also supported by the states of the issuing municipalities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business:
 The Corporation is a financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and financial services to businesses and consumers through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Fulton Bank. In addition, the Parent Company owns the following non-bank subsidiaries: Fulton Financial Realty Company, Central Pennsylvania Financial Corp., FFC Penn Square, Inc., Fulton Insurance Services Group, Inc. and Fulton Community Partner, LLC. Collectively, the Parent Company and its subsidiaries are referred to as the Corporation.
The Corporation's primary sources of revenue are interest income on loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and fee income earned on its products and services. Its expenses consist of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, provision for credit losses, other operating expenses and income taxes. The Corporation's primary competition is other financial services providers operating in its region. Competitors also include financial services providers located outside the Corporation's geographic market as a result of the growth in electronic delivery channels. The Corporation is subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by such regulatory agencies.
The Corporation offers, through its banking subsidiary, a full range of retail and commercial banking services in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. 
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation:
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of the Parent Company and all wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosed amount of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: 
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, which includes restricted cash. Restricted cash comprises cash balances required to be maintained with the FRB, based on customer transaction deposit account levels, and cash balances provided as collateral on derivative contracts and other contracts. See "Note 3 - Restrictions on Cash and Cash Equivalents" for additional information.

FRB and FHLB

Stock: 
The Bank is a member of the FRB and FHLB and is required by federal law to hold stock in these institutions according to predetermined formulas. These restricted investments are carried at cost on the consolidated balance sheets and are periodically evaluated for impairment.

Investments:
 Debt securities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase when the Corporation has both the intent and ability to hold these investments until they mature. Such debt securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective yield method. The Corporation does not engage in trading activities; however, since the investment portfolio serves as a source of liquidity, most debt securities are classified as AFS. AFS securities are carried at estimated fair value with the related unrealized holding gains and losses reported in shareholders' equity as a component of AOCI, net of tax. Realized securities gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded on a trade date basis.
HTM Debt Securities:

Expected credit losses on HTM debt securities would be recorded in the ACL on HTM debt securities. As of December 31, 2024, no HTM debt securities required an ACL as these investments consist solely of agency-guaranteed residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities.
AFS Debt Securities
: The Bank's AFS rated debt securities are investment grade. In evaluating credit losses on debt securities, management considers factors such as the credit quality of the investments, the credit rating of the security, and the delinquency history of the security. As of December 31, 2024, no AFS debt securities required an ACL.
Fair Value Option:
 The Corporation has elected to measure mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. Derivative financial instruments related to mortgage banking activities are also recorded at fair value, as detailed under the heading "Derivative Financial Instruments," below. The Corporation determines fair value for its mortgage loans held for sale based on the price that secondary market investors would pay for loans with similar characteristics, including interest rate and term, as of the date fair value is measured. Changes in fair values during the period are recorded as components of mortgage banking income on the 
76
consolidated statements of income. Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for sale is classified in interest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Loans
: Loans are stated at amortized cost, except for mortgage loans held for sale, which are carried at fair value. Interest income on loans is accrued as earned. 
In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become 
90
 days delinquent as to principal or interest. In certain cases a loan may be placed on non-accrual status prior to being 
90
 days delinquent if there is an indication that the borrower is having difficulty making payments, or the Corporation believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Non-accrual loans may be restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest has been paid currently for six consecutive months or the loan is considered adequately secured and in the process of collection. The Corporation generally applies payments received on non-accruing loans to principal until such time as the principal is paid off, after which time any payments received are recognized as interest income. If the Corporation believes that all amounts outstanding on a non-accrual loan will ultimately be collected, payments received subsequent to its classification as a non-accrual loan are allocated between interest income and principal.
A loan that is 90 days delinquent may continue to accrue interest if the loan is both adequately secured and is in the process of collection. Past due status is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments. An adequately secured loan is one that has collateral with a supported fair value that is sufficient to discharge the debt, and/or has an enforceable guarantee from a financially responsible party. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if collection is proceeding through legal action or through other activities that are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or restoration to current status in the near future.
Loans deemed to be a loss are written off through a charge against the ACL. Closed-end consumer loans are generally charged- off when they become 
120
 days past due (
180
 days for open-end consumer loans) if they are not adequately secured by real estate. All other loans are evaluated for possible charge-off when it is probable that the balance will not be collected, based on the ability of the borrower to pay and the value of the underlying collateral, if any. Principal recoveries of loans previously charged-off are recorded as increases to the ACL.
Loan Origination Fees and Costs:
 Loan origination fees and the related direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to interest income using the effective yield method. For mortgage loans sold, net loan origination fees and costs are included in the gain or loss on sale of the related loan, as components of mortgage banking.
Loan Modifications:
 Loans are accounted for and reported as modified when, for economic or legal reasons, the Corporation grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions, whether negotiated or imposed by bankruptcy, granted under a loan modification typically involve a more than insignificant deferral of scheduled loan payments, an extension of a loan's stated maturity date, a reduction in the interest rate or a forgiveness of principal. 
Because the effect of most modifications made to loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the ACL, a change to the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the forgiven portion of the loan is written off against the ACL. 
Allowance for Credit Losses:

The Corporation follows 
ASU 2016-13

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and HTM debt securities. It also applies to OBS credit exposures, such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments, and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with ASC Topic 842.
The Corporation has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the measurement of its ACL. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any outstanding accrued interest is reversed against interest income.
The ACL consists of loans evaluated collectively and individually for expected credit losses. The ACL represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to net loans. The ACL is increased or decreased (when the provision for credit losses is negative) through the provision for credit losses and increased or decreased (when recoveries of loans previously charged off exceed loans charged off) by charge-offs, net of 
77
recoveries. The reserve for OBS credit exposures includes estimated losses on unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and other OBS credit exposures.
Loans: 
The ACL is an estimate of the expected losses to be realized over the life of the loans in the portfolio. The ACL is determined for two distinct categories of loans: (i) loans evaluated collectively for expected credit losses and (ii) loans evaluated individually for expected credit losses. 
Loans Evaluated Collectively
: Loans evaluated collectively for expected credit losses include accruing loans and non-accrual loans where the total commitment amount is less than $1 million. In determining the ACL, the Corporation uses three inputs to model the estimate. These inputs are the PD rate which estimates the likelihood that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations, the LGD rate which estimates the percentage of an asset that is lost if a borrower defaults, and the EAD balance which estimates the gross exposure under a facility upon default. The PD models were developed based on historical default data. Both internal and external variables are evaluated in the process. The main internal variables are risk rating or delinquency history and indicators of default. The external variables are economic variables obtained from third-party forecasts. 
The PD models are transition matrix models that utilize historical credit observations and incorporate economic forecasts to project future default rates using a linear regression methodology for each loan segment. The LGD model uses a vintage loss approach that estimates LGD rates based on the bank’s historical loss experience for each loan segment. The EAD incorporates a prepayment rate and applies the PD rates to estimate the projected exposure at default across the life of each loan. The ACL is calculated by applying the LGD to the EAD at each period across the life of each loan. 
The ACL incorporates the Corporation’s historical credit observations, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that are statistically correlated with historical PD rates. The reasonable and supportable forecast extends to 24 months and reverts back to an average PD rate using a straight-line reversion methodology over a 12 month period. 

The ACL is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the reserve. As such, the calculation of the ACL is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise judgment. 
The ACL may include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative models. In determining qualitative adjustments, management considers changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and their impact on the lending environment, including underwriting standards and other factors affecting credit losses over the remaining life of each loan.
Loans Evaluated Individually
: Loans evaluated individually for expected credit losses include loans on non-accrual status  where the commitment amount equals or exceeds $1.0 million. The required ACL for such loans is determined using the present value of expected future cash flows, observable market price or the fair value of collateral. 
Loans evaluated individually may have specific allocations of the ACL assigned if the measured value of the loan using one of the noted techniques is less than its current carrying value. For loans measured using the fair value of collateral, if the analysis determines that sufficient collateral value would be available for repayment of the debt, then no allocations would be assigned to those loans. Collateral could be in the form of real estate or business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, in the case of commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real estate.
For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through appraisals performed by third-party appraisers, discounted to arrive at expected net sale proceeds. For collateral-dependent loans, estimated real estate fair values are also net of estimated selling costs. When a real estate secured loan is impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including: the age of the most recent appraisal; the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal; the condition of the property; the Corporation's experience and knowledge of the real estate market; the purpose of the loan; market factors; payment status; the strength of any guarantors; and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions, among others. The Corporation generally obtains updated appraisals performed by third-party appraisers for impaired loans secured predominantly by real estate every 
12
 months.
When updated appraisals are not obtained for loans secured by real estate, fair values are estimated based on the original appraisal values, as long as the original appraisal indicated an acceptable loan-to-value position and there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value since the original appraisal was performed.
78
For loans with principal balances greater than or equal to $1.0 million secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable or inventory, estimated fair values are determined based on borrower financial statements, inventory listings, accounts receivable agings or borrowing base certificates provided by the borrower. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. Liquidation or collection discounts are applied to these assets based upon existing loan evaluation policies.
Management regularly reviews loans in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loan classification. For commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk rating categories is a significant component of the ACL methodology for these loans, which bases the PD on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. Risk ratings may be changed based on ongoing monitoring procedures, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan.
The following is a summary of the Corporation's internal risk rating categories:
•
Pass
: These loans do not currently pose undue credit risk and can range from the highest to average quality, depending on the degree of potential risk.
•
Special Mention
: These loans have a heightened credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a classification of Substandard. Loans in this category are currently acceptable but, are nevertheless potentially weak.
•
Substandard or Lower
: These loans are inadequately protected by current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower. There exists a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the normal repayment of the debt.
The Corporation considers risk factors such as: local and national economic conditions; trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans; the diversity of borrower industry types; and the composition of the portfolio by loan type.
OBS Credit Exposures:

The reserve for OBS credit exposures is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, and represents management's estimate of expected losses in its unfunded loan commitments and other OBS credit exposures. The reserve for OBS credit exposures specific to unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws. Future draws are based on historical averages of utilization rates (i.e., the likelihood of draws taken). The reserve for OBS credit exposures is increased or decreased by charges or reductions to expense, through the provision for credit losses.
Premises and Equipment:
 Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are a maximum of 
50
 years for buildings and improvements, 
8
 years for furniture and 
7
 years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the non-cancelable lease term.
Premises and equipment acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at cost less depreciation and amortization.
 See "Note 6 - Premises and Equipment" for additional information. 
OREO:
 Assets acquired in settlement of mortgage loan indebtedness are recorded as OREO and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, initially at the lower of the estimated fair value of the asset, less estimated selling costs, or the carrying amount of the loan. Costs to maintain the assets and subsequent gains and losses on sales are included in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.
MSRs:
 The estimated fair value of MSRs related to residential mortgage loans sold and serviced by the Corporation is recorded as an asset upon the sale of such loans. MSRs are amortized as a reduction to mortgage servicing income, included as a component of mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income, over the estimated lives of the underlying loans.
MSRs are stratified and evaluated for impairment by comparing each stratum's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Fair values are determined through a discounted cash flows valuation completed by a third-party valuation expert. Significant inputs to the valuation include expected net servicing income, the discount rate and the expected lives of the underlying loans. Expected life is based on the contractual terms of the loans, as adjusted for prepayment projections. To the extent the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeds their estimated fair value, a valuation allowance is established through a charge against servicing income. If subsequent valuations indicate that impairment no longer exists, the valuation allowance is reduced through an increase to servicing income.
 See "Note 8 - Mortgage Servicing Rights" for additional information.
79
Derivative Financial Instruments: 
The Corporation manages its exposure to certain interest rate risk through the use of derivatives. Certain of the Corporation's outstanding derivative contracts are designated as hedges, and none are entered into for speculative purposes. The Corporation enters into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even if hedge accounting does not apply or the Corporation elects not to apply hedge accounting.
The Corporation records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Corporation has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. The Corporation does not have any derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges where hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value are recognized in OCI, net of tax. For derivatives where hedge accounting does not apply, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as components of non-interest income or non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.
Derivative contracts create counterparty credit risk with both the Corporation's customers and with institutional derivative counterparties. The Corporation manages counterparty credit risk through its credit approval processes, monitoring procedures and obtaining adequate collateral, when the Corporation determines it is appropriate to do so and in accordance with counterparty contracts.
For each of the derivatives, gross derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Related gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in other changes, net on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Mortgage Banking Derivatives
In connection with its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation enters into commitments to originate certain fixed-rate residential mortgage loans for customers, also referred to as interest rate locks. In addition, the Corporation enters into forward commitments for the future sales or purchases of mortgage-backed securities to or from third-party counterparties to hedge the effect of changes in interest rates on the values of both the interest rate locks and mortgage loans held for sale. Forward sales commitments may also be in the form of commitments to sell individual mortgage loans at a fixed price at a future date. The amount necessary to settle each interest rate lock is based on the price that secondary market investors would pay for loans with similar characteristics, including interest rate and term, as of the date fair value is measured. 
Interest Rate Derivatives - Non-Designated Hedges
The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Corporation simultaneously enters into interest rate derivatives with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and terms. The net result of these interest rate derivatives is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Corporation receives a floating rate. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. 
The Corporation's existing OBS credit exposures result from participation in interest rate derivatives provided by external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Corporation's assets or liabilities. 
The Corporation is required to clear all eligible interest rate derivative contracts with a clearing agent and is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Corporation's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to reduce volatility in net interest income and interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Corporation primarily uses interest rate derivatives as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing floating rate loans and borrowings. 
80
For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in OCI, net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into interest income or interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in OCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income or interest expense as interest payments are made on the Corporation's variable-rate loans and borrowings.
Foreign Exchange Contracts
The Corporation enters into foreign exchange contracts to accommodate the needs of its customers. Foreign exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a specific date at a contractual price. The Corporation limits its foreign exchange exposure with customers by entering into contracts with institutional counterparties to mitigate its foreign exchange risk. The Corporation also holds certain amounts of Foreign Currency Nostro Accounts. The Corporation limits the total overnight net foreign currency open positions, which is defined as an aggregate of all outstanding contracts, to $
0.5
 million.
 See "Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional information.
Balance Sheet Offsetting:
 Certain financial assets and liabilities may be eligible for offset on the consolidated balance sheets because they are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The Corporation has elected to net its financial assets and liabilities designated as cash flow hedges when offsetting is permitted. The Corporation has elected not to offset the remaining assets and liabilities subject to such arrangements on the consolidated financial statements.
The Corporation is a party to interest rate derivatives with financial institution counterparties and customers. Under these agreements, the Corporation has the right to net-settle multiple contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. Cash collateral is posted by the party with a net liability position in accordance with contract thresholds and can be used to settle the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in the event of default. A daily settlement occurs through a clearing agent for changes in the fair value of centrally cleared derivatives. Not all derivatives are required to be cleared through a daily clearing agent. As a result, the total fair values of interest rate derivative assets and derivative liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets are not equal and offsetting.
The Corporation is also a party to foreign exchange contracts with financial institution counterparties under which the Corporation has the right to net-settle multiple contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. As with interest rate derivatives, cash collateral is posted by the party with a net liability position in accordance with contract thresholds and can be used to settle the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts in the event of default.

For additional information on balance sheet offsetting, see "Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments."
Income Taxes: 
The Corporation utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, DTAs and deferred tax liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities as reflected in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As changes in tax law or rates are enacted, DTAs and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense. In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the amount of taxes paid in available carryback years, projected future taxable income, and, if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A valuation allowance is provided against DTAs unless it is more likely than not that such DTAs will be realized.
ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes" creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions, and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.
See "Note 13 - Income Taxes" for additional information. 
Stock-Based Compensation:
 The Corporation grants equity awards to employees, consisting of restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs under its Employee Equity Plan. In addition, employees may purchase stock under the Corporation's ESPP.
The Corporation also grants equity awards to non-employee members of its Board of Directors and Fulton Bank's Board of Directors under the Directors' Plan. Under the Directors' Plan, the Corporation can grant equity awards to non-employee 
81
holding company and subsidiary bank directors in the form of restricted stock, RSUs or common stock. Recent grants of equity awards under the Directors' Plan have been limited to RSUs.
Equity awards issued under the Employee Equity Plan are generally granted annually and become fully vested over or after a 
three-year
 vesting period. The vesting period for non-performance-based awards represents the period during which employees are required to provide service in exchange for such awards. Equity awards under the Directors' Plan are generally granted annually and fully vest after a 
one-year
 vesting period. Certain events, as defined in the Employee Equity Plan and the Directors' Plan, result in the acceleration of the vesting of equity awards. Restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs earn dividends during the vesting period, which are forfeitable if the awards do not vest.
The fair value of stock options, restricted stock and RSUs granted to employees or directors is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period for such awards. Compensation expense for PSUs is also recognized over the vesting period and service period, however, compensation expense for PSUs may vary based on the expectations for actual performance relative to defined performance measures.
The fair value of restricted stock, RSUs and a majority of PSUs are based on the trading price of the Corporation's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of certain PSUs are estimated through the use of the Monte Carlo valuation methodology as of the date of grant.
 See "Note 16 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans" for additional information. The Corporation has not issued stock options since 2014 and accordingly, there is no compensation expense for this instrument. All stock options have been exercised or expired during 2024.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: 
Fulton Financial Corporation is a single segment. The Corporation's Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews consolidated results on a GAAP basis.

Financial Guarantees
: Financial guarantees, which consist primarily of standby and commercial letters of credit, are accounted for by recognizing a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantees and crediting the liability to income over the term of the guarantee. Fair value is estimated based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar terms.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets: 
The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires that all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized, be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any purchase price lower than the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as a gain on acquisition, net of tax. 
Goodwill is not amortized to expense, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the balance, if necessary as a result of the impairment test, are charged to expense in the period in which goodwill is determined to be impaired. The Corporation performs its annual assessment of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. If certain events occur which indicate goodwill might be impaired between annual assessments, goodwill would be evaluated when such events occur. 
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives. Some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are, therefore, not amortized. All intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur. Any impairment write-downs are recognized as non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.
 See "Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets," for additional information.
VIEs:
 ASC Topic 810 provides guidance on when to consolidate certain VIEs in the financial statements of the Corporation. VIEs are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance activities without additional financial support from other parties. VIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC Topic 810 when the Corporation holds variable interests in these entities. The Corporation consolidates VIEs when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The Corporation makes investments in certain community development projects, the majority of which generate tax credits under various federal programs, including TCIs. These investments are made throughout the Corporation's market area as a means of supporting the communities it serves. The Corporation typically acts as a limited partner or member of a limited liability company in its TCIs and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnership or limited liability company. Tax credits earned are subject to recapture by federal taxing authorities based upon compliance requirements to be met at the project level.
82
Because the Corporation owns 100% of the equity interests in its NMTC investments, these investments were consolidated based on ASC Topic 810 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investments in affordable housing projects were not consolidated based on management's assessment of the provisions of ASC Topic 810.
TCIs are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the current carrying value exceeds its aggregated remaining value of the tax benefits of the investment. There were no impairment losses recognized for the Corporation's TCIs in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
 For additional information, see "Note 13 - Income Taxes."
Fair Value Measurements:
 Assets and liabilities are categorized in a fair value hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value using the following three categories (from highest to lowest priority):
•
Level 1 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•
Level 2 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or quoted prices for identical instruments in non-active markets. Also included are valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices, such as interest rates or other market-corroborated means.
•
Level 3 - Inputs that are largely unobservable, as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued.
The Corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels.
 See "Note 19 - Fair Value Measurements" for additional information.
Revenue Recognition:
 The sources of revenue for the Corporation are interest income from loans, leases and investments and non-interest income. Non-interest income is earned from various banking and financial services that the Corporation offers through its subsidiaries. Revenue is recognized as earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided. Following is further detail of the various types of revenue the Corporation earns and when it is recognized:
Interest income
: Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis according to loan and lease agreements, investment securities contracts or other written contracts.
Wealth management services: 
Consists of income from trust commissions, brokerage, money market and insurance commissions. Trust commissions consist of advisory fees that are based on market values of clients' managed portfolios and transaction fees for fiduciary services performed, both of which are recognized when earned. Brokerage income includes advisory fees which are recognized when earned on a monthly basis and transaction fees that are recognized when transactions occur. Money market income is based on the balances held in trust accounts and is recognized monthly. Insurance commissions are earned and recognized when policies are originated. Currently, no investment management and trust service income is based on performance or investment results.
Commercial and consumer banking income:
 Consists of cash management, overdraft and other service charges on deposit accounts as well as branch fees, ATM fees, debit and credit card income and merchant services fees. Also included are letter of credit fees, foreign exchange income and interest rate derivative fees. Revenue is primarily transactional and recognized when earned at the time the transactions occur.
Mortgage banking income: 
Consists of gains or losses on the sale of residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing income. 
Other Income: 
Includes gains on sales of SBA loans, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other miscellaneous income.

Leases: 
All leases with an initial term greater than 12 months recognize: (1) a ROU asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term; and (2) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, each measured on a discounted basis. The Corporation elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. 
As a lessee, the majority of the operating lease portfolio consists of real estate leases for the Corporation's financial centers, land and office space. The operating leases have remaining lease terms of 
1
 year to 
20
 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 
5
 years or more. ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. 
83
Certain real estate leases have lease payments that adjust based on annual changes in the CPI or at a stated contractual rate. The leases that are dependent upon the CPI or stated contractual rate are initially measured using the CPI or contractual rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability.
Operating lease expense represents fixed lease payments for operating leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Variable lease expense represents expenses such as the payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance based on the Corporation's pro-rata share.
Sublease income consists mostly of operating leases for space within the Corporation's offices and financial centers and is recorded as a reduction to net occupancy expense on the consolidated statements of income.
 See "Note 18 - Leases" for additional information.
Defined Benefit Plan:
 Net periodic pension costs are funded based on the requirements of federal laws and regulations. The determination of net periodic pension costs is based on assumptions about future events that will affect the amount and timing of required benefit payments under the plan. These assumptions include demographic assumptions such as retirement age and mortality, a discount rate used to determine the current benefit obligation, form of payment election and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. Net periodic pension expense includes interest cost, based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credit and amortization of net actuarial gains or losses. The Corporation curtailed the Pension Plan in 2008, with no additional benefits accruing. In connection with the Merger, the Corporation assumed the obligations of Prudential Bancorp under a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan that had previously been closed to new Prudential Bancorp participants. Net periodic pension cost is recognized in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
 For additional information, see "Note 17 - Employee Benefit Plans."
Business Combinations:  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, unless the acquisition is a bargain purchase. Results of the operations of the acquired entity are included in the consolidated statement of income from the acquisition date. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

NOTE 2 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On the Acquisition Date, Fulton Bank acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. As part of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank acquired approximately $
4.8
 billion of assets of Republic First Bank and received approximately $
0.8
 billion of cash from the FDIC. The Bank assumed approximately $
5.6
 billion of total liabilities of Republic First Bank. The Bank did not enter into a loss sharing arrangement with the FDIC in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 
As a result of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank enhanced its presence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
The Republic First Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows and market conditions at the time of the Republic First Transaction.
The Bank is awaiting conclusion of the customary final settlement process to determine whether certain assets and liabilities of Republic First Bank will be acquired by the Bank. Until the settlement process is finalized, the preliminary gain on acquisition can be updated for a period not to exceed one year following the Acquisition Date. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, provide a reasonable basis for determining the preliminary gain on acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2024, adjustments to the estimated fair values of certain assets acquired were recorded, resulting in a decrease of $
2.7
 million in the preliminary gain on acquisition, net of income taxes. 
The excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired and the cash consideration received from the FDIC over the estimated fair value of liabilities assumed was recorded as a preliminary gain on acquisition of $
37.0
 million, net of income taxes. 
85

In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Bank assumed 
14
 leases from the FDIC in accordance with the terms of the P and A Agreement. Upon assignment of the leases, the Corporation recorded at fair market value, a $
13.1
 million ROU asset and a corresponding $
14.4
 million lease liability, with the $
1.3
 million difference recognized as a decrease to gain on acquisition, before income taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Bank purchased 
15
 premises and related property, plant and equipment in accordance with the P and A Agreement. Upon the purchase, the Corporation recorded at fair market value, $
21.7
 million in premises and equipment, with a corresponding reduction of $
1.0
 million in gain on acquisition, before income taxes. 
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.
Cash and due from banks:
 The fair values of cash and due from banks approximate their book values.
Investment securities:
 The investment portfolio acquired in the Republic First Transaction, with a fair value of $
1.9
 billion, was sold by the Corporation shortly after the Acquisition Date. The fair value of the investment portfolio was based on the proceeds from the sale.
Loans:
 The Corporation recorded $
2.5
 billion of acquired loans that were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value for the loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates and other market factors from the perspective of a market participant. Loan cash flows were generated on an individual loan basis. The PD, LGD, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses that are embedded in the estimated cash flows.

The Republic First Transaction resulted in the addition of $
78.1
 million to the ACL, including the $
54.6
 million identified in the table above for PCD Loans, and $
23.4
 million recorded through the provision for credit losses at the Acquisition Date for non-PCD Loans.
Intangible assets: 
The Corporation recorded $
92.6
 million of CDI reflected in other assets that is being amortized over 
seven years
 using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. The estimated fair value of the CDI was determined using the cost savings approach. The cost savings approach is defined as the difference between the cost of funds of core deposits and an alternative cost of funds for those deposits. The CDI estimated fair value was determined by projecting discounted net cash flows that included assumptions related to customer attrition rates, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit account maintenance costs and alternative cost of funding rates.
FHLB stock: 
The Corporation acquired $
37.9
 million of FHLB stock. The estimated fair value of the FHLB stock approximated its book value.
Accrued interest receivable: 
The Corporation acquired $
16.2
 million of accrued interest receivable. The fair value of the accrued interest receivable approximated its book value.
Core deposits: 
Demand deposits, savings and money market deposits and time deposits (less than $250,000) were recorded at book value which approximated fair value. The Corporation recorded $
92.6
 million of CDI in other assets for these deposits.

Time deposits: 
Time deposits of $250,000 and greater were valued based on a comparison with the contractual cost of a portfolio of brokered deposits having a similar tenor. As the time deposit portfolio had a remaining average life of approximately three months, the estimated fair value of the time deposits approximated their book value and no adjustment was recorded.
Borrowings: 
Borrowings assumed in the Republic First Transaction, with a fair value of $
1.4
 billion, were repaid shortly after the Acquisition Date. The fair value of borrowings was based on the repayment amounts.
87
Acquisition-related expenses:
The Corporation developed a comprehensive integration plan under which it incurred direct costs that are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the Republic First Transaction are included in acquisition-related expenses in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income.
The following table details the costs identified and classified as acquisition-related expenses:

In connection with the Republic First Transaction, Fulton Bank made a $
5.0
 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation
to provide additional impact grants to nonprofit community organizations across the region that share the Bank's vision of advancing economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Corporation closed 
13
 of the Bank's financial center offices and consolidated the operations of those offices into nearby financial center offices operated by the Bank. The plan was adopted as part of the Bank's integration of the assets acquired and the deposits and certain other liabilities assumed in the Republic First Transaction. The premises and equipment of the 
13
 locations included 
five
 locations owned by the Bank and 
eight
 locations leased by the Bank. The Corporation recorded pre-tax costs of approximately $
9.8
 million reflected in acquisition-related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024, consisting of write-offs of premises and equipment and related expenses, and lease termination charges.

Unaudited Pro Forma Information:
The amount of net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income of $
111.4
 million, $
44.7
 million, $
71.9
 million and $
50.5
 million, respectively, attributable to the Republic First Transaction were included in the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. Included in non-interest income above is $
37.0
 million

related to the gain on acquisition, net of tax. Net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income shown above reflect management's best estimates based on information available. 
Republic First Bank does not have historical financial information that the Corporation could base pro forma information. Additionally, the Bank did not acquire all of the assets or assume all of the liabilities of Republic First Bank. Therefore, it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the Republic First Transaction in accordance with ASC 805-10-50-2.

The Corporation's collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. The change in fair value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell, and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell, any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost. In addition, these securities have principal payments that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Therefore, the Corporation does not have an ACL for these investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no ACL was required for the Corporation's state and municipal securities. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost, which may be at maturity. Therefore, the Corporation did not record a loss on these investments as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The majority of the corporate debt securities were rated at or above investment grade as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Based on the payment status, rating and management's evaluation of these securities, no ACL was required for corporate debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will more likely than not to be required to sell any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to 
92
amortized cost, which may be at maturity. Therefore, the Corporation did not record a loss on these investments as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

These amounts are reflected in the provision for credit loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(2)

Provision included in the table only includes the portion related to net loans.
The ACL may include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative models. In determining qualitative adjustments, management considers changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and their impact on the lending environment, including underwriting standards and other factors affecting credit losses over the remaining life of each loan.  
The increase in ACL in 2024 was largely due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction. The increase in ACL in 2023 was primarily due to loan growth, changes to the macroeconomic outlook, net charge-offs and risk migration.

Collateral-Dependent Loans
A loan or a lease is considered to be collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. For all classes of loans and leases deemed collateral-dependent, the Corporation elected the practical expedient to estimate expected credit losses based on the collateral’s fair value less costs to sell. Substantially all of the collateral supporting collateral-dependent loans or leases consists of various types of real estate, including residential properties, commercial properties, such as retail centers, office buildings, and lodging, agricultural land, and vacant land. Commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real estate.
94
All loans individually evaluated for impairment are measured for losses on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Corporation's individually evaluated loans with total commitments greater than or equal to $
1.0
 million were measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan's collateral, if any. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
90
% and 
78
%, respectively, of loans evaluated individually for impairment with principal balances greater than or equal to $
1.0
 million, whose primary collateral consisted of real estate, were measured at estimated fair value using appraisals performed by state certified third-party appraisers that had been updated in the preceding 12 months.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $
105.2
 million and $
52.8
 million, respectively, of non-accrual loans that did not have a specific valuation allowance within the ACL. The estimated fair values of the collateral securing these loans exceeded their carrying amount, or the loans were previously charged down to realizable collateral values. Accordingly, no specific valuation allowance was considered to be necessary. The amount of interest income on non-accrual loans that was recognized was approximately $
1.0
 million in 2024 and $
1.5
 million in 2023.
Asset Quality
Maintaining an appropriate ACL is dependent on various factors, including the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner. For commercial construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, and commercial real estate loans, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk categories is a significant component of the ACL methodology for these loans, which bases the PD on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. The Corporation's loan review officers provide a separate assessment of risk rating accuracy. Risk ratings may be changed based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by loan officers or credit administration staff, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in a loan.

The Corporation considers the performance of the loan portfolio and its impact on the ACL. The Corporation does not assign internal risk ratings to smaller balance, homogeneous loans, such as home equity, residential mortgage, construction loans to individuals secured by residential real estate, consumer and other loans. For these loans, the most relevant credit quality indicator is delinquency status, and the Corporation evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The Corporation modifies loans by providing a concession when deemed appropriate. Depending on the circumstances, a term extension, interest rate reduction or principal forgiveness may be granted. In certain instances a combination of concessions may be provided to a borrower.
100
When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of principal forgiven is deemed to be uncollectible and the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the amount of the forgiven portion, with a corresponding reduction to the ACL.
The following table presents the amortized cost basis of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by class of financing receivable and type of concession granted:

MSRs represent the economic value of contractual rights to service mortgage loans that have been sold. The total portfolio of mortgage loans serviced by the Corporation for unrelated third parties was $
4.1
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Actual and expected prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans can impact the fair value of MSRs. The Corporation accounts for MSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
The fair value of MSRs is estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows from servicing income, net of expense, over the expected life of the underlying loans at a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with these assets. Expected life is based on the contractual terms of the loans, as adjusted for prepayment projections. The fair values of MSRs were $
54.0
 million, $
49.7
 million and $
50.0
 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on its fair value analysis as of December 31, 2024,  2023, and 2022, the Corporation determined that 
no
 valuation allowances were required.
Total servicing income, included in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income, was $
10.2
 million, $
10.2
 million and $10.6 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Total MSRs amortization expense, recognized as a reduction to mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income, was $

interest rate swap transactions from LIBOR to SOFR. During 2024, the increase to other non-interest income to reflect market valuation movements from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR was $0.4 million. During 2023, the reduction to other non-interest income related to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR was $1.9 million.

 For interest rate derivative assets, amounts represent any derivative liability fair values that could be offset in the event of counterparty or customer default. 
    For interest rate derivative liabilities, amounts represent any derivative asset fair values that could be offset in the event of counterparty or customer default.
(2)
 Amounts represent cash collateral received from the counterparty or posted by the Corporation on interest rate derivative transactions and foreign 
    exchange contracts with financial institution counterparties. Interest rate derivatives with customers are collateralized by the same collateral securing the 
    underlying loans to those borrowers. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the net derivative fair values.
Cash Flow Hedge Terminations
On October 10, 2024, the Corporation terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a combined notional amount of $250 million. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized losses will be recorded in AOCI and will be recognized as an increase to interest expense when the previously forecasted hedged items affect earnings in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $0.2 million of these unrealized losses were reclassified as an increase to interest expense on borrowings on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
In January 2023, the Corporation terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a combined notional amount of $
1.0
 billion. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized losses that have been recorded in AOCI are recognized as reduction to interest income, including fees, when the previously forecasted hedged item affects earnings in future periods. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $27.9 million and $
22.1
 million, respectively, of these unrealized losses have been reclassified as a reduction of interest income on loans, including fees, on the consolidated statements of income.

NOTE 12 - REGULATORY MATTERS
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Basel III Rules
The Basel III Rules provide a comprehensive framework and require the Corporation and the Bank to: 
•
Meet a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 capital of 6.00% of risk-weighted assets;
•
Meet a minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.00% of average assets;
•
Maintain a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments; and
•
Comply with a revised definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses. Certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, are excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation's size. 
The Corporation and the Bank are required to maintain a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The rules provide that the failure to maintain the "capital conservation buffer" results in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As a result, under the Basel III Rules, if the Bank fails to maintain the required minimum capital conservation buffer, the Corporation will be subject to limits, and possibly prohibitions, on its ability to obtain capital distributions from such subsidiaries. If the Corporation does not receive sufficient cash dividends from the Bank, it may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on its common stock, service its debt obligations or repurchase its common stock. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation's capital levels met the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffers, as prescribed in the Basel III Rules.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action based on its capital ratio calculation. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank was required to maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, Common Equity Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. 
There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2024, that management believes have changed the Corporation and the Bank's categories.

Dividend and Loan Limitations
The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Parent Company are subject to certain legal and regulatory limitations. The total amount available for payment of dividends by the Bank to the Parent Company calculated using the three-year earnings test was approximately $
334.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 based on the Bank maintaining enough capital to be considered well capitalized under the Basel III Rules. A condition of the OCC’s approval of the Republic First Transaction requires that the Bank, for a period of two years following the Acquisition Date, request and receive a written determination of no supervisory objection from the OCC prior to declaring or paying any dividend to the Parent Company
Under current regulations, the Bank is limited in the amount it may lend to its affiliates, including the Parent Company. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 
10
%, and the aggregate of loans to all affiliates may not exceed 
20
% of the Bank's regulatory capital.

In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and/or capital gain income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, such as those that may be implemented to generate capital gains, in making this assessment.
The valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss carryforwards for which realizability is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
389.3
 million and $
354.1
 million, respectively, which are available to offset future state taxable income, and expire at various dates through 2044.
As of December 31, 2024, based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the DTAs are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Corporation will realize the benefits of its DTAs, net of the valuation allowance.

Virtually all of the Corporation's unrecognized tax benefits are for positions that are taken on an annual basis on state tax returns. Increases to unrecognized tax benefits will occur as a result of accruing for the nonrecognition of the position for the current year.
Decreases will occur as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations for the oldest outstanding year which includes the position. These offsetting increases and decreases are likely to continue in the future, including over the next twelve months. While the net effect on total unrecognized tax benefits during this period cannot be reasonably estimated, approximately $
82
 thousand is expected to reverse in 2025 due to lapsing of the statute of limitations. Decreases can also occur throughout the settlement of positions with taxing authorities.
As of December 31, 2024, if recognized, all of the Corporation's unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate. Not included in the table above is $

 thousand of federal income tax benefit on unrecognized state tax benefits which, if recognized, would also impact the effective tax rate. Interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as a component of income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would also be recognized in income tax expense. The Corporation recognized approximately $
168
 thousand and $
138
 thousand of recoveries in 2024 and 2023, respectively, for interest and penalties in income tax expense related to unrecognized tax positions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions were approximately $
177
 thousand and $
0.3
 million, respectively.
The Corporation files income tax returns in the federal and various state jurisdictions. In most cases, unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. With few exceptions, the Corporation is no longer subject to federal, state and local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021.
Tax Credit Investments
The TCIs are included in other assets, with any unfunded equity commitments recorded in 
other liabilities
 on the consolidated balance sheets and changes are reflected in change in tax credit investments in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
In 2023, the Corporation adopted ASU 2023-02, which allows all TCIs to qualify for the proportional amortization method if: (1) it is probable that the income tax credits allocatable to the Corporation will be available; (2) the Corporation does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the underlying project; (3) substantially all of the projected benefits are from income tax credits and other income tax benefits; (4) the Corporation's projected yield based solely on the cash flows from the income tax credits and other income tax benefits is positive; and (5) the Corporation is a limited liability investor in the limited liability entity for both legal and tax purposes, and the Corporation’s liability is limited to its capital investment. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
All TCIs held as of December 31, 2024 that qualify for the proportional amortization method are amortized over the period the Corporation expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense included within 
income taxes
 on the Consolidated Statements of Income and 
net income
 in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
All TCIs are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period. There were no impairments recorded against TCIs during 2024.

NOTE 14 - NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net income per common share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted net income per common share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the incremental number of shares added as a result of converting common stock equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock method. The Corporation's common stock equivalents consist of outstanding

restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs. PSUs are required to be included in weighted average diluted shares outstanding if performance measures, as defined in each PSU award agreement, are met as of the end of the period.

%, 
22.1
% and 
17.8
% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These percentages differ from the Corporation's federal statutory tax rate of 
21
%. Tax benefits are only recognized over the vesting period for awards that ordinarily will generate a tax deduction when exercised, in the case of non-qualified stock options, or upon vesting, in the case of restricted stock, RSUs, and PSUs. Tax benefits in excess of the tax rate resulted from incentive stock option exercises that triggered a tax deduction when they were exercised and excess tax benefits realized on vesting RSUs and PSUs during the period.

As of December 31, 2024, there was

$
11.4
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost (pre-tax) related to restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs that will be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of 
1.89
 years. As of December 31, 2024, the Employee Equity Plan had 
3.8
 million shares reserved for future grants through 2032, and the Directors' Plan had 
325.1
 thousand shares reserved for future grants through 2033.
The fair value of certain PSUs with market-based performance conditions granted under the Employee Equity Plan was estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo valuation methodology performed by a third-party valuation expert. This valuation is dependent upon certain assumptions, as summarized in the following table:
2024

 years

 years
The expected life of the PSUs with fair values measured using the Monte Carlo valuation methodology was based on the defined performance period of 
three years
. Volatility of the Corporation's stock was based on historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the PSUs. The risk-free interest rate is the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury rate commensurate with the expected life of the PSUs on the date of the grant. Based on the assumptions above, the Corporation calculated an estimated fair value per PSU with market-based performance conditions granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $
19.59
, $
10.63
 and $
14.93
, respectively.
Under the ESPP, eligible employees can purchase stock of the Corporation at 
85
% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase. The ESPP is considered to be a compensatory plan and, as such, compensation expense is recognized for the 
15
% discount on shares purchased.

The 401(k) Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan under which eligible employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax covered compensation on an annual basis, with employer matches of up to 
5
% of employee compensation. Employee and employer contributions under these features are 
100
% vested.
Contributions to the Pension Plan are actuarially determined and funded annually, if necessary. The Corporation recognizes the funded status of its Pension Plan on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes the changes in that funded status through OCI. The Pension Plan has been curtailed, with no additional benefits accruing to participants.

Investment allocation decisions are made by a retirement plan committee. The goal of the investment allocation strategy is to match certain benefit obligations with maturities of fixed income securities. Alternative investments may include managed futures, commodities, real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships, and long-short strategies with traditional stocks and bonds. All alternative investments are in the form of mutual funds, not individual contracts, to enable daily liquidity.

The fair values for assets held by the Pension Plan are based on quoted prices for identical instruments and would be categorized as Level 1 assets under the fair value hierarchy.

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plan
In connection with the Merger, the Corporation assumed the pension plan obligations of Prudential Bancorp, under the Prudential Bancorp Pension Plan, that had previously been closed to new Prudential Bancorp participants.  
123
The Prudential Bancorp Pension Plan is structured as a multiple employer plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c). It maintains a single trust and all assets are commingled and invested on a pooled basis. All amounts payable by the Plan are a general charge upon all its assets. This structure gives rise to the risk if a participating employer fails before funding up to cover the liabilities of its participants and orphans, contributions for all remaining employers will increase, as assets have to be re-allocated to cover such shortfall.

Postretirement Benefits
The Corporation provides medical benefits and life insurance benefits under the Postretirement Plan to certain retired full-time employees who were employees of the Corporation prior to January 1, 1998. Prior to February 1, 2014, certain full-time employees became eligible for these discretionary benefits if they reached retirement age while working for the Corporation. The Corporation recognizes the funded status of the Postretirement Plan on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes the changes in that funded status through OCI.

The valuation techniques used to measure fair value for the items in the preceding tables are as follows:
Loans held for sale
 - This category includes mortgage loans held for sale that are measured at fair value. Fair values as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were measured as the price that secondary market investors were offering for loans with similar characteristics. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for details related to the Corporation's election to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
Available for sale investment securities
 - Included in this asset category are debt securities. Level 2 investment securities are valued by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service uses pricing models that vary based on asset class and incorporate available market information, including quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics. Because many fixed 
127
income securities do not trade on a daily basis, pricing models use available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark yield curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing.
Standard market inputs include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data, including market research publications. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the standard market inputs may not be applicable.
•
U.S. Government securities
 - These securities are classified as Level 1. Fair values are based on quoted prices with active markets.
•
U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities/State and municipal securities/Collateralized mortgage obligations/Residential mortgage-backed securities/Commercial mortgage-backed securities
 - These debt securities are classified as Level 2. Fair values are determined by a third-party pricing service, as detailed above.
•
Corporate debt securities
 - These securities are classified as Level 2. This category consists of subordinated and senior debt issued by financial institutions ($
293.1
 million

at December 31, 2024

and $
433.4
 million at December 31, 2023) and other corporate debt issued by non-financial institutions ($
7.3
 million

at December 31, 2024

and $
7.2
 million at December 31, 2023). The fair values for corporate debt securities are determined by a third-party pricing service as detailed above.
Investments held in Rabbi Trust
 - This category consists of mutual funds that are held in trust for employee deferred compensation plans that the Corporation has elected to measure at fair value. Shares of mutual funds are valued based on net asset value, which represents quoted market prices for the underlying shares held in the mutual funds, and as such, are classified as Level 1.
Derivative assets
 - Fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts classified as Level 1 assets ($
1.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
0.6
 million at December 31, 2023). The foreign exchange prices used to measure these items at fair value are based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 assets, representing the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives in the form of interest rate locks and forward commitments with secondary market investors ($
0.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
0.5
 million at December 31, 2023) and the fair value of interest rate derivatives ($
159.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
157.1
 million at December 31, 2023). The fair values of the interest rate locks, forward commitments and interest rate derivatives represent the amounts that would be required to settle the derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date. See "Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments," for additional information.
Deferred compensation liabilities
 - Fair value of amounts due to employees under deferred compensation plans, classified as Level 1 liabilities and are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these liabilities are determined in the same manner as the related assets, as described under the heading "Investments held in Rabbi Trust" above.
Derivative liabilities
 - Level 1 liabilities, representing the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts ($
1.6
 million and $
0.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively).
Level 2 liabilities, representing the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives in the form of interest rate locks and forward commitments with secondary market investors ($
0.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
0.9
 million at December 31, 2023) and the fair value of interest rate derivatives ($
252.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
245.6
 million at December 31, 2023).
The fair values of these liabilities are determined in the same manner as the related assets, as described under the heading "Derivative assets" above.
128
Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value measurement in certain circumstances, such as upon their acquisition or when there is evidence of impairment. The following table presents Level 3 financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

 Amounts shown are estimated fair value. MSRs are recorded on the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at lower of amortized cost or fair value. See
    "Note 8 - Mortgage Servicing Rights" for additional information.
The valuation techniques used to measure fair value for the items in the table above are as follows:
•
Loans, net
 – This category consists of loans that were individually evaluated for impairment and have been classified as Level 3 assets. The amount shown is the balance of non-accrual loans, net of related ACL. See "Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses," for additional details. 
•
OREO
 – This category consists of OREO classified as Level 3 assets, for which the fair values were based on estimated selling prices less estimated selling costs for similar assets in active markets.
•
MSRs
 – This category consists of MSRs, which were initially recorded at fair value upon the sale of residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors, and subsequently carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. MSRs are amortized as a reduction to servicing income over the estimated lives of the underlying loans. MSRs are stratified by product type and evaluated for impairment by comparing each stratum's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Fair values are determined at the end of each quarter through a discounted cash flows valuation performed by a third-party valuation expert. Significant inputs to the valuation included expected net servicing income, the discount rate and the expected life of the underlying loans. Expected life is based on the contractual terms of the loans, as adjusted for prepayment projections. The weighted average annual constant prepayment rate and the weighted average discount rate used in the December 31, 2024 valuation were 
7.9
% and 
9.5
%, respectively. Management reviews the reasonableness of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation in comparison to market data. See "Note 8 - Mortgage Servicing Rights," for additional information. 
Changes in any of those inputs, in isolation, could result in a significantly different fair value measurement, as depicted in the table below:

SBA servicing asset
 – This category consists of the retained servicing rights on SBA-guaranteed loans sold to investors. The standard sale structure under the SBA Secondary Participation Guaranty Agreement provides for the Corporation to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the SBA guaranteed portion of the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. A third-party valuation expert is utilized to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of the SBA servicing asset. Since the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs, the SBA servicing asset is classified within Level 3.
129
The following table details the book values and the estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. A general description of the methods and assumptions used to estimate such fair values is also provided.

Fair values of financial instruments are significantly affected by the assumptions used, principally the timing of future cash flows and discount rates. Because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature, the estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes and, in many cases, the estimated fair values could not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument. The aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent management's estimate of the underlying value of the Corporation. 
130
For short-term financial instruments, defined as those with remaining maturities of 90 days or less, and excluding those recorded at fair value on the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets, book value was considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The following instruments are predominantly short-term:
Assets

Liabilities
Cash and cash equivalents

Demand and savings deposits
Accrued interest receivable

Other borrowings

Accrued interest payable
FRB and FHLB stock represent restricted investments and are carried at cost on the consolidated balance sheets, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
As of December 31, 2024, fair values for loans and time deposits were estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current rates, as adjusted for liquidity considerations, at which similar loans would be made to borrowers and similar deposits would be issued to customers for the same remaining maturities. Fair values of loans also include estimated credit losses that would be assumed in a market transaction, which represents estimated exit prices.
Brokered deposits consist of demand and saving deposits, which are classified as Level 1, and time deposits, which are classified as Level 2. The fair value of these deposits is determined in a manner consistent with the respective type of deposit discussed above.
NOTE 20 - SEGMENT REPORTING
The Corporation has 
one
 reportable segment whose primary sources of revenue are interest income on loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and fee income earned on its products and services. Its expenses consist of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, provision for credit losses, other operating expenses and income taxes. The Corporation manages its business activities on a consolidated basis.
The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who assesses performance of the segment based on net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per share (diluted), which is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per share (diluted), are used to monitor actual results versus budget, in competitive analyses by benchmarking to the Corporation’s peers, and in decision-making pertaining to executive compensation levels, common stock and preferred stock dividend levels, common share repurchases and capital expenditure spending.
The measure of segment assets is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 21 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with OBS risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its borrowers or obligors.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a borrower or obligor as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower or obligor. Since a portion of the commitments is expected to expire without being drawn 
132
upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each borrower's or obligor's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, if any, obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower or obligor. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, equipment and income-producing commercial properties. 
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a borrower or obligor to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to facilitate foreign and domestic trade transactions for borrowers or obligors. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is similar to that involved in extending loan facilities. These obligations are underwritten consistent with commercial lending standards. The maximum exposure to loss for standby and commercial letters of credit is equal to the contractual (or notional) amount of the instruments.
The following table presents the Corporation's commitments to extend credit and letters of credit:

Residential Lending
The Corporation originates and sells residential mortgages to secondary market investors. The Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to secondary market investors that specify, among other things, that the loans have been underwritten to the standards of the secondary market investor. The Corporation may be required to repurchase specific loans or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a sold loan if it is determined that the representations and warranties have not been met. Under some agreements with secondary market investors, the Corporation may have additional credit exposure beyond customary representations and warranties, based on the specific terms of those agreements.
The Corporation maintains a reserve for estimated losses related to loans sold to investors. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total reserve for losses on residential mortgage loans sold was $
1.5
 million and $
1.8
 million, respectively, including reserves for both representation and warranty and credit loss exposures. In addition, included as a component of ACL for OBS credit exposures was $
1.2
 million and $
2.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to additional credit exposure for potential loan repurchases.
Legal Proceedings
The Corporation is involved in various pending and threatened claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Corporation evaluates the possible impact of these matters, taking into consideration the most recent information available. A loss reserve is established for those matters for which the Corporation believes a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Once established, the reserve is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments. Actual losses with respect to any such matter may be more or less than the amount estimated by the Corporation. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated by the Corporation, no loss reserve is established.
In addition, from time to time, the Corporation is involved in investigations or other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry covering a range of possible issues and, in some cases, these may be part of similar reviews of the specified activities of other companies. These inquiries or investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings involving the Corporation, and could result in fines, penalties, restitution, other types of sanctions, or the need for the Corporation to undertake remedial actions, or to alter its business, financial or accounting practices. The Corporation's practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations.
133
As of the date of this report, the Corporation believes that any liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, that may result from the final outcomes of pending legal proceedings, or regulatory or governmental inquiries or investigations, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. However, legal proceedings, inquiries and investigations are often unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's results of operations in any future period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the period, and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business. In addition, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceeding, inquiry or investigation, any such matter could cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and possibly material, to the Corporation's results of operations in any future period.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of Fulton Financial Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Fulton Financial Corporation's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Republic First Transaction was completed on April 26, 2024, as further discussed in "Note 2—Business Combinations." System conversion was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Corporation acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. The scope of management's assessment of effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, excludes the internal control over financial reporting associated with total acquired assets of approximately $4.8 billion and total net revenues of $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors
Fulton Financial Corporation:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fulton Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. The scope of management's assessment of effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, excludes the internal control over financial reporting associated with total acquired assets of approximately $4.8 billion and total net revenues of $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Republic First Bank.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
138
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of the allowance for credit losses related to loans evaluated collectively for expected credit losses
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses related to loans evaluated collectively for expected credit losses (collective ACL) was $362.3 million of a total allowance for credit losses of $379.2 million as of December 31, 2024. The collective ACL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for those loans and leases that share similar risk characteristics and uses an undiscounted approach. The Company estimates the collective ACL by applying a probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) to the exposure at default (EAD) at the loan level. The PD models are econometric regression models that utilize the Company’s historical credit loss experience and incorporate a reasonable and supportable economic forecast through the use of externally developed macroeconomic scenarios. After a reasonable and supportable forecast period, the forecasted PD rates revert back to a historical average PD rate. The LGD model calculates an LGD estimate for each loan pool utilizing a loss rate approach that is based on the Company’s historical charge-off experience. The EAD calculation incorporates constant pre-payment rates, and inputs related to loan level cash flows, maturity dates, and interest rates. The constant pre-payment rates utilized in the EAD calculation are sourced from a prepayment calculation that utilizes the Company’s historical loan prepayment history to develop prepayment speeds. The collective ACL also includes qualitative reserve adjustments for factors that are not fully captured in the quantitative models.
We identified the assessment of the valuation of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. Such assessment involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring especially complex auditor judgment, and specialized skills and knowledge of the industry. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. The assessment of the collective ACL encompassed the evaluation of the overall ACL methodology, which includes the methods and models used to estimate the PD, LGD, and EAD and their key assumptions and inputs. Key assumptions and inputs used in the estimation of the PD rate include historical default observations, the historical observation period, loan pool segmentation including the use of credit risk ratings for commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans, and a reasonable and supportable economic forecast which includes reversion to historical average default rates. Key assumptions and inputs used in the estimation of the LGD rate include the loan pool segmentation, historical loss observations, and the historical observation period. Key assumptions and inputs used in the estimation of the EAD include a constant prepayment rate (CPR) and loan level cash flow adjustments. Key assumptions and inputs used in the estimation of the CPR include historical prepayment observations, interest rates, the historical observation period, and loan pool segmentation. The assessment also included an evaluation of the qualitative adjustments, including an evaluation of the methods used by management in estimating this reserve. The collective ACL estimate is sensitive to changes in the assumptions discussed above, such that changes in these assumptions can cause significant changes to the estimate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the collective ACL estimate, including controls over the:
•
development of the collective ACL methodology
•
development of the PD and LGD models and of the methods used to calculate the CPR and EAD
139
•
identification and determination of the key inputs and assumptions used in the PD and LGD models, and EAD calculation which included key inputs and assumptions within the pre-payment model
•
performance monitoring of the PD and LGD models
•
development of the qualitative adjustments
•
measurement and on-going monitoring of the overall ACL estimate.
We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, assumptions, and related methodologies. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:
•
evaluating the Company's collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
•
evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used in developing the PD rates, LGD rates, and EAD estimate and judgments made by the Company relative to performance monitoring by inspecting management's model and methodology documentation and through comparisons against Company specific metrics, the Company's business environment, and applicable industry and regulatory practices
•
determining whether loans are pooled by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company's business environment and relevant industry practices
•
testing individual credit ratings for a selection of borrowers by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees and underlying collateral 
•
evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative adjustments by inspecting management's methodology and development documentation and assessing the effects of these factors on the collective ACL estimate compared with relevant industry practices and Company specific metrics.
We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACL estimate by evaluating the cumulative results of the audit procedures, qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices, and potential bias in the accounting estimate.

The Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation's management, including the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon the evaluation, the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
The "Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" and the "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" may be found in "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this document.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Beth Ann L. Chivinski became interim Chief Financial Officer on February 8, 2024. Richard S. Kraemer became Chief Financial Officer on November 1, 2024.
The Republic First Transaction was completed on April 26, 2024, as further discussed in "Note 2—Business Combinations." System conversion was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Corporation acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. The scope of management's assessment of effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, excludes the internal control over financial reporting associated with total acquired assets of approximately $4.8 billion and total net revenues of $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Other than the above, there have been no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting during the Corporation's fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
