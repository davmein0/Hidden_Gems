FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Corporation has made, and may continue to make, certain forward-looking statements with respect to its financial condition, results of operations and business. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "should," "will," "could," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," "projects," the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements may include projections of, or guidance on, the Corporation's future financial performance, expected levels of future expenses, including future credit losses, anticipated growth strategies, descriptions of new business initiatives and anticipated trends in the Corporation's business or financial results.
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts, nor assurance of future performance. Instead, the statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of the Corporation's business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Corporation's control, and actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement is based only on information currently available and speaks only as of the date when made. The Corporation undertakes no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Many factors could affect future financial results including, without limitation:
•
the impact of adverse conditions in the economy and financial markets, including elevated interest rates, on the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolio and demand for the Corporation's products and services;
•
the potential impacts of events affecting the financial services industry on the Corporation, including increased competition for, and costs of, deposits and other funding sources, more stringent regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and interest rate risk management and capital adequacy and increased FDIC insurance expenses;
•
the effects of actions by the federal government, including those of the Federal Reserve Board and other government agencies, that impact the money supply and market interest rates;
•
the effects of market interest rates, and the relative balances of interest rate-sensitive assets to interest rate-sensitive liabilities, on NIM and net interest income; 
•
the composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio, including commercial mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, which collectively represent a majority of the loan portfolio, may expose the Corporation to increased credit risk;
•
the effects of changes in interest rates on demand for the Corporation's products and services;
•
investment securities gains and losses, including declines in the fair value of securities which may result in charges to earnings or shareholders' equity;
•
the effects of changes in interest rates or disruptions in liquidity markets on the Corporation's sources of funding;
•
capital and liquidity strategies, including the Corporation's ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, and the Corporation's ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
•
the effects of competition on deposit rates and growth, loan rates and growth and NIM;
•
possible goodwill impairment charges;
•
the impact of operational risks, including the risk of human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, computer and telecommunications systems failures, faulty or incomplete data and an inadequate risk management framework;
•
the loss of, or failure to safeguard, confidential or proprietary information;
•
the Corporation's failure to identify and adequately and promptly address cybersecurity risks, including data breaches and cyberattacks;
•
the impact of failures from third-party vendors upon which the Corporation relies to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements and the effects of concerns about other financial institutions on the Corporation;
•
the potential to incur losses in connection with repurchase and indemnification payments related to sold loans;
•
the potential effects of climate change on the Corporation's business and results of operations;
7
•
the potential effects of increases in non-performing assets, which may require the Corporation to increase the ACL, charge-off loans and incur elevated collection and carrying costs related to such non-performing assets;
•
the determination of the ACL, which depends significantly upon assumptions and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including the performance of the loan portfolio, the weighted-average remaining lives of different classifications of loans within the loan portfolio and current and forecasted economic conditions, among other factors;
•
the effects of the extensive level of regulation and supervision to which the Corporation and Fulton Bank are subject;
•
changes in law, regulation and government policy, which could result in significant changes in banking and financial services regulation;
•
the continuing impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Corporation's business and results of operations;
•
the potential for negative consequences resulting from regulatory violations, investigations and examinations, including potential supervisory actions, the assessment of fines and penalties, the imposition of sanctions, the need to undertake remedial actions and possible damage to the Corporation's reputation;
•
the effects of adverse outcomes in litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings;
•
the effects of changes in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws;
•
the effects of the significant amounts of time and expense associated with regulatory compliance and risk management;
•
The Corporation's ability to realize anticipated reductions in non-interest expense and increases in revenue from strategic initiatives implemented from time to time intended to simplify its operating model, improve its relationship banking focus, increase productivity and enhance the customer experience;
•
completed and potential acquisitions may affect costs and the Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions;
•
geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism, actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, which could impact business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad;
•
public health crises and pandemics and their effects on the economic and business environments in which the Corporation operates, including on the Corporation's credit quality and business operations, as well as the impact on general economic and financial market conditions;
•
the Corporation's ability to achieve its growth plans;
•
the Corporation's ability to attract and retain talented personnel;
•
the effects of competition from financial service companies and other companies offering bank services; 
•
the Corporation's ability to keep pace with technological changes;
•
the Corporation's reliance on its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenues and its ability to pay dividends or other distributions; 
•
the effects of negative publicity on the Corporation's reputation; and
•
other factors that may affect future results of the Corporation.
