Banking and Financial Services 
Through our banking subsidiary, Fulton Bank, the Corporation delivers financial services primarily within our five-state market area, comprised of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia, in a personalized, community-oriented style that emphasizes relationship banking. 
The Corporation operates in areas that are home to a wide range of manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and other service companies. Although a large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans, we are not dependent upon one or a few customers and the loss of any single customer or a few customers would not have a material adverse impact on our business.
