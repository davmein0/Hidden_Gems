General.
We have identified one reportable business segment, lime and limestone operations, based on the distinctness of our activities and products. All operations are in the United States. During 2024, we determined that the activities of our natural gas interests did not meet the requirements of an operating segment. Previously unallocated items, including cash, interest income and expense, and other expense are now included as part of our single lime and limestone operations segment. Disclosures for 2023 and 2022 have been recast to be consistent with the 2024 presentation.
Our revenues increased 12.9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products of 14.2%, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in sales volume. This decrease in demand was primarily from our construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our industrial, environmental, and roof shingle customers. Our gross profit increased 40.0% in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the increased revenues discussed above.
Our other (income) expense, net was $11.5 million income in 2024, compared to $7.9 million income in 2023, an increase of $3.5 million.  The increase in other income, net in 2024, compared to 2023, was due to interest earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our net income increased $34.3 
million, or 46.0%, in 2024, compared to 2023.  Net income per fully diluted share increased to $3.79 in 2024, compared to $2.61 in 2023, an increase of 45.2%.
Cash flows from operations enabled us to make $27.4 million of capital investments in 2024.  It also enabled us to pay $5.7 million in dividends in 2024 and increase our cash balances to $278.0 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $188.0 million as of December 31, 2023.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no debt outstanding.
On May 2, 2024, our shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 30,000,000 to 45,000,000. On July 12, 2024, we effected a 5-for-1 split of our common stock, in the form of a stock dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each share outstanding, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2024 (the “Stock Split”). All share and per share information, including stock-based 
26

Table of Contents
compensation, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.10 per share.
On February 3, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared an increased regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share.  The dividend is payable on March 14, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2025.
Absent a significant acquisition opportunity arising during 2025, we anticipate funding our operating and capital needs and our regular cash dividends from our cash balances on hand and cash flows from operations.
Our Operations.
We produce and sell crushed limestone, PLS, aggregate, quicklime, hydrated lime and lime slurry. The principal factors affecting our success are the level of demand and prices for our products and whether we are able to maintain sufficient production levels and product quality while controlling costs.
Adverse weather conditions, such as ice storms, freezing weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, excessive rains, and flooding, generally reduce the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction-related customers that account for a significant amount of our revenues. Inclement weather also interferes with our open-pit mining operations and can disrupt our plant production. In addition to weather, various maintenance, environmental, accident, and other operational and construction issues can also disrupt our operations and increase our operating expenses.
Demand for our lime and limestone products in our market areas is also affected by general economic conditions, the pace of construction, including the level of governmental and private funding for highway construction and infrastructure, utility plant usage of coal for power generation, the demand for steel, and the level of oil and gas drilling in our markets. 
Texas continues to invest heavily in its transportation, including directing certain sales and use tax revenues, state motor vehicle sales and rental tax revenues, and oil and gas tax revenues to the State Highway Fund, as required under the Texas constitution.  In its fiscal 2024, Texas transferred approximately $6.2 billion of such tax revenues to the State Highway Fund. Additionally, for future roadway projects outlined in the Texas Department of Transportation’s 2024 Unified Transportation Program, the state programmed a $15.5 billion increase in funding for a total of $100.6 billion in construction and major maintenance projects planned over the next 10 years.  In 2021, the United States Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is estimated to apportion approximately $27.5 billion to Texas for federal-aid highway programs, of which $16.6 billion has been announced for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects.  With these funding sources, we would expect to see strong continued demand from our construction customers, but the timing and amount of any increase in demand is uncertain and subject to weather, political, economic, and other factors. 
Our modernization and expansion and development projects and acquisitions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri and our Texas slurry operations have positioned us to meet the demand for high-
quality lime and limestone products in our markets.  Our modernization and expansion and development projects have also equipped us with up-to-date, fuel-
efficient plant facilities, which have resulted in lower production costs and greater operating efficiencies, thus enhancing our competitive position.  All of our rotary kilns are now fuel-efficient preheater kilns, and the addition of the vertical kiln at St. 
Clair further increased the fuel efficiency of our fleet of kilns.  Future projects, such as our new kiln project at Texas Lime, will create the opportunity for further fuel efficiency.
For our plants to operate at peak efficiency, we must meet operational challenges that arise from time to time, including bringing new facilities on-line and refurbishing and/or improving acquired facilities, including the facilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of Carthage and Mill Creek, as well as operating existing facilities efficiently. We also incur ongoing costs for maintenance and to remain in compliance with rapidly changing Environmental Laws and health and safety and other regulations.
Our primary variable cost is energy. Prices for coal, petroleum coke, diesel, natural gas, electricity, transportation, and freight are volatile. In addition, our freight costs, including the cost of diesel, to deliver our products can be high relative to the value of our products.
27

Table of Contents
Historically, we have been able to mitigate to some degree the impact of volatile energy costs by varying the mixes of fuel used in our kilns, and by passing on some of any increase in costs to our customers, where possible, through higher prices and/or surcharges on certain products.  In addition, we continually look for other ways to better manage our energy costs at our plants.  Finally, we have not engaged in any significant hedging activity in an effort to control our energy costs but may do so in the future.
We continue to believe that the enhanced efficiency and production capacity resulting from our modernization and expansion and development projects in Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, our expanded slurry operations, our acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Carthage and Mill Creek, and the operational strategies that we have implemented have allowed us to increase our efficiency, grow production capacity, improve product quality, better serve existing customers, attract new customers, and control costs.  However, there can be no assurance that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will enable us to fully utilize any additional production capacity, nor that our production will not be adversely affected by weather, maintenance, regulatory, accident, cybersecurity, and other operational and construction issues; that we can successfully invest in improvements to our existing facilities and acquisitions; that our results will not be adversely affected by increases in fuel, natural gas, electricity, transportation and freight costs, taxes, or new environmental, health and safety, or other regulatory requirements; or that, with increasing competition with other lime and limestone producers, our revenues, gross profit, net income, and cash flows can be maintained or improved.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions and historical trends.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Contingencies.
  We are party to proceedings, lawsuits, and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to regulatory, labor, product, and other matters. We are required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter, including coverage under our insurance policies. This determination may change in the future because of new information or developments.
Income taxes.  
We utilize the asset and liability approach in reporting our income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Income tax related interest and penalties are included in income tax expense.  We also assess individual tax positions to determine if they meet the criteria for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in our financial statements and only recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
Environmental costs and liabilities.
  We record environmental accruals, including accrued reclamation costs, in other liabilities, based on studies and estimates, when it is probable we have incurred a reasonably estimable cost or liability. The accruals are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. Environmental expenditures that extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety or efficiency of Company-owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future possible environmental issues are capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred.

2024 vs. 2023
Our revenues in 2024 increased to $317.7 million from $281.3 
million in 2023, an increase of $36.4 million, or 12.9%. The increase in revenues in 2024 was due to a 14.2% increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to decreased demand from our construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our industrial, environmental, and roof shingle customers.  
Our gross profit increased to $144.0 million in 2024 from $102.9 million in 2023, an increase of $41.1 million, or 40.0%. The increase in gross profit in 2024, compared to 2023, resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased to $19.1 million in 2024, an increase of $1.6 million, or 9.2%, compared to $17.4 million in 2023. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A was 5.9% in 2024, compared to 6.2% in 2023.  The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, in 2024, compared to 2023.
Other (income) expense, net was $11.5 million income in 2024, compared to $7.9 million income in 2023, an increase of $3.5 million. The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2024 compared to 2023, was due to interest earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Income tax expense was $27.5 million in 2024, for an effective rate of 20.2%, compared to $18.8 million in 2023, for an effective rate of 20.2%, an increase of $8.7 million, primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2024, compared to 2023.  Our effective income tax rates in 2024 and 2023 were reduced from the statutory rate primarily due to statutory depletion in excess of basis.
Net income increased to $108.8 million ($3.79 per share diluted) in 2024, compared to $74.5 million ($2.61 per share diluted) in 2023, an increase of $34.3 million, or 46.0%.
2023 vs. 2022
Our revenues in 2023 increased to $281.3 million from $236.2 million in 2022, an increase of $45.2 million, or 19.1%. The increase in revenues in 2023 was due to a 21.1% increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products, partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily 
29

Table of Contents
due to decreased demand from our industrial, steel, and construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our roofing, environmental, and oil and gas services customers.  
Our gross profit increased to $102.9 million in 2023 from $70.3 
million in 2022, an increase of $32.5 million, or 46.2%. The increase in gross profit in 2023, compared to 2022, resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased lime and limestone production costs, principally from higher energy, labor, and parts and supplies costs.  
SG&A increased to $17.4 million in 2023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.1%, compared to $15.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A was 6.2% in 2023, compared to 6.6% in 2022.  The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased personnel expenses in 2023, compared to 2022.
Other (income) expense, net was $7.9 million income in 2023, compared to $1.8 million income in 2022, an increase of $6.2 million.  The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was due to higher interest rates earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Income tax expense was $18.8 million in 2023, for an effective rate of 20.2%, compared to $11.1 million in 2022, for an effective rate of 19.7%, an increase of $7.7 million, primarily due to the increase in income before taxes in 2023, compared to 2022.  Our effective income tax rates in 2023 and 2022 were reduced from the statutory rate primarily due to statutory depletion in excess of basis.
Net income increased to $74.5 million ($2.61 per share diluted) in 2023, compared to $45.4 million ($1.60 per share diluted) in 2022, an increase of $29.1 million, or 64.1%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION.
Capital Requirements.
  We require capital primarily for normal recurring capital and re-
equipping projects, modernization and expansion and development projects, and acquisitions.  Our capital needs are expected to be met principally from cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility.
30

Table of Contents
We expect to spend approximately $22.0 million per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital and re-equipping projects at our plants and facilities to maintain or improve efficiency, ensure compliance with Environmental Laws, meet customer needs, and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $35.5 million in open orders for equipment and construction contracts, including $32.5 million of contractual obligations relating to the new kiln project at Texas Lime.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $126.0 million in 2024, compared to $92.3 million in 2023, an increase of $33.8 million, or 36.6%. Our net cash provided by operating activities is composed of net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”), other non-cash items included in net income, and changes in working capital. In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was principally composed of $108.8 million net income, $24.2 million DD&A, and $4.9 million stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in deferred income taxes and an $11.0 million decrease from changes in working capital. In 2024, the changes in working capital were principally composed of a $5.9 million increase in trade receivables, net, primarily as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter 2024, compared to the fourth quarter 2023, a $3.4 million increase in inventories, primarily due to increases in the costs of our supply of critical parts and the volume of our solid fuel stockpiles, and a $1.0 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. In 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was principally composed of $74.5 million net income, $23.8 million DD&A, and $3.2 million stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in deferred income taxes and an $8.8 million decrease from changes in working capital. In 2023, the changes in working capital were principally composed of a $4.5 million increase in trade receivables, net, primarily as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to the fourth quarter 2022, a $4.7 million increase in inventories, primarily due to increases in the volume of our solid fuel stockpiles and the costs of our supply of critical parts, and a $1.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash used in investing activities was $26.9 million for 2024, compared to $32.0 million for 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for 2024 included $1.4 million on the new kiln and related equipment and infrastructure project at Texas Lime and $1.6 million for real property purchases. Net cash used in investing activities for 2023 included $11.0 million for real property purchases. 
Net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $5.7 million for dividend payments and $3.5 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2024, compared to $4.6 million for dividend payments and $1.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2023.
Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 increased to $278.0 million from $188.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
Banking Facilities and Debt.
  Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”), as amended as of August 3, 2023, provides for a $75 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and an incremental four-year accordion feature to borrow up to an additional $50 million on the same terms, subject to approval by the Lender or another lender selected by us. The credit agreement also provides for a $10 million letter of credit sublimit under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility and any incremental loans mature on August 3, 2028
.
Interest rates on the Revolving Facility are, at our option, SOFR, plus a SOFR adjustment rate of 0.10%, plus a margin of 1.000% to 2.000%, or the Lender’s Prime Rate, plus a margin of 0.000% to 1.000%, and a commitment fee range of 0.225% to 0.350% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility interest rate margins and commitment fee are determined quarterly in accordance with a pricing grid based upon our Cash Flow Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio of our total funded senior indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) for the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, plus pro forma EBITDA from any businesses acquired during the period.  Pursuant to a security agreement, dated August 25, 2004, the Revolving Facility is secured by our existing and hereafter acquired tangible assets, intangible assets, and real property. The maturity of the Revolving Facility and any incremental loans can be accelerated if any event of default, as defined under the credit agreement, occurs.  Our maximum Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is 3.50 to 1.
We may pay dividends so long as we remain in compliance with the provisions of our credit agreement, and we may purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock so long as our pro forma Cash Flow Leverage 
31

Table of Contents
Ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 and no default or event of default exists or would exist after giving effect to such stock repurchase.
At December 31, 2024, we had no debt outstanding and no draws on the Revolving Facility other than $6.6 million of letters of credit, which count as draws against the available commitment under the Revolving Facility.
Common Stock Buybacks.
  We spent $3.5 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, to repurchase treasury shares tendered for payment of the exercise price for stock options and the tax withholding liability upon the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock.

Represents operating leases for railcars, corporate office space, and some equipment that are either non-cancelable or subject to significant penalty upon cancellation.

Of these obligations, $1,657 were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024.
(3)
Purchase obligations includes enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, generally pertaining to fuel contracts, fixed-price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction, and are either non-cancelable or subject to significant penalty upon cancellation, including $32.5 million related to the Texas kiln project.
Absent a significant acquisition, we believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating needs, ongoing capital needs, including our current and possible future modernization and expansion and development projects, such as the Texas kiln project, and liquidity needs and allow us to pay our increased regular cash dividends for the near future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
  We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
 ABOUT MARKET RISK.
INTEREST RATE RISK.
We could be exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of floating interest rates on the Revolving Facility. There was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility subject to interest rate risk at December 31, 2024.  Any future borrowings under the Revolving Facility would be subject to interest rate risk. Additionally, our cash and cash equivalents earn interest which is reported in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. A future decrease in interest rates could reduce the amount of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents.

Opinion on the financial statements 
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (a Texas corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
​
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
​
​
​
Basis for opinion 
​
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion on internal 
control over financial reporting
​
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (a Texas corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
​
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
​
​
​
Basis for opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary 
of
 Significant Accounting Policies
(a)         Organization and Presentation
United States Lime 
& Minerals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a manufacturer of lime and limestone products, supplying primarily the construction (including highway, road, and building contractors), industrial (including paper and glass manufacturers), environmental (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), metals (including steel producers), roof shingle manufacturers, agriculture (including poultry producers),  and oil and gas services industries. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and operates lime and limestone plants and distribution facilities in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Arkansas Lime Company, ART Quarry TRS LLC (DBA Carthage Crushed Limestone), Colorado Lime Company, Mill Creek Dolomite, LLC, Texas Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company-Shreveport, U.S. Lime Company-St. Clair, and U.S. Lime Company-Transportation.  In addition, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Lime Company-O & G, LLC, has royalty and non-operated working interests in natural gas wells located in Johnson County, Texas, in the Barnett Shale Formation.
On May 2, 2024, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the Company’s number of authorized shares of common stock from 
30,000,000
 to 
45,000,000
.  On July 12, 2024, the Company effected a 
5
-for-1 split of its common stock in the form of a stock dividend of 
four
 additional shares of common stock for each share outstanding to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2024 (the “Stock Split”).  All share and per share information, including stock-based compensation, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.  The shares of common stock retain a par value of 
$
0.10
 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the additional shares issued in the Stock Split was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to common stock for all periods presented.
The number and terms of stock-based compensation awards outstanding on the date of the Stock Split were adjusted, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants under the Company’s 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (the “Plan”).  The fair value of all outstanding awards immediately after the Stock Split did not change when compared to the fair value of such awards immediately prior to the Stock Split. In addition, there was no change to the vesting conditions or classification of any of the awards. No incremental compensation expense was recognized as a result of such adjustments.
(b)         Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
(c)         Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.

​
(d)         Statements of Cash Flows
For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid debt instruments, such as United States Treasury bills and notes, with maturities, at the time of purchase, of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair market value. Supplemental cash flow information is presented below:

(e)         Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue for its lime and limestone operations when (i) a contract with the customer exists and the performance obligations are identified; (ii) the price has been established; and (iii) the performance obligations have been satisfied, which is at a point in time, generally upon shipment.  Revenues include external freight billed to customers with related costs accounted for as fulfillment costs and included in cost of revenues.  The Company operates within a single geographic region. The Company’s returns and allowances are minimal.  External freight billed to customers included in revenues was 
$
45,514
, $
46,270
, and $
44,233
 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which approximates the amount of external freight included in cost of revenues. Sales taxes billed to customers are not included in revenues. 
(f)         Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.”  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
(g)         Concentration of Credit Risk and Trade Receivables
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions and in highly rated commercial paper or United States Treasury bills and notes with maturities, at the time of purchase, of three months or less.  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at commercial banking institutions normally exceed federally insured limits.
The majority of the Company’s trade receivables are unsecured. Payment terms for all trade receivables are based on the underlying purchase orders, contracts, or purchase agreements, and are generally fixed, short-term, and do not contain a significant financing component.  The Company estimates credit losses relating to trade receivables based on an assessment of the current and forecasted probability of collection, historical trends, economic conditions, and other significant events that may impact the collectability of trade receivables.  Due to the relatively homogenous nature of its trade receivables, the Company does not believe there is any meaningful asset-specific differences within its accounts receivable portfolio that would require the portfolio to be grouped below the consolidated level for review of credit losses. Credit losses relating to trade receivables have generally been within management expectations and historical trends. Uncollected trade receivables are

(i)         Property, Plant and Equipment
For major constructed assets, the capitalized cost includes the price paid by the Company for labor and materials plus interest and internal and external project management costs that are directly related to the constructed assets. Machinery and equipment at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included $
8,098
 and $
6,001
, respectively, of construction in progress for various capital projects. 
No
 interest costs were capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts payable and accrued expenses included $
1,657
 and $
1,196
, respectively, of capitalized costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included depreciation expense of $
318
, $
294
, and $
278
 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is being provided for by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:

​
​
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. When units of property are retired or otherwise disposed of, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income.

​
The Company expenses all exploration costs as incurred, as well as costs incurred at an operating quarry or mine, other than capital expenditures and inventory. Costs to acquire mineral reserves are capitalized upon acquisition. Costs incurred to develop new mineral reserves, to expand the capacity of a quarry or mine, or to develop quarry or mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized once proven and probable reserves exist and can be economically produced. For each quarry or mine, capitalized costs to acquire and develop mineral reserves are depleted using the units-of-production method based on the proven and probable reserves for such quarry or mine.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment and, when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines if impairment of value exists. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment exists, and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded. If an impairment exists, the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value. Any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset. The Company had 
no
 impairments in the years presented in the financial statements.
​
(j)         Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company recognizes legal obligations for reclamation and remediation associated with the retirement of long-
lived assets at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred (“AROs”). Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion expense, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the AROs for the recorded amount or recognizes a gain or loss.  The Company’s AROs of 
$
1,484
 and $
1,548
 as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in Other liabilities and Accrued expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, assets, net of accumulated depreciation, associated with the Company’s AROs totaled 
$
580
.  During 2024 and 2023, the Company spent 
$
94
 and $
36
, respectively, on its AROs, and recognized accretion expense of $
102
, $
99
, and $
97
 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, on its AROs.
The AROs were estimated based on studies and the Company’s process knowledge and estimates and are discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate. The AROs are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. The Company estimates annual expenditures of approximately $
100
 per year in years 2025 through 2029 relating to its AROs.

​
(l)         Environmental Expenditures
Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded at their present value when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals will coincide with completion of a feasibility study or the Company’s commitment to a formal plan of action.
The Company incurred capital expenditures related to environmental matters of $
997
 in 2024, $
1,456
 in 2023, and $

 in 2022.

The Company expenses all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
(o)         Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability approach in its reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances

​
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Income tax related interest and penalties are included in income tax expense.
The Company also assesses individual tax positions to determine if they meet the criteria for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in the Company’s financial statements. The Company only recognizes tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
(p) 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
Segment Reporting – In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance that expands segment disclosures for public entities, including requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and allocating resources (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 also expands disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets in interim periods and clarifies that a 
public entity may report additional measures of segment profit if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 does not remove existing segment disclosure requirements or change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or determines its reportable segments. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter 2024.  See Note (9) Business Segment. 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures – In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance that expands income tax disclosures for public entities, including requiring enhanced disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual disclosures for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures - In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2024-03 is to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of ASU 2024-03 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Company’s Cash Flow Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio of the Company’s total funded senior indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) for the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, plus pro forma EBITDA from any businesses acquired during the period.  Pursuant to a security agreement, dated August 25, 2004, the Revolving Facility is secured by the Company’s existing and hereafter acquired tangible assets, intangible assets, and real property.  The maturity of the Revolving Facility and any incremental loans can be accelerated if any event of default, as defined under the credit agreement, occurs.  The Company’s maximum Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is 
3.50
 to 1.
The Company may pay dividends so long as it remains in compliance with the provisions of the Company’s credit agreement, and may purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire shares of its common stock so long as its pro forma Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is less than 
3.00
 to 1.00 and no default or event of default exists or would exist after giving effect to such stock repurchase.

The Company had 
no
 federal net operating loss carry forwards at December 31, 2024. The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets are considered fully recognizable because of the Company’s recent income history and expectations of income in the future.  The Company’s federal income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent years remain subject to examination.  The Company’s income tax returns in certain state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subsequent years.

There were

 non-vested stock options at December 31, 2024, and the weighted-average remaining contractual life of the outstanding and exercisable stock options at such date was 
5.92
 years. The total compensation cost not yet recognized for restricted stock at December 31, 2024 was $
7,190
, which will be recognized over the weighted average of 
1.04
 years.
The fair value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for the 2024, 2023, and 2022 grants: risk-free interest rates of 
4.57
% in 2024, 
3.41
% to 
3.84
% (weighted average 
3.74
%) in 2023, and 
2.92
% to 
3.94
% (weighted average 
3.74
%) in 2022; a dividend yield of 
0.31
% in 2024, 
0.35
% to 
0.48
% (weighted average 
0.39
%) in 2023, and 
0.57
% to 
0.73
% (weighted average 
0.62
%) in 2022; and a volatility factor of 
.406
 in 2024, 
.389
 to 
.400
 (weighted average 
.397
) in 2023, and 
.374
 to 
.385
 (weighted average 
.382
) in 2022, based on the daily per-share closing prices for 
five years
 preceding the date of issuance. In addition, the fair value of these options was estimated based on an expected life of 
five years
. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the closing per-share price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

Share Repurchases
During 2024, pursuant to provisions in the Plan that allow employees and directors to pay the tax withholding liability upon the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock in either cash and/or delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock, the Company repurchased 
28,028

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is party to lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position.
The Company is not contractually committed to any planned capital expenditures until actual orders are placed for equipment or services. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
35,480
 for open equipment and construction contracts.
(9) 
Reportable Segment
In November 2023, the FASB amended guidance in ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting 
(“ASC 280”) by issuing ASU 2023-07, which updated the disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.  The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter 2024, with retrospective application to the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022.  See Note 1(p).
The Company is managed as 
one
 reportable segment, lime and limestone operations, based on the distinctness of the Company’s activities and products.  All operations are in the United States.  During 2024, the Company determined that the activities of its natural gas interests and the associated level of review of those activities by the CODM precluded the natural gas activities from meeting the definition of an operating segment, as provided in ASC 280.  In addition, previously unallocated items, including cash, interest income and expense and other expense are now included as part of lime and limestone operations, and consolidated net income is now used as the measure of segment profit or loss.  Segment disclosures for 2023 and 2022 have been recast to be consistent with the 2024 presentation.
The Company’s CODM is the chief executive officer.  The lime and limestone operations segment derives revenues from the sale of crushed limestone, pulverized limestone, aggregate, quicklime, hydrated lime, and lime slurry.  The accounting policies of the lime and limestone operations segment are the same as those described in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
In evaluating the operating results of the Company, the CODM assesses performance for the lime and limestone operations segment and decides how to allocate resources (including, but not limited to, decisions on fuel blends, capital purchases, and staffing levels) based on net income that is also reported on the consolidated statements of income.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as “Total assets” and the measure of segment capital expenditures is reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows as “Purchase of property, plant, and equipment.”

ITEM 9A.  CONTROL
S AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
  The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report were effective.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). Based on the assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
  No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
