General.
United States Lime & Minerals, 
Inc. (the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “We” or “Our”), which was incorporated in 1950, conducts its business primarily through its lime and limestone operations.  The Company also has natural gas interests with respect to oil and gas rights in Johnson County, Texas.  In 2024, the Company determined that the activities of its natural gas interests did not meet the definition of an operating segment and has updated the disclosures in this Form 10-K accordingly.  Disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been recast to be consistent with the current year presentation.  See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K.
The Company’s principal corporate office is located at 5429 LBJ Freeway, Suite 230, Dallas, Texas 75240. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 991-8400 and its internet address is www.uslm.com. The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on the Company’s website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Company Operations.
Business and Products.
  The Company is a manufacturer of lime and limestone products, supplying primarily the construction (including highway, road, and building contractors), industrial (including paper and glass manufacturers), environmental (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), metals (including steel producers), roof shingle manufacturers, agriculture (including poultry producers), and oil and gas services industries. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and operates lime and limestone plants and distribution facilities in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Arkansas Lime Company, ART Quarry TRS LLC (DBA Carthage Crushed Limestone), Colorado Lime Company, Mill Creek Dolomite, LLC, Texas Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company-Shreveport, U.S. Lime Company-St. Clair and U.S. Lime Company-Transportation.
The Company produces high-quality limestone from its open-
pit quarries and underground mines that it sells as crushed limestone or processes further to produce several higher-value lime and limestone products, including pulverized limestone (“PLS”), quicklime, hydrated lime, and lime slurry.  PLS (also referred to as ground calcium carbonate) is produced by applying heat to dry the limestone, which is then ground to granular and finer sizes. Quicklime (calcium oxide) is produced by heating limestone to very high temperatures in kilns in a process called calcination. Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) is produced by reacting quicklime with water in a controlled process. Lime slurry (milk of lime) is a suspended solution of calcium hydroxide produced by mixing quicklime with water in a lime slaker.
Crushed limestone is used primarily in construction aggregates.  PLS is used in the production of construction materials, such as roof shingles and asphalt paving, as an additive to agriculture feeds, in the production of glass, as an agricultural soil enhancement, in flue gas treatment for utilities and other industries requiring scrubbing of emissions for environmental purposes and for mine safety dust in coal mining operations. Quicklime is used primarily in metal processing, in flue gas treatment, in soil stabilization for highway, road, and building construction, as well as for oilfield roads and drill sites, in the manufacturing of paper products, and in municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities. Hydrated lime is used primarily in municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities, in soil stabilization for highway, road, and building construction, in flue gas treatment, in asphalt as an anti-stripping agent, as a conditioning agent for oil and gas drilling mud, and in the production of chemicals. Lime slurry is used primarily in soil stabilization for highway, road and building construction.
Product Sales.
  In 2024, the Company sold almost all of its lime and limestone products in the states of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.  Sales were made primarily by the Company’s eight sales employees who call on current and potential customers and solicit orders, which are

generally made on a purchase-order basis. The Company also receives orders in response to bids that it prepares and submits to current and potential customers.
Principal customers for the Company’s lime and limestone products are construction customers (including highway, road, and building contractors), industrial customers (including paper manufacturers and glass manufacturers), environmental customers (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), metals producers (including steel producers), roof shingle manufacturers, agriculture (including poultry producers), and oil and gas services companies. 
Approximately 675 customers accounted for the Company’s sales of lime and limestone products during 2024. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of such sales. The Company is generally not subject to significant customer demand and credit risks as its customers are considerably diversified within its geographic region and by industry concentration. However, given the nature of the lime and limestone industry, the Company’s profits are very sensitive to changes in sales volumes, prices, and costs.
Lime and limestone products are transported by truck and rail to customers generally within a radius of 400 miles of each of the Company’s plants. All of the Company’s 2024 sales were made within the United States.
Seasonality.
  The Company’s sales have typically reflected seasonal trends, with the largest percentage of total annual shipments and revenues normally being realized in the second and third quarters. Lower seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions generally have a negative impact on the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction-related customers, as well as on the Company’s open-pit quarrying operations.
Limestone Mineral Resources and Reserves.
  The Company’s limestone mineral resources and reserves contain at least 96% calcium carbonate (CaCO
3
). The Company has four subsidiaries that extract limestone from open-pit quarries: Texas Lime Company (“Texas Lime”), which operates the Texas Lime Quarry and is located near Cleburne, Texas; Arkansas Lime Company (“Arkansas Lime”), which operates the Batesville Quarry and is located near Batesville, Arkansas; ACT Holdings, Inc. (“ACT”), which owns the Love Hollow Quarry and is located near Cushman, Arkansas; and Mill Creek Dolomite, LLC (“Mill Creek”), which operates the Mill Creek Quarry and is located near Mill Creek, Oklahoma. U.S. Lime Company-St. Clair (“St. 
Clair”) extracts limestone from the St. Clair Mine, an underground mine located near Marble City, Oklahoma.  Carthage Crushed Limestone (“Carthage”) extracts limestone from the Carthage Mine, an underground mine located in Carthage, Missouri.  Colorado Lime Company (“Colorado Lime”) owns property containing limestone deposits at Monarch Pass, Colorado. Existing crushed limestone stockpiles on the property are being used to provide feedstock to the Company’s plant in Delta, Colorado. Access to all properties is provided by paved roads and, in the case of Arkansas Lime, St. Clair, Carthage, and Mill Creek, also by rail.
The following table shows annual mined tons of limestone (in thousands) at the Company’s mining properties for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

During 2023, the Company engaged SYB Group, LLC (“SYB”) to serve as the Qualified Person (“QP”) to update estimates of the Company’s limestone mineral resources and reserves, as of December 31, 2023, at its quarries and mines at Texas Lime, Batesville, Love Hollow, and St. Clair (collectively, the “Material Properties”) and provide Technical Report Summaries (“TRSs”) to file as Exhibits 96.1-96.4 to its Report on its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The QP was not retained to prepare estimates at Carthage, Mill Creek, or Colorado because the Company had not completed a drilling program sufficient to enable the QP to prepare estimates of the limestone mineral resources and reserves at those properties.  
The Company has not conducted a drilling program on any of the Material Properties subsequent to the December 31, 2023 effective date of the 2023 TRSs.  In the 2023 TRSs, limestone resources and reserves were calculated using a $12.70 per ton price assumption for crushed limestone based on the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summaries 2023.  The U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024 increased the price to $14.15 per ton, but the QP has determined that this change in price did not have a material impact on the calculation of the reserves and resources and that all material assumptions and information from the TRSs for Material Properties as of December 31, 2023 remain current as of December 31, 2024.  The Company has not asked the QP to produce updated TRSs as of December 31, 2024, and it has continued to present limestone and mineral resources and reserves for all Material Properties using the 2023 $12.70 per ton price assumption for crushed limestone.
Summaries of the Company’s total limestone mineral resources and reserves for all Material Properties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown below.  The terms Mineral Resource, Measured Resources, Indicated Resources, Mineral Reserves, Proven Reserves, and Probable Reserves are defined in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K subpart 229.1300 governing disclosures by registrants engaged in mining operations.  Limestone mineral resources are presented exclusive of limestone mineral reserves.

Carthage operates the Carthage Mine and has crushed limestone production facilities located on approximately 800 acres that it owns containing high-quality limestone. In addition, Carthage has the right to mine the high-quality limestone contained in approximately 760 adjacent acres pursuant to long-term mineral leases. 
Mill Creek operates the Mill Creek Quarry and production facilities located on approximately 570 acres that it owns where it mines and processes crushed dolomitic limestone.
Colorado Lime acquired the Monarch Pass Quarry in November 1995 and has not carried out any mining on the property. The Monarch Pass Quarry, which had been operated for many years until the early 1990s, contains a mixture of limestone types, including high-quality calcium limestone. 
Internal Controls Over Limestone Mineral Resources and Reserves Estimates.  
Internal control procedures followed by the Company’s Quality Control/Quality Assurance Laboratories (“QC/QA Lab”) and its contract geologists when assessing properties for limestone mineral resources and reserves estimates are clearly defined.  When undertaken, core drilling is conducted under the direct supervision of the geologists, and all core data is logged using a standard protocol.  The geologists are responsible for examining the core and compiling an interval list for X-Ray Florescence (“XRF”) analysis.  Splits of cores are bagged and labeled with the depth interval to be analyzed, with the remaining split boxed and stored for reference.  Bagged intervals are submitted to the Company’s certified QC/QA Lab for XRF analysis, with any samples not destroyed by the testing process retained at the Company’s core storage facility.  On an ongoing basis, the QC/QA Lab analyzes production samples for cutoff grade consistency with expectations used in the estimates for limestone mineral resources and reserves.
When classifying limestone mineral resources and reserves, the Company’s contract geologists apply a fixed cutoff grade and set parameters of geologic confidence to classify the respective resources and reserves.  Company management reviews the geologists’ assessments for reasonableness.
Quarrying and Mining.
  The Company extracts limestone by the open-pit method at its Texas, Batesville, Love Hollow, and Mill Creek Quarries. The Monarch Pass Quarry is also an open-pit quarry but is not being mined at this time. The open-pit method consists of removing any overburden comprising soil and other substances, including inferior limestone, and then extracting the exposed high-quality limestone. The Company removes such overburden by utilizing both its own employees and equipment and those of outside contractors. Open-pit mining is generally less expensive than underground mining. The principal disadvantage of the open-pit method is that operations are subject to inclement weather and overburden removal. The limestone is extracted by drilling and blasting, utilizing standard mining equipment. At the St. 
Clair and Carthage mines, the Company mines limestone underground using room and pillar mining.  The Company has no knowledge of any recent changes in the physical quarrying or mining conditions on any of our properties that have materially affected quarrying or mining operations.
Plants and Facilities.
  After extraction, the limestone is further crushed and screened to produce crushed limestone, and, in the case of PLS, ground and dried, or, in the case of quicklime, processed in kilns. Quicklime may then be further processed in hydrators and slakers to produce hydrated lime and lime slurry. The Company produces and distributes crushed limestone, PLS, and quicklime products at five plants, six lime slurry facilities, and three terminal facilities. All of its plants and facilities are accessible by paved roads, and, in the case of the Arkansas Lime, St. Clair and Carthage plants, the Love Hollow Quarry, and the terminal facilities, also by rail.

Table of Contents
In addition to the Company’s production of crushed limestone at each of its plants, the following Company plants produce additional lime and limestone products:
The Texas Lime plant has an annual capacity of approximately 470 thousand tons of quicklime from two preheater rotary kilns. The plant also has PLS equipment, which, depending on the product mix, has the capacity to produce approximately 800 
thousand tons of PLS annually.  In 2024, we received the necessary permit to construct a new vertical kiln at the Texas Lime plant.  We estimate that the construction costs of the new kiln and related equipment and infrastructure will total approximately $65 million.  Through December 2024, we have incurred $1.6 million and have outstanding purchase obligations of $31.7 million.
The Arkansas Lime plant is situated at the Batesville Quarry. Utilizing three preheater rotary kilns, this plant has an annual capacity of approximately 650 
thousand tons of quicklime. The Arkansas Lime plant is approximately 21 miles from the Love Hollow Quarry, to which it is connected by railroad.  Arkansas Lime’s PLS and hydrating facilities are situated on a tract of 290 acres located approximately two miles from the Batesville Quarry, to which it is connected by a Company-owned railroad. The PLS equipment, depending on the product mix, has the capacity to produce approximately 300 
thousand tons of PLS annually.  
The St. Clair plant has an annual capacity of approximately 250 thousand tons of quicklime from one vertical kiln and one preheater rotary kiln. The plant also has PLS equipment, which has the capacity to produce approximately 150 thousand tons of PLS annually. 
The Carthage plant has facilities located next to the Carthage Mine that produce both crushed limestone and PLS.  The equipment has the capacity to produce approximately 900 thousand tons annually.
The Mill Creek plant has facilities located next to the Mill Creek Quarry that produce dolomitic PLS products.  The equipment has the capacity to produce approximately 300 thousand tons annually.
The Company also maintains lime hydrating and bagging equipment at the Texas, Arkansas, and St. Clair plants. Storage facilities for lime and limestone products at each plant consist primarily of cylindrical tanks, which are considered by the Company to be adequate to protect its lime and limestone products and to provide an available supply for customers’ needs at the expected volumes of shipments. Equipment is maintained at each plant to load trucks and, at the Arkansas Lime, St. Clair, and Mill Creek plants, to load railroad cars.
Colorado Lime operates a limestone grinding and bagging facility with an annual capacity of approximately 125 thousand tons, located on approximately three and one-half acres of land in Delta, Colorado.
During 2024, the Company’s utilization rate was approximately 69% of its total annual production capacity for its lime and limestone.
U.S. Lime Company uses quicklime to produce lime slurry, and has four Houston area facilities, including two distribution terminals connected to railroads, to serve the Greater Houston area construction market and four facilities to serve the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. The Company established U.S. Lime Company-Transportation to deliver some of the Company’s products to its customers and facilities primarily in Texas.
U.S. Lime Company-Shreveport operates a distribution terminal in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is connected to a railroad, to provide lime storage, hydrating, slurrying, and distribution capacity to service markets in Louisiana and East Texas.
The Company believes that its plants and facilities are adequately maintained and insured.
Human Capital Resources.
  The Company is committed to attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent to meet the current and future needs of its business.  Attracting, retaining, motivating, and investing in the development of human capital resources is a critical part of the Company’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) and sustainability issues.

At December 
31, 2024, the Company employed 345 persons, 114 of whom were represented by unions.  The Company is a party to three collective bargaining agreements.  The collective bargaining agreement for the Carthage facilities expires in May 2025.  The collective bargaining agreement for the Texas facilities expires in November 2026.    The collective bargaining agreement for the Arkansas facilities expires in January 2029.  Overall, the Company believes that its employee relations are generally good.
Employee Retention and Incentivization.  
The Company has entered into a new employment agreement with Timothy W. Byrne, its President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).  Mr. Byrne’s employment agreement has been extended until December 31, 2028 and will continue thereafter for successive one-year periods unless the Company or Mr. Byrne gives at least one year’s prior written notice of intent not to renew.  Under the employment agreement, in addition to the possibility of a discretionary cash bonus, Mr. Byrne is entitled each year to an EBITDA cash bonus opportunity under the United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (the “Plan”), and he is also entitled to grants of restricted stock under the Plan.
Mr. Byrne’s employment agreement provides that Mr. Byrne is subject to certain compensation recovery and share ownership provisions designed to align Mr. Byrne’s financial interests with those of the Company’s long-term shareholders, and to ensure that he is incentivized not to take actions that may benefit the Company and its shareholders in the short-term at the expense of long-term corporate value creation and sustainability.  In particular, in entering into the employment agreement with Mr. Byrne, the Company’s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee were sensitive to how Mr. Byrne’s leadership and actions could further the Company’s various objectives, including human capital resources development and executive succession planning.
With respect to the Company’s broader employee base, certain employees are eligible to receive annual cash bonuses based on discretionary determinations.  Except in the case of Mr. Byrne, the Company has not adopted a formal or informal annual bonus arrangement with pre-set performance goals.  Rather, the determination to pay a cash bonus, if any, is made in December each year based on the past performance of the individual and the Company or on the attainment of non-quantified performance goals during the year.  In either such case, the discretionary bonus may be based on the specific accomplishments of the individual and/or on the overall performance of the Company.  The amounts of the discretionary bonuses for 2024 were based on each employee’s individual performance and accomplishments, as well as those of the Company, including productivity, sales, controlling costs, and contributions made to special projects.
In addition to cash bonuses, the Company makes equity awards to certain individuals under the Plan.  The Company uses equity awards granted under the Plan as a means to attract, retain, and motivate the Company’s directors, officers, employees, and consultants.  The Company views the use of equity awards under the Plan as an important means of aligning the interests of its employees with those of its shareholders.
Employee Health and Safety
.  The Company believes that it is responsible to its employees to provide a safe and healthy workplace environment. The Company seeks to accomplish this by: training employees in safe work practices; openly communicating with employees; following safety standards and establishing and improving safe work practices; involving employees in safety processes; and recording, reporting, and investigating accidents, incidents, and losses to avoid reoccurrence. 
Employee Development and Training
.  The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its employees.  It advances continual learning and career development through ongoing performance and development conversations or evaluations with employees and internally and externally developed training programs.  The Company also provides reimbursement for certain educational programs relating to the Company’s business.
Employee Diversity and Inclusion
.  The Company is committed to fostering a work environment that values and promotes diversity and inclusion.  This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services, without regard to a person’s gender, nationality, race, and ethnicity.  The Company is focused on the development and fair treatment of its employees, including equal employment hiring practices and policies, anti-harassment, and anti-retaliation policies.  The Company is continuing to invest in efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce and workplace environment.

Competition.
  The lime industry is highly regionalized and competitive, with price, quality, ability to meet customer demands and specifications, proximity to customers, personal relationships, and timeliness of deliveries being the prime competitive factors. The Company’s competitors are predominantly private companies.
The lime industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, including: the scarcity of high-quality limestone deposits on which the required zoning and permitting for extraction can be obtained; the need for lime plants and facilities to be located close to markets, paved roads, and railroad networks to enable cost-effective production and distribution; clean air and anti-pollution regulations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions, which make it more difficult to obtain permitting for new sources of emissions, such as lime kilns; and the high capital cost of the plants and facilities. These considerations reinforce the premium value of operations having permitted, long-term, high-quality limestone resources and good locations and transportation relative to markets.
Lime producers tend to be concentrated on known high-
quality limestone formations where competition takes place principally on a regional basis.  While the steel industry and environmental-
related users are the largest market sectors, the lime industry also counts chemical users and other industrial users, including paper manufacturers, oil and gas services and highway, road and building contractors, among its major customers.  
In recent years, the lime industry has experienced reduced demand from certain industries as they have experienced cyclical or secular downturns.  For example, demand from the Company’s steel and oil and gas services customers has tended to vary with the demand for their products and services, which has continued to be cyclical.  
In addition, utility plants have been using more natural gas and renewable sources for power generation instead of coal, with the permitting of new coal-fired utility plants having become extremely difficult, which has reduced their demand for lime and limestone for flue gas treatment processes.
  These reductions in demand have resulted in increased competitive pressures, including pricing and competition for certain customer accounts, in the industry.  
Consolidation in the lime industry has left the three largest companies accounting for more than two-
thirds of North American production capacity.  In addition to the consolidations, and often in conjunction with them, many lime producers have undergone modernization and expansion and development projects to upgrade their processing equipment in an effort to improve operating efficiency.  The Company believes that its modernization and expansion projects in Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma and its recent acquisitions, along with its lime slurry operations in Texas, should allow it to continue to remain competitive, protect its markets and position itself for the future.  In addition, the Company will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities for expansion, growth and increased profitability, as conditions warrant, or opportunities arise.  The Company may have to revise its strategy or otherwise consider ways to enhance the value of the Company, including by entering into strategic partnerships, mergers or other transactions.
Compliance with Government Regulations.  
The Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.  These include laws and regulations relating to the environment, zoning and land use, mine permitting and operations, mine safety, and reclamation and remediation.  
​
Environmental Laws.
  The Company owns or controls large areas of land on which it operates limestone quarries, two underground mines, lime plants, and other facilities with inherent environmental responsibilities, compliance costs, and liabilities.  These include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control equipment, the cost of ongoing monitoring and reporting programs, the cost of reclamation efforts, and other similar environmental costs and liabilities.
​
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulatory matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and analogous state and local laws, including state mining and reclamation statutes and regulations (“Environmental Laws”).  These Environmental Laws grant the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), state governmental agencies, and local governments the authority to promulgate and enforce regulations that could result in substantial expenditures on pollution control, waste management, permitting compliance activities, and mining reclamation.  Many Environmental Laws also authorize private citizens and interest groups to file lawsuits in court to enforce alleged violations.  Changes in policy or political 
13

Table of Contents
leadership may affect how Environmental Laws are interpreted or enforced by the EPA and state governmental agencies.  The failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in administrative and civil penalties, injunctive relief, and criminal prosecution.  The Company has not been named as a potentially responsible party in any federal superfund cleanup site or state-led cleanup site.
The rate of change of Environmental Laws continues to be rapid, and compliance can require significant expenditures.  Permits and other authorizations under Environmental Laws are required for the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification during the permit renewal process and, in very rare instances, could be revoked. 
The Clean Air Act and analogous state laws require the Company to obtain authorization to construct or modify existing facilities, and its lime plants are subject to operating permits that have significant ongoing compliance costs.  
Over time, the EPA has increased the stringency of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”), which are used to establish air emission permitting limits under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA has lowered ozone standards and reclassified areas where State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) exist.  In 2015, the EPA issued a rule establishing the ground-level ozone NAAQS at 70 parts per billion.  In 2024, the EPA redesignated the Dallas-Fort Worth nonattainment area, which includes the Texas Lime facility, as a severe nonattainment area under the 2008 ozone standard and a serious nonattainment area under the 2015 ozone standard.  The EPA has set attainment dates of August 2027 for the 2008 ozone standard and July 2027 for the 2015 ozone standard.  Texas is in the process of developing regulations in response to the redesignations to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which will likely involve more stringent permitting requirements for stationary sources.
In February 2024, the EPA issued a final rule reducing the NAAQS for fine particulate matter.  This regulation will significantly increase nonattainment areas across the United States, potentially including areas where the Company operates.  States with delegated permitting authority under the Clean Air Act will be required to revise their SIPs accordingly, which may involve more stringent permitting requirements. 
In July 2024, under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”) for lime plants, which revise the standards required to meet the maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) at major sources of hazardous air pollutants within the lime industry.  The revised MACT rule establishes stringent emission limitations for additional hazardous air pollutants which require additional pollution control equipment at lime kilns subject to the rule.
EPA regulations require large emitters of greenhouse gases, including the Company’s plants, to collect and report greenhouse gas emissions data.  The EPA has previously indicated that it will use the data collected through the greenhouse gas reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits.  The EPA and delegated states also regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs for facilities that are otherwise subject to permitting based on their emissions of conventional, non-greenhouse gas pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
​
Although the timing and impact of climate change legislation and of regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions are uncertain, the consequences of such legislation and regulation are potentially significant for the Company because the production of CO
2
 is inherent in the manufacture of lime through the calcination of limestone and combustion of fossil fuels.  Future greenhouse gas rulemakings could affect New Source Review permitting or other permitting programs and, thereby, increase the time and costs of plant upgrades and expansions.  The passage of climate change legislation, and other regulatory initiatives by the Congress, the states, or the EPA that restrict or tax emissions of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company.  There is no assurance that changes in the law or regulations will not be adopted, such as the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limits, a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program requiring the Company to purchase carbon credits, or other measures that would require reductions in emissions or changes to raw materials, fuel use, or production rates.  Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.
14

Table of Contents
These and similar rulemakings could increase the cost of future plant modifications or expansions, may make it difficult or impossible to obtain new authorizations and permits for new facilities, may require the Company to purchase emissions offsets as a condition of new authorizations and permits, and may increase compliance costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.
In addition to regulation, court cases have been filed and decisions issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by third parties against companies for their greenhouse gas emissions.  Such cases may seek to challenge air permits, to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or to recover damages for alleged climate change impacts.
The Company also holds permits for process water and storm water discharges and must comply with the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.  Any failure to comply with these permits could result in fines or other penalties.  Material changes to the terms of these permits or changes to regulations affecting water discharges in the future could also increase compliance costs.  
​
The manufacturing of quicklime and hydrated lime requires significant volumes of water.  The Company operates multiple groundwater wells to provide water to its plants.  Groundwater pumping is subject to increased regulation, and in some areas the Company is required to obtain permits from groundwater conservation districts to pump groundwater.  Any failure to comply with these permits could result in fines or other penalties, and future changes that restrict the quantities of groundwater that may be pumped may limit production and increase compliance costs.
​
The Company incurred capital expenditures related to environmental matters of $1.0 million, $1.5 million, and $0.8 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company’s recurring costs associated with managing environmental permitting and waste recycling and disposal (e.g., used oil and lubricants) and maintaining pollution control equipment amounted to $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $0.4 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Mine Safety
.

The Company’s mining operations are also subject to regulation under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”).  The Mine Act has been construed as authorizing the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault.  If, in the opinion of an MSHA inspector, a condition that violates the Mine Act or regulations promulgated pursuant to it exists, then a citation or order will be issued regardless of whether the operator had any knowledge of, or fault in, the existence of that condition.  Many of the Mine Act standards include one or more subjective elements, so that issuance of a citation or order often depends on the opinions or experience of the MSHA inspector involved and the frequency and severity of citations and orders will vary from inspector to inspector.
Whenever MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation or order which describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation.  In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order requiring cessation of operations, or removal of miners from the area of the mine, affected by the condition until the hazards are corrected.  Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it has authority to propose a civil penalty or fine, as a result of the violation, that the operator is ordered to pay.
Citations and orders can be contested before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the “Commission”), and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes vacated.  The Commission is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act.  These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders, and penalties that they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act.
For further information, see Exhibit 95.1 to this Report on Form 10-K.
Reclamation and Remediation.

The Company recognizes legal reclamation and remediation obligations associated with the retirement of long-
lived assets at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred (“Asset Retirement Obligations” or “AROs”).  Some of the states the Company operates in have reclamation regulations to properly reclaim surface mines.  These regulations require permitting with the respective state to ensure reclamation obligations are met.  Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion 
15

Table of Contents
expense, and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the ARO for its recorded amount or recognizes a gain or loss. AROs are estimated based on studies and the Company’s process knowledge and estimates and are discounted using an appropriate interest rate. The AROs are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. The Company believes its accrual of $1.5 million for AROs at December 31, 2024 is reasonable.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTOR
S.
Industry Risks
Our operations are affected by general economic conditions in the United States and specific economic conditions in particular industries
.
General and industry specific economic conditions in the United States could lead to reduced demand for our lime and limestone products.  Specifically, demand from our utility customers has decreased due to the continuing trend in the United States to retire coal-fired utility plants.  Our construction, steel, and oil and gas services customers reduce their purchase volumes, at times, due to cyclical economic conditions in their industries.  Any overall reduction in demand for lime and limestone products could result in increased competitive pressures, including pricing pressure and competition for certain customer accounts, from other lime producers.
For us to maintain or increase our profitability, we must maintain or increase our revenues and improve cash flows, manage our capital expenditures, and control our operational and selling, general and administrative expenses. If we are unable to maintain our revenues and control our costs in these uncertain economic and regulatory times, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.
Our mining and other operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production and shipment levels that could materially adversely affect our operations and their profitability.
We mine limestone in open-pit and underground mining operations and process and distribute that limestone through our plants and other facilities. Certain factors beyond our control could disrupt our operations, adversely affect production and shipments, and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  These include geological formation problems that may cause poor mining conditions, variability of chemical or physical properties of our limestone, an accident or other major incident at a site that may cause all or part of our operations to cease for some period of time and increase our expenses, mining, processing, and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems that may cause disruptions and added expenses, strikes, job actions, or other work stoppages that may disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers, contractors, or customers and increase our expenses, and adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, excessive rains, flooding, ice storms, freezing weather, drought, wild fires, earthquakes, and other natural events, that may affect operations, transportation, fuel supply, or our suppliers, contractors, or customers.
If any of these conditions or events occurs, our operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments, our operating costs could increase significantly, and we could be exposed to fines, penalties, assessments, and other liabilities. If our insurance coverage is limited or excludes a given condition or event, we may not be able to recover in full the losses that we may incur as a result of such conditions or events, some of which may be substantial.

Table of Contents
The lime and limestone industry is highly regionalized and competitive.
Our competitors are predominately large private companies. The primary competitive factors in the lime industry are price, quality, ability to meet customer demands and specifications, proximity to customers, personal relationships, and timeliness of deliveries, with varying emphasis on these factors depending upon the specific product application. To the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, we may find it difficult to increase or maintain our prices or to retain certain customer accounts, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.
Business and Financial Risks
In the normal course of our operations, we face various business and financial risks, including increased energy, labor, and parts and supplies costs, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. Not all risks are foreseeable or within our ability to control.
These risks arise from various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuating demand and prices for our lime and limestone products, including as a result of downturns in the economy and in the construction, industrial, steel, and oil and gas services industries, and reduced demand from coal-fired utility plants, increased competitive pressures from other lime producers, changes in inflationary expectations, changes in legislation and regulations, including Environmental Laws, health and safety regulations, and requirements to renew or obtain operating permits, our ability to produce and store quantities of lime and limestone products sufficient in amount and quality to meet customer demands and specifications, the success of our modernization, expansion and development, and acquisition strategies, the uncertainty of our ability to sell any increased production capacity at acceptable prices, our ability to execute our strategies and complete projects on time and within budget, our ability to integrate, refurbish, and/or improve acquired facilities, our access to capital, volatile costs, especially energy costs, inclement weather and the effects of seasonal trends.
We receive most of our coal and petroleum coke by rail, so the availability of sufficient solid fuels to run our plants could be diminished significantly in the event of major rail disruptions. Domestic coal and petroleum coke may also be exported, which can increase competition and prices for the domestic supply. In addition, our freight costs to deliver our lime and limestone products are high relative to the value of our products, and they have generally increased in recent years. Our costs for delivery of solid fuels, as well as our products, also increase as demand for rail and trucking by other industries increases, and changes to Department of Transportation rules and regulations can reduce the availability of trucks, truck drivers, and rail cars to deliver solid fuels to our plants and deliver our products to our customers. Recent events, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the sanctions and other actions resulting therefrom, could further increase our energy costs.  If we are unable to continue to pass along our increasing energy, labor, and parts and supplies costs to customers through higher prices or surcharges, or unable to timely receive contracted supplies of solid fuel to run our plants, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.
We quote our lime and limestone products on a delivered price basis to certain customers, which requires us to estimate future delivery costs. Our actual delivery costs may exceed these estimates, which would reduce our profitability.
Delivery costs are impacted by the price of diesel. When diesel prices increase, we incur additional fuel surcharges from freight companies that cannot be passed on to our customers that have been quoted a delivered price. Material increases in the price of diesel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability.
To maintain our competitive position in the lime and limestone industry, we may need to continue to increase the efficiency of our operations, expand production capacity, and sell any resulting increased production at acceptable prices.
We have undertaken a new kiln project at Texas Lime.  We may in the future undertake additional modernization and expansion and development projects and acquisitions.  Given current and projected demand for lime 
18

Table of Contents
and limestone products, we cannot guarantee that any such project or acquisition would be successful, that we would be able to sell any resulting increased production at acceptable prices, or that any such sales would be profitable.  We are unable to predict future demand and prices, given the current economic and regulatory uncertainties in the United States economy as a whole and in particular industries, and cannot provide any assurance that current levels of demand and prices will continue or that any future increases in demand or prices can be maintained.
We may be limited in our ability to insure against certain risk of our operations.
Mining limestone and producing lime and limestone products involve risks which could result in damage to our facilities, personal injury, and environmental damage.  Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.  Additionally, the risks inherent in mining limestone and the production of lime and limestone products may significantly increase the cost of obtaining adequate insurance coverage, or make some coverage unavailable.
We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems, including due to cybersecurity risks and incidents.
We rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology (“IT”) systems for our mining, manufacturing, sales, financial, and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our IT systems and implementing upgrades when necessary, including the prompt detection and remediation of any cybersecurity risks or incidents. 
Our cybersecurity processes are focused on the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-
attack, and other cybersecurity risks and threats.  However, our cybersecurity processes may not be successful in preventing unauthorized access, intrusion, disclosure, and damage.  Risks and threats to our systems can derive from human error, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties, ransomware, or technological failure.  Any failure, threat, or incident involving our IT systems could adversely impact our mining and manufacturing operations, sales or financial and administrative functions, or result in the compromise of personal or other confidential information of our employees, customers, or suppliers. Similarly, any failure, threat, or incident involving the IT systems of our suppliers, contractors, or customers could adversely impact our operations and financial results.
To the extent any such cybersecurity failure, threat, or incident results in disruption to our operations or sales or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our costs could increase, and our reputation, business, results of operations, competitive position, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, should we experience a cybersecurity incident, we may incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, legal expenses, and losses and costs associated with regulatory actions.
Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position could be materially adversely impacted by pandemics, epidemics, or disease outbreaks.  

Disruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics, or disease outbreaks could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. New or future variants of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus, bird flu, or other pandemics, epidemics, or disease outbreaks and governmental responses to such events could similarly disrupt our business and operations.  A pandemic, epidemic, or disease outbreak may limit our ability to produce, sell, and deliver our lime and limestone products to our customers; cause key management and plant-level employees not to be available to us; result in mine and plant shutdowns due to contagion, in which case we may not be able to shift production to our other mines and plants; cause delays and disruptions to our supply chain as it relates to our suppliers, as well as delay and disrupt the supply chains of our customers; impede our ability to maintain and repair our plants and equipment; negatively impact our modernization, expansion, and development plans; negatively impact our ability to integrate acquisitions; as well as adversely impact demand and prices for our lime and limestone products and increase our costs.

Governmental, Legal, and Regulatory Risks 
Our operations are subject to general and industry specific regulations.  Changes to the regulatory environment could increase our cost of compliance and adversely impact our financial condition, 
r
esults of operations, cash flows, and competitive position
.
We are in a period of economic and regulatory uncertainty, which has been heightened by the current divides and changes in the branches of the United States federal government. The Administration and Congress may initiate actions to increase regulation of certain industries, including the lime industry, and may take other steps to restrict oil and gas drilling, reduce the use of coal, or regulate domestic manufacturing.  There can be no assurance that any of these actions, if adopted, will not increase costs for our customers or increase our cost of compliance with zoning and land use, mine permitting and operating, mine safety, reclamation and remediation, and environmental laws.  In addition, the new Administration has communicated a desire to use tariffs as a means of policy implementation which could have an impact on the cost and availability of some of our supplies and those of our customers.  A variety of factors, including uncertainty with respect to governmental fiscal and budgetary constraints, including the timing and amount of construction and infrastructure spending, changes to tax laws, legislative impasses, extended government shutdowns, fallout from downgrades and potential U.S. government defaults on its obligations, pandemics, trade wars, tariffs, social unrest, international incidents, and increased inflationary pressures and interest rates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.
We incur environmental compliance costs and liabilities in our operations, including capital, maintenance, and operating costs, with respect to pollution control equipment, the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of reclamation and remediation efforts, and other similar costs and liabilities relating to our compliance with Environmental Laws.  We expect these costs and liabilities to continue or increase, such as possible new costs, taxes, and limitations on operations, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.  Similar environmental costs and liabilities may also be faced by some of our customers.
The rate of change of Environmental Laws has been rapid over the last decade, and we may face possible new uncertainties, costs and liabilities, taxes, and limitations on operations, including those related to climate change initiatives.  Changes in policy or political leadership may affect how Environmental Laws are interpreted or enforced by the EPA and state governmental agencies.  We expect our expenditure requirements for future environmental compliance, including complying with nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter emission under the NAAQS and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, to continue or increase.  Discovery of currently unknown conditions and unforeseen costs and liabilities could require additional expenditures.  
​
The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions remains an issue for us and some of our customers. There is no assurance that changes in the law or regulations will not be adopted, such as the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limits, a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program requiring companies to purchase carbon credits, or other measures that would require reductions in emissions or changes to raw materials, fuel use, or production rates.  These changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.  
​
More stringent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect the competitiveness of some of our customers, including coal-fired power plants, and indirectly the demand for our lime and limestone products.  For example, our utility customers are continuing to switch from coal to natural gas or renewable sources for power generation for environmental and regulatory as well as cost reasons, thus reducing demand for our lime and limestone products for flue gas treatment processes.
​
We intend to comply with all Environmental Laws and believe our accrual for environmental costs and liabilities at December 31, 2024 is reasonable.  Because many of the requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable or presently determinable, or may be affected by additional legislation and rulemaking, including those related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure new permits in connection with our future modernization and expansion and development projects, and it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs and liabilities relating to environmental compliance and their effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.

We also have legal reclamation and remediation obligations associated with the retirement of AROs.  Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion expense, and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset.  Upon settlement of the liability, we either settle the ARO for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss.  We believe our accrual for AROs is reasonable, but there can be no assurance that any amounts accrued will be sufficient to meet our reclamation and remediation obligations at any point in time.
We intend to comply with all mining regulations and all of our reclamation and remediation obligations.  If we fail to comply with such regulations and obligations, such noncompliance may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position.

Risk Management and Strategy.  
We have designed and implemented 
processes
 to assess, identify, manage, detect, and respond to material cybersecurity risks and threats to our IT systems, including the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our IT systems and the information residing on those systems.  These processes are part of our overall risk management process and are embedded in our operating policies, procedures, and controls.

To protect our IT systems and information from cybersecurity risks, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve, and recover from identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents in a timely manner.  These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring, and detection tools. We also utilize a third-party security operations center connected to a networks operation center to identify, investigate, and resolve any cybersecurity threats and incidents.
​
We regularly assess technological risks to our IT systems and information and monitor our IT systems for potential vulnerabilities and risks. We frequently conduct mandatory cybersecurity and IT systems awareness training for all employees with access to our systems.  We also conduct regular reviews and tests of our IT cybersecurity processes, including reviews, assessments, and exercises.
​
We aim to incorporate responsible practices throughout our cybersecurity risk management processes.  Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls, technologies, and other processes to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks to our IT systems and information.  As a part of this process, 
we engage independent third-party specialists to review our cybersecurity environment
, including formal reviews and assessments, and we request specific, actionable

General.
We have identified one reportable business segment, lime and limestone operations, based on the distinctness of our activities and products. All operations are in the United States. During 2024, we determined that the activities of our natural gas interests did not meet the requirements of an operating segment. Previously unallocated items, including cash, interest income and expense, and other expense are now included as part of our single lime and limestone operations segment. Disclosures for 2023 and 2022 have been recast to be consistent with the 2024 presentation.
Our revenues increased 12.9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products of 14.2%, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in sales volume. This decrease in demand was primarily from our construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our industrial, environmental, and roof shingle customers. Our gross profit increased 40.0% in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the increased revenues discussed above.
Our other (income) expense, net was $11.5 million income in 2024, compared to $7.9 million income in 2023, an increase of $3.5 million.  The increase in other income, net in 2024, compared to 2023, was due to interest earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our net income increased $34.3 
million, or 46.0%, in 2024, compared to 2023.  Net income per fully diluted share increased to $3.79 in 2024, compared to $2.61 in 2023, an increase of 45.2%.
Cash flows from operations enabled us to make $27.4 million of capital investments in 2024.  It also enabled us to pay $5.7 million in dividends in 2024 and increase our cash balances to $278.0 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $188.0 million as of December 31, 2023.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no debt outstanding.
On May 2, 2024, our shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 30,000,000 to 45,000,000. On July 12, 2024, we effected a 5-for-1 split of our common stock, in the form of a stock dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each share outstanding, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2024 (the “Stock Split”). All share and per share information, including stock-based 
26

Table of Contents
compensation, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.10 per share.
On February 3, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared an increased regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share.  The dividend is payable on March 14, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2025.
Absent a significant acquisition opportunity arising during 2025, we anticipate funding our operating and capital needs and our regular cash dividends from our cash balances on hand and cash flows from operations.
Our Operations.
We produce and sell crushed limestone, PLS, aggregate, quicklime, hydrated lime and lime slurry. The principal factors affecting our success are the level of demand and prices for our products and whether we are able to maintain sufficient production levels and product quality while controlling costs.
Adverse weather conditions, such as ice storms, freezing weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, excessive rains, and flooding, generally reduce the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction-related customers that account for a significant amount of our revenues. Inclement weather also interferes with our open-pit mining operations and can disrupt our plant production. In addition to weather, various maintenance, environmental, accident, and other operational and construction issues can also disrupt our operations and increase our operating expenses.
Demand for our lime and limestone products in our market areas is also affected by general economic conditions, the pace of construction, including the level of governmental and private funding for highway construction and infrastructure, utility plant usage of coal for power generation, the demand for steel, and the level of oil and gas drilling in our markets. 
Texas continues to invest heavily in its transportation, including directing certain sales and use tax revenues, state motor vehicle sales and rental tax revenues, and oil and gas tax revenues to the State Highway Fund, as required under the Texas constitution.  In its fiscal 2024, Texas transferred approximately $6.2 billion of such tax revenues to the State Highway Fund. Additionally, for future roadway projects outlined in the Texas Department of Transportation’s 2024 Unified Transportation Program, the state programmed a $15.5 billion increase in funding for a total of $100.6 billion in construction and major maintenance projects planned over the next 10 years.  In 2021, the United States Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is estimated to apportion approximately $27.5 billion to Texas for federal-aid highway programs, of which $16.6 billion has been announced for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects.  With these funding sources, we would expect to see strong continued demand from our construction customers, but the timing and amount of any increase in demand is uncertain and subject to weather, political, economic, and other factors. 
Our modernization and expansion and development projects and acquisitions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri and our Texas slurry operations have positioned us to meet the demand for high-
quality lime and limestone products in our markets.  Our modernization and expansion and development projects have also equipped us with up-to-date, fuel-
efficient plant facilities, which have resulted in lower production costs and greater operating efficiencies, thus enhancing our competitive position.  All of our rotary kilns are now fuel-efficient preheater kilns, and the addition of the vertical kiln at St. 
Clair further increased the fuel efficiency of our fleet of kilns.  Future projects, such as our new kiln project at Texas Lime, will create the opportunity for further fuel efficiency.
For our plants to operate at peak efficiency, we must meet operational challenges that arise from time to time, including bringing new facilities on-line and refurbishing and/or improving acquired facilities, including the facilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of Carthage and Mill Creek, as well as operating existing facilities efficiently. We also incur ongoing costs for maintenance and to remain in compliance with rapidly changing Environmental Laws and health and safety and other regulations.
Our primary variable cost is energy. Prices for coal, petroleum coke, diesel, natural gas, electricity, transportation, and freight are volatile. In addition, our freight costs, including the cost of diesel, to deliver our products can be high relative to the value of our products.
27

Table of Contents
Historically, we have been able to mitigate to some degree the impact of volatile energy costs by varying the mixes of fuel used in our kilns, and by passing on some of any increase in costs to our customers, where possible, through higher prices and/or surcharges on certain products.  In addition, we continually look for other ways to better manage our energy costs at our plants.  Finally, we have not engaged in any significant hedging activity in an effort to control our energy costs but may do so in the future.
We continue to believe that the enhanced efficiency and production capacity resulting from our modernization and expansion and development projects in Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, our expanded slurry operations, our acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Carthage and Mill Creek, and the operational strategies that we have implemented have allowed us to increase our efficiency, grow production capacity, improve product quality, better serve existing customers, attract new customers, and control costs.  However, there can be no assurance that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will enable us to fully utilize any additional production capacity, nor that our production will not be adversely affected by weather, maintenance, regulatory, accident, cybersecurity, and other operational and construction issues; that we can successfully invest in improvements to our existing facilities and acquisitions; that our results will not be adversely affected by increases in fuel, natural gas, electricity, transportation and freight costs, taxes, or new environmental, health and safety, or other regulatory requirements; or that, with increasing competition with other lime and limestone producers, our revenues, gross profit, net income, and cash flows can be maintained or improved.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions and historical trends.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Contingencies.
  We are party to proceedings, lawsuits, and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to regulatory, labor, product, and other matters. We are required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter, including coverage under our insurance policies. This determination may change in the future because of new information or developments.
Income taxes.  
We utilize the asset and liability approach in reporting our income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Income tax related interest and penalties are included in income tax expense.  We also assess individual tax positions to determine if they meet the criteria for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in our financial statements and only recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
Environmental costs and liabilities.
  We record environmental accruals, including accrued reclamation costs, in other liabilities, based on studies and estimates, when it is probable we have incurred a reasonably estimable cost or liability. The accruals are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. Environmental expenditures that extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety or efficiency of Company-owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future possible environmental issues are capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred.

2024 vs. 2023
Our revenues in 2024 increased to $317.7 million from $281.3 
million in 2023, an increase of $36.4 million, or 12.9%. The increase in revenues in 2024 was due to a 14.2% increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to decreased demand from our construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our industrial, environmental, and roof shingle customers.  
Our gross profit increased to $144.0 million in 2024 from $102.9 million in 2023, an increase of $41.1 million, or 40.0%. The increase in gross profit in 2024, compared to 2023, resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased to $19.1 million in 2024, an increase of $1.6 million, or 9.2%, compared to $17.4 million in 2023. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A was 5.9% in 2024, compared to 6.2% in 2023.  The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, in 2024, compared to 2023.
Other (income) expense, net was $11.5 million income in 2024, compared to $7.9 million income in 2023, an increase of $3.5 million. The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2024 compared to 2023, was due to interest earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Income tax expense was $27.5 million in 2024, for an effective rate of 20.2%, compared to $18.8 million in 2023, for an effective rate of 20.2%, an increase of $8.7 million, primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2024, compared to 2023.  Our effective income tax rates in 2024 and 2023 were reduced from the statutory rate primarily due to statutory depletion in excess of basis.
Net income increased to $108.8 million ($3.79 per share diluted) in 2024, compared to $74.5 million ($2.61 per share diluted) in 2023, an increase of $34.3 million, or 46.0%.
2023 vs. 2022
Our revenues in 2023 increased to $281.3 million from $236.2 million in 2022, an increase of $45.2 million, or 19.1%. The increase in revenues in 2023 was due to a 21.1% increase in average selling prices for our lime and limestone products, partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily 
29

Table of Contents
due to decreased demand from our industrial, steel, and construction customers, partially offset by increased demand from our roofing, environmental, and oil and gas services customers.  
Our gross profit increased to $102.9 million in 2023 from $70.3 
million in 2022, an increase of $32.5 million, or 46.2%. The increase in gross profit in 2023, compared to 2022, resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased lime and limestone production costs, principally from higher energy, labor, and parts and supplies costs.  
SG&A increased to $17.4 million in 2023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.1%, compared to $15.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A was 6.2% in 2023, compared to 6.6% in 2022.  The increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased personnel expenses in 2023, compared to 2022.
Other (income) expense, net was $7.9 million income in 2023, compared to $1.8 million income in 2022, an increase of $6.2 million.  The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was due to higher interest rates earned on higher average balances in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Income tax expense was $18.8 million in 2023, for an effective rate of 20.2%, compared to $11.1 million in 2022, for an effective rate of 19.7%, an increase of $7.7 million, primarily due to the increase in income before taxes in 2023, compared to 2022.  Our effective income tax rates in 2023 and 2022 were reduced from the statutory rate primarily due to statutory depletion in excess of basis.
Net income increased to $74.5 million ($2.61 per share diluted) in 2023, compared to $45.4 million ($1.60 per share diluted) in 2022, an increase of $29.1 million, or 64.1%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION.
Capital Requirements.
  We require capital primarily for normal recurring capital and re-
equipping projects, modernization and expansion and development projects, and acquisitions.  Our capital needs are expected to be met principally from cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility.
30

Table of Contents
We expect to spend approximately $22.0 million per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital and re-equipping projects at our plants and facilities to maintain or improve efficiency, ensure compliance with Environmental Laws, meet customer needs, and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $35.5 million in open orders for equipment and construction contracts, including $32.5 million of contractual obligations relating to the new kiln project at Texas Lime.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $126.0 million in 2024, compared to $92.3 million in 2023, an increase of $33.8 million, or 36.6%. Our net cash provided by operating activities is composed of net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”), other non-cash items included in net income, and changes in working capital. In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was principally composed of $108.8 million net income, $24.2 million DD&A, and $4.9 million stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in deferred income taxes and an $11.0 million decrease from changes in working capital. In 2024, the changes in working capital were principally composed of a $5.9 million increase in trade receivables, net, primarily as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter 2024, compared to the fourth quarter 2023, a $3.4 million increase in inventories, primarily due to increases in the costs of our supply of critical parts and the volume of our solid fuel stockpiles, and a $1.0 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. In 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was principally composed of $74.5 million net income, $23.8 million DD&A, and $3.2 million stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in deferred income taxes and an $8.8 million decrease from changes in working capital. In 2023, the changes in working capital were principally composed of a $4.5 million increase in trade receivables, net, primarily as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to the fourth quarter 2022, a $4.7 million increase in inventories, primarily due to increases in the volume of our solid fuel stockpiles and the costs of our supply of critical parts, and a $1.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash used in investing activities was $26.9 million for 2024, compared to $32.0 million for 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for 2024 included $1.4 million on the new kiln and related equipment and infrastructure project at Texas Lime and $1.6 million for real property purchases. Net cash used in investing activities for 2023 included $11.0 million for real property purchases. 
Net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $5.7 million for dividend payments and $3.5 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2024, compared to $4.6 million for dividend payments and $1.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2023.
Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 increased to $278.0 million from $188.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
Banking Facilities and Debt.
  Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”), as amended as of August 3, 2023, provides for a $75 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and an incremental four-year accordion feature to borrow up to an additional $50 million on the same terms, subject to approval by the Lender or another lender selected by us. The credit agreement also provides for a $10 million letter of credit sublimit under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility and any incremental loans mature on August 3, 2028
.
Interest rates on the Revolving Facility are, at our option, SOFR, plus a SOFR adjustment rate of 0.10%, plus a margin of 1.000% to 2.000%, or the Lender’s Prime Rate, plus a margin of 0.000% to 1.000%, and a commitment fee range of 0.225% to 0.350% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility interest rate margins and commitment fee are determined quarterly in accordance with a pricing grid based upon our Cash Flow Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio of our total funded senior indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) for the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, plus pro forma EBITDA from any businesses acquired during the period.  Pursuant to a security agreement, dated August 25, 2004, the Revolving Facility is secured by our existing and hereafter acquired tangible assets, intangible assets, and real property. The maturity of the Revolving Facility and any incremental loans can be accelerated if any event of default, as defined under the credit agreement, occurs.  Our maximum Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is 3.50 to 1.
We may pay dividends so long as we remain in compliance with the provisions of our credit agreement, and we may purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock so long as our pro forma Cash Flow Leverage 
31

Table of Contents
Ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 and no default or event of default exists or would exist after giving effect to such stock repurchase.
At December 31, 2024, we had no debt outstanding and no draws on the Revolving Facility other than $6.6 million of letters of credit, which count as draws against the available commitment under the Revolving Facility.
Common Stock Buybacks.
  We spent $3.5 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, to repurchase treasury shares tendered for payment of the exercise price for stock options and the tax withholding liability upon the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock.

Represents operating leases for railcars, corporate office space, and some equipment that are either non-cancelable or subject to significant penalty upon cancellation.

Of these obligations, $1,657 were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024.
(3)
Purchase obligations includes enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, generally pertaining to fuel contracts, fixed-price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction, and are either non-cancelable or subject to significant penalty upon cancellation, including $32.5 million related to the Texas kiln project.
Absent a significant acquisition, we believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating needs, ongoing capital needs, including our current and possible future modernization and expansion and development projects, such as the Texas kiln project, and liquidity needs and allow us to pay our increased regular cash dividends for the near future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
  We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
 ABOUT MARKET RISK.
INTEREST RATE RISK.
We could be exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of floating interest rates on the Revolving Facility. There was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility subject to interest rate risk at December 31, 2024.  Any future borrowings under the Revolving Facility would be subject to interest rate risk. Additionally, our cash and cash equivalents earn interest which is reported in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. A future decrease in interest rates could reduce the amount of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents.

Opinion on the financial statements 
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (a Texas corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
​
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
​
​
​
Basis for opinion 
​
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion on internal 
control over financial reporting
​
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (a Texas corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
​
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
​
​
​
Basis for opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary 
of
 Significant Accounting Policies
(a)         Organization and Presentation
United States Lime 
& Minerals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a manufacturer of lime and limestone products, supplying primarily the construction (including highway, road, and building contractors), industrial (including paper and glass manufacturers), environmental (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), metals (including steel producers), roof shingle manufacturers, agriculture (including poultry producers),  and oil and gas services industries. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and operates lime and limestone plants and distribution facilities in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Arkansas Lime Company, ART Quarry TRS LLC (DBA Carthage Crushed Limestone), Colorado Lime Company, Mill Creek Dolomite, LLC, Texas Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company-Shreveport, U.S. Lime Company-St. Clair, and U.S. Lime Company-Transportation.  In addition, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Lime Company-O & G, LLC, has royalty and non-operated working interests in natural gas wells located in Johnson County, Texas, in the Barnett Shale Formation.
On May 2, 2024, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the Company’s number of authorized shares of common stock from 
30,000,000
 to 
45,000,000
.  On July 12, 2024, the Company effected a 
5
-for-1 split of its common stock in the form of a stock dividend of 
four
 additional shares of common stock for each share outstanding to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2024 (the “Stock Split”).  All share and per share information, including stock-based compensation, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.  The shares of common stock retain a par value of 
$
0.10
 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the additional shares issued in the Stock Split was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to common stock for all periods presented.
The number and terms of stock-based compensation awards outstanding on the date of the Stock Split were adjusted, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants under the Company’s 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (the “Plan”).  The fair value of all outstanding awards immediately after the Stock Split did not change when compared to the fair value of such awards immediately prior to the Stock Split. In addition, there was no change to the vesting conditions or classification of any of the awards. No incremental compensation expense was recognized as a result of such adjustments.
(b)         Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
(c)         Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.

​
(d)         Statements of Cash Flows
For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid debt instruments, such as United States Treasury bills and notes, with maturities, at the time of purchase, of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair market value. Supplemental cash flow information is presented below:

(e)         Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue for its lime and limestone operations when (i) a contract with the customer exists and the performance obligations are identified; (ii) the price has been established; and (iii) the performance obligations have been satisfied, which is at a point in time, generally upon shipment.  Revenues include external freight billed to customers with related costs accounted for as fulfillment costs and included in cost of revenues.  The Company operates within a single geographic region. The Company’s returns and allowances are minimal.  External freight billed to customers included in revenues was 
$
45,514
, $
46,270
, and $
44,233
 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which approximates the amount of external freight included in cost of revenues. Sales taxes billed to customers are not included in revenues. 
(f)         Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.”  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
(g)         Concentration of Credit Risk and Trade Receivables
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions and in highly rated commercial paper or United States Treasury bills and notes with maturities, at the time of purchase, of three months or less.  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at commercial banking institutions normally exceed federally insured limits.
The majority of the Company’s trade receivables are unsecured. Payment terms for all trade receivables are based on the underlying purchase orders, contracts, or purchase agreements, and are generally fixed, short-term, and do not contain a significant financing component.  The Company estimates credit losses relating to trade receivables based on an assessment of the current and forecasted probability of collection, historical trends, economic conditions, and other significant events that may impact the collectability of trade receivables.  Due to the relatively homogenous nature of its trade receivables, the Company does not believe there is any meaningful asset-specific differences within its accounts receivable portfolio that would require the portfolio to be grouped below the consolidated level for review of credit losses. Credit losses relating to trade receivables have generally been within management expectations and historical trends. Uncollected trade receivables are

charged-off when identified by management to be unrecoverable. Trade receivables are presented net of the related estimated credit losses, which totaled

(i)         Property, Plant and Equipment
For major constructed assets, the capitalized cost includes the price paid by the Company for labor and materials plus interest and internal and external project management costs that are directly related to the constructed assets. Machinery and equipment at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included $
8,098
 and $
6,001
, respectively, of construction in progress for various capital projects. 
No
 interest costs were capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts payable and accrued expenses included $
1,657
 and $
1,196
, respectively, of capitalized costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included depreciation expense of $
318
, $
294
, and $
278
 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is being provided for by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:

​
​
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. When units of property are retired or otherwise disposed of, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income.

​
The Company expenses all exploration costs as incurred, as well as costs incurred at an operating quarry or mine, other than capital expenditures and inventory. Costs to acquire mineral reserves are capitalized upon acquisition. Costs incurred to develop new mineral reserves, to expand the capacity of a quarry or mine, or to develop quarry or mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized once proven and probable reserves exist and can be economically produced. For each quarry or mine, capitalized costs to acquire and develop mineral reserves are depleted using the units-of-production method based on the proven and probable reserves for such quarry or mine.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment and, when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines if impairment of value exists. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment exists, and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded. If an impairment exists, the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value. Any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset. The Company had 
no
 impairments in the years presented in the financial statements.
​
(j)         Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company recognizes legal obligations for reclamation and remediation associated with the retirement of long-
lived assets at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred (“AROs”). Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion expense, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the AROs for the recorded amount or recognizes a gain or loss.  The Company’s AROs of 
$
1,484
 and $
1,548
 as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in Other liabilities and Accrued expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, assets, net of accumulated depreciation, associated with the Company’s AROs totaled 
$
580
.  During 2024 and 2023, the Company spent 
$
94
 and $
36
, respectively, on its AROs, and recognized accretion expense of $
102
, $
99
, and $
97
 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, on its AROs.
The AROs were estimated based on studies and the Company’s process knowledge and estimates and are discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate. The AROs are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. The Company estimates annual expenditures of approximately $
100
 per year in years 2025 through 2029 relating to its AROs.

​
(l)         Environmental Expenditures
Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded at their present value when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals will coincide with completion of a feasibility study or the Company’s commitment to a formal plan of action.
The Company incurred capital expenditures related to environmental matters of $
997
 in 2024, $
1,456
 in 2023, and $

 in 2022.

The Company expenses all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
(o)         Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability approach in its reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances

​
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Income tax related interest and penalties are included in income tax expense.
The Company also assesses individual tax positions to determine if they meet the criteria for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in the Company’s financial statements. The Company only recognizes tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.

Segment Reporting – In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance that expands segment disclosures for public entities, including requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and allocating resources (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 also expands disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets in interim periods and clarifies that a 
public entity may report additional measures of segment profit if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 does not remove existing segment disclosure requirements or change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or determines its reportable segments. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter 2024.  See Note (9) Business Segment. 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures – In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance that expands income tax disclosures for public entities, including requiring enhanced disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual disclosures for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures - In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2024-03 is to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of ASU 2024-03 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Banking Facilities and Debt
The Company’s credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”), as amended as of August 3, 2023, provides for a $
75,000
 revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and an incremental 
four-year
 accordion feature to borrow up to an additional $
50,000
 on the same terms, subject to approval by the Lender or another lender selected by the Company.  The credit agreement also provides for a 
$
10,000
 letter of credit sublimit under the Revolving Facility.  The Revolving Facility and any incremental loans mature on August 3, 2028.
Interest rates on the Revolving Facility are, at the Company’s option, SOFR, plus a SOFR adjustment rate of 
0.10
%, plus a margin of 
1.000
% to 
2.000
%, or the Lender’s Prime Rate, plus a margin of 
0.000
% to 
1.000
%, and a commitment fee range of

Company’s Cash Flow Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio of the Company’s total funded senior indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) for the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, plus pro forma EBITDA from any businesses acquired during the period.  Pursuant to a security agreement, dated August 25, 2004, the Revolving Facility is secured by the Company’s existing and hereafter acquired tangible assets, intangible assets, and real property.  The maturity of the Revolving Facility and any incremental loans can be accelerated if any event of default, as defined under the credit agreement, occurs.  The Company’s maximum Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is 
3.50
 to 1.
The Company may pay dividends so long as it remains in compliance with the provisions of the Company’s credit agreement, and may purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire shares of its common stock so long as its pro forma Cash Flow Leverage Ratio is less than 
3.00
 to 1.00 and no default or event of default exists or would exist after giving effect to such stock repurchase.
The Company had 
no
 debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 or 2023.  The Company had

The Company had 
no
 federal net operating loss carry forwards at December 31, 2024. The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets are considered fully recognizable because of the Company’s recent income history and expectations of income in the future.  The Company’s federal income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent years remain subject to examination.  The Company’s income tax returns in certain state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subsequent years.

There were

 years. The total compensation cost not yet recognized for restricted stock at December 31, 2024 was $
7,190
, which will be recognized over the weighted average of 
1.04
 years.
The fair value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for the 2024, 2023, and 2022 grants: risk-free interest rates of 
4.57
% in 2024, 
3.41
% to 
3.84
% (weighted average 
3.74
%) in 2023, and 
2.92
% to 
3.94
% (weighted average 
3.74
%) in 2022; a dividend yield of 
0.31
% in 2024, 
0.35
% to 
0.48
% (weighted average 
0.39
%) in 2023, and 
0.57
% to 
0.73
% (weighted average 
0.62
%) in 2022; and a volatility factor of 
.406
 in 2024, 
.389
 to 
.400
 (weighted average 
.397
) in 2023, and 
.374
 to 
.385
 (weighted average 
.382
) in 2022, based on the daily per-share closing prices for 
five years
 preceding the date of issuance. In addition, the fair value of these options was estimated based on an expected life of 
five years
. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the closing per-share price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

Share Repurchases
During 2024, pursuant to provisions in the Plan that allow employees and directors to pay the tax withholding liability upon the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock in either cash and/or delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock, the Company repurchased 
28,028

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is party to lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position.
The Company is not contractually committed to any planned capital expenditures until actual orders are placed for equipment or services. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
35,480
 for open equipment and construction contracts.
(9) 
Reportable Segment
In November 2023, the FASB amended guidance in ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting 
(“ASC 280”) by issuing ASU 2023-07, which updated the disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.  The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter 2024, with retrospective application to the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022.  See Note 1(p).
The Company is managed as 
one
 reportable segment, lime and limestone operations, based on the distinctness of the Company’s activities and products.  All operations are in the United States.  During 2024, the Company determined that the activities of its natural gas interests and the associated level of review of those activities by the CODM precluded the natural gas activities from meeting the definition of an operating segment, as provided in ASC 280.  In addition, previously unallocated items, including cash, interest income and expense and other expense are now included as part of lime and limestone operations, and consolidated net income is now used as the measure of segment profit or loss.  Segment disclosures for 2023 and 2022 have been recast to be consistent with the 2024 presentation.
The Company’s CODM is the chief executive officer.  The lime and limestone operations segment derives revenues from the sale of crushed limestone, pulverized limestone, aggregate, quicklime, hydrated lime, and lime slurry.  The accounting policies of the lime and limestone operations segment are the same as those described in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
In evaluating the operating results of the Company, the CODM assesses performance for the lime and limestone operations segment and decides how to allocate resources (including, but not limited to, decisions on fuel blends, capital purchases, and staffing levels) based on net income that is also reported on the consolidated statements of income.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as “Total assets” and the measure of segment capital expenditures is reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows as “Purchase of property, plant, and equipment.”

ITEM 9A.  CONTROL
S AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
  The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report were effective.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). Based on the assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
  No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
