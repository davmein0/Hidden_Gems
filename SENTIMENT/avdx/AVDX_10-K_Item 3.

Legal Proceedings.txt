We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including those described in the sections titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such factors may be updated in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the “SEC"). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.

You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have filed with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

Additionally, certain information we include herein or elsewhere (including our website) is informed by various third-party frameworks or other stakeholder expectations, and therefore is not necessarily material for purposes of our United States federal securities filings, even if we use "material" or similar language. Particularly, for certain environmental, social, or other sustainability matters, materiality relies on varying definitions that differ from, and are often more expansive than, the definition under United States federal securities laws.

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words “we,” “our,” “us,” “AvidXchange,” and “our Company” refer to AvidXchange, Inc. prior to our 2021 reorganization, and to AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries following the reorganization, unless the context requires otherwise.
