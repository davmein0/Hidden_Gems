Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Risks Related to Growth

We have a history of operating losses and we may not sustain profitability in the future.

We have a history of incurring operating losses. We were incorporated in 2000 and, prior to the second quarter of 2024, have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. While we achieved our first-ever GAAP net

13

income in the second and third quarters of 2024, we may not be able to sustain or increase our growth or achieve profitability in the future. We generated net income of $8.1 million, net losses of $47.3 million, and net losses of $101.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $1,014.0 million and $1,022.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our losses in previous periods reflect the substantial investments we have made in our people, products and services, technology, to acquire new buyers and suppliers, and to build the AvidPay Network.

We intend to continue to expend significant funds to invest in our people, products and services, technology, and the AvidPay Network, expand our sales and marketing teams, and invest in strategic partnerships and system integrations. While our revenue has significantly grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may generate losses in future periods. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and the value of our business and stock may significantly decrease.

Our future revenue and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, expand sales to our existing customers, or deliver new features, functionality and integrations for our platform that achieve market acceptance.

To continue to grow our business, it is important that we continue to attract new buyers and suppliers to use our platform. Our success in adding new buyers depends on numerous factors, including our ability to: (1) offer compelling AP automation products and services and features in the markets and industries we serve, (2) execute our sales and marketing strategy, (3) attract, effectively train and retain new sales, marketing, professional services, and support personnel in the markets we pursue, (4) develop or expand relationships with accounting and enterprise resource planning, or "ERP", software providers, payment providers, systems integrators, and referral and reseller partners, (5) expand into new industry verticals, geographies, and market segments, which may require specific product and service features or system integrations that we do not currently provide or have, (6) efficiently onboard new buyers on to our platform, (7) efficiently add more suppliers to our network and continue to drive increased adoption of electronic forms of payment, (8) execute a successful mergers and acquisitions strategy, and (9) provide additional paid services that complement the capabilities of our customers and their partners.

Our ability to increase revenue also depends in part on our ability to retain existing buyers and suppliers, to sell more functionality and to increase product penetration with existing and new buyers and suppliers. Our buyers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. In addition, some of our buyers can terminate their existing agreements with us prior to the expiration of the current contract terms or may have no minimum commitments in their agreements. Our ability to increase sales to existing buyers depends on several factors, including their experience with implementing and using our platform, their ability to integrate our platform with other technologies, and our pricing model. Suppliers in our network select their preferred method of payment, which currently includes primarily VCC, ACH, and check, based on their internal business rules, preferences, or perceived value, which may change at any time. Our ability to increase sales to suppliers already in our AvidPay Network depends on several factors, including our pricing model, data, ease of payment acceptance, their experience enrolling in and using our platform, and the development of new supplier product offerings.

Given the highly fragmented nature of the middle market, and the unique challenges faced by middle market buyer customers, the lack of certain product features, product functionality and system integrations have from time to time limited our ability to sell our products and services more deeply into certain of the sub-markets and industries that we serve and has limited our ability to expand into new industry verticals and sub-markets. If we are unable to deliver new product and services features and functionalities and system integrations, or keep pace with current technological developments, in each case in a timely manner, or if our new product and services features and functionalities and system integrations do not achieve acceptance in the market and industries we serve, our competitive position may be impaired, and our potential to generate new revenue or to retain existing revenue could be diminished. The adverse effect on our financial results may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales, and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new functionality and services.

Our historical growth may not be indicative of our future performance and we may not be able to sustain our current growth rate, which is dependent on a number of factors that we do not control.

Although we have experienced significant historical revenue and transaction volume growth, our growth rates have and may continue to decline over time, particularly as our revenue and transaction volumes increase to higher levels. Our revenue and transaction volume growth, including the number of invoices and payments that we process on our network, depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•
attract and retain buyers and suppliers and grow the AvidPay Network and the number of invoices and payments processed by us and drive the use of our products and services across our customer base;

14

•
drive the acceptance and use of electronic payment types that result in interchange revenue;

•
expand the functionality and scope of the products and services we offer;

•
expand into new and existing verticals and industries and geographies which may require specific product and service features that we do not currently provide;

•
develop new integrations with third party accounting or ERP systems;

•
successfully invest in our technology, products and people;

•
manage the impact of current macroeconomic events on our business and on our buyers and suppliers, including as a result of changes in United States trade policies, such as new or increased tariffs, and retaliatory responses from other countries; 

•
enter into new strategic partnerships including relationships with financial institutions, payment processing and other service providers and reseller and referral partners;

•
convince the stakeholders of potential buyers to outsource functions that they have traditionally handled internally; 

•
price our products and services effectively; and 

•
execute a successful mergers and acquisition strategy.

Further, the revenue that we derive from our invoice and payment transaction volume is dependent on several factors that we do not control. These factors include the number of invoices and payments, and the total amount of such invoices and payments, our buyers submit through our system, card brand interchange rates and tiers, the payment method selected by suppliers in our network, and competitive pricing pressure on products and incentives. In recent periods, macroeconomic conditions have affected our buyers and suppliers and the rate of spending generally and could continue to adversely affect our buyers and suppliers’ ability or willingness to use our services and could result in our buyers and suppliers more tightly managing spend and expenses or delaying purchasing decisions or eliminating certain discretionary spending which could in turn reduce the number of transactions and value of payments made on our network, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Looking forward, we expect the macroeconomic environment in 2025 and its impact on the business of our customers and our business to be affected by interest rates, new federal policies on tariffs, immigration, taxes, deregulation, fiscal sustainability, and consumer and business sentiment. The impact of these macroeconomic conditions on the acceptance rate of electronic forms of payment on our network that result in interchange revenue remains uncertain although we have seen and may continue to see pressure on the cost of these forms of payment from certain customers in our network.

These factors make it difficult for us to control or forecast our future operating results and growth. If the assumptions we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability and the value of our business could be negatively impacted. You should not rely on our growth rates from any prior periods as any indication of our future growth.

We participate in highly competitive and fragmented markets, and our industry is rapidly evolving.

The accounts payable and payments markets are highly fragmented and competitive and evolving. As businesses continue to adopt accounts payable and payment automation solutions, we expect existing competitors and new market entrants to offer new and enhanced products and services and we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. We also expect artificial intelligence and machine learning to continue to be leveraged by competitors, both new and existing, and to play an increasing role in the accounts payable and payment automation space. We currently compete on several factors, including:

•
product and service features, functionality and quality and system stability which may be highly industry or vertical specific;

•
integrations with leading accounting or ERP providers and banking systems;

•
pricing and incentives;

•
supplier network;

•
ability to automate existing processes; and

•
customer onboarding time and effort.

Our current competitors range from other fintech companies and financial institutions to smaller, niche providers of software and services. We compete with companies that offer comprehensive solutions focused on the entire AP and payment processes and companies that focus only on select portions of these processes such as invoice and bill presentment, document and workflow

15

management, AP and payment processing or accounts receivables. Solutions are also often specifically tailored to industry vertical or customer size making it difficult to expand into new verticals or attract larger or smaller customer types.

Accounting and ERP software providers, financial institutions, payment processing, and other service providers, a number of which we partner with in offering our solutions, may currently offer or develop solutions, acquire third-party solutions or competitors, or enter into strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their solutions to compete more effectively with our products and services. These parties may have access to larger, installed customer bases and may be able to effectively bundle and cross sell competitive solutions with their other services, which may enable them to compete more effectively or provide them with greater pricing and operating flexibility.

Companies that currently focus on providing solutions to enterprise businesses or SMBs may seek to expand the offering of their solutions to middle customers which would be more directly competitive with the products and services that we offer. We are continuing to see increased competition in the middle market from competitors going upstream and downstream from their traditional markets and we often compete for customers that are larger or smaller than our typical middle market buyers with service providers that are more established with this customer type. New entrants not currently considered to be competitors may also enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships.

While we are continuing to see increased competition from third parties, when we are selling our products and services to potential customers, we believe that we are often competing with internal legacy processes, and we must be able to convince internal stakeholders that our products and solutions are superior to these existing processes or other third-party solutions.

For the reasons mentioned above, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and this competition could result in the failure of our products and services to continue to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We earn a substantial portion of our revenue from electronic payment transactions and our growth is dependent upon the continued acceptance, adoption and security of electronic payment types that result in interchange revenue.

We earn a substantial portion of our revenue from VCC and ACH payment transactions paid to suppliers in our network and our growth is dependent upon the continued acceptance, security, and adoption of electronic payment types that result in interchange revenue on the amount of the transactions. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, we earned approximately $258.9 million in revenue from VCC and AvidPay Direct, our ACH product offering, paid through our network.

Although we expect businesses to continue to accept and adopt electronic forms of payment, we do not mandate a specific payment type in our network and the adoption rates of electronic payments in accounts payable transactions could erode or grow more slowly than expected or we could continue to see pressure on interchange rates or amounts customers are willing to pay for electronic forms of payment. Suppliers in our network select their preferred method of payment, which may include primarily VCC, ACH, or check, based on their internal business rules, preferences, or perceived value, which may change at any time and which may change in different economic environments such as a recession. Additionally, accounts receivable, or AR, service providers market and sell their AR services to suppliers and groups of supplier types in our network. These service providers may not accept electronic payments and may convert existing suppliers in our network that accept electronic payments to check. Suppliers in our network, and those AR service providers, may, with or without advance notice and without our knowledge, prohibit or impose restrictions on the methods we use to provide or deliver electronic payments, including by changing or including restrictions in the terms of use or service of online portals through which we make payments, that we may not be aware of or be able to comply with, seek to negotiate reduced pricing, or charge fees in order to accept electronic payments. Certain suppliers, including, larger enterprise suppliers, industries and verticals are also less inclined to accept electronic forms of payment which may limit our ability to successfully expand into new industries or verticals. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, fluctuations in quarterly revenue and yield metrics resulting from suppliers or AR service providers changing their preferred method of payment in our network, leveraging data to reduce their interchange rates, or seeking to negotiate reduced costs associated with their accepted electronic form of payment. It also remains unclear the extent to which macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, new federal policies on tariffs, immigration, taxes, deregulation, and fiscal sustainability, will impact the acceptance and adoption rates of electronic forms of payment. A significant shift in payment preference from electronic forms of payment to check or to lower cost forms of electronic payment by suppliers in our network in response to these or other factors could have a material impact on our business.

The revenue we receive from electronic payment transactions is also dependent upon a number of factors, many of which we do not control, including the continued acceptance and adoption by businesses of electronic payments, interchange rates which we expect to decline over time, fees charged by suppliers or AR aggregators to accept electronic payments, buyer incentives, and the terms of our commercial agreements with third-party service providers that are involved in the payment process. Widespread adoption of new forms of electronic payments, such as real time payments, could also negatively impact the revenue we receive from electronic payment transactions.

16

Future regulation or changes by the card brand payment networks could also have a substantial impact on interchange rates and our revenue from VCC transactions. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the card brand payment networks or future regulation, or if, merchant/suppliers elect to receive payments that result in lower or no interchange revenue such as check, or apply fees in consideration of accepting electronic forms of payment, our total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth, and overall business could be materially or adversely affected.

Certain of our customer segments are cyclical.

Certain segments of our customers, particularly the customers that focus on political advertising within our media vertical, are subject to seasonal and cyclical trends. Revenue from these customers is cyclical as it is connected to election advertising spend within the United States which tends to increase during significant election years, such as mid-term and presidential elections. In 2022, we experienced growth in our media payments business due to spending associated with the 2022 mid-term elections. Due to the intermittent nature of the election cycle in the United States, we saw a significant decrease in these revenues during fiscal year 2023. While we experienced growth in our media payments business in connection with the United States' 2024 presidential election, such growth was difficult to forecast and did not meet the expectations that we set at the beginning of 2024. These factors may make it more difficult for us to control or forecast our future operating results and growth. If the assumptions we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability and the value of our business could be negatively impacted.

We may not be able to scale our business and technology quickly enough to meet our growth.

As we continue to grow and add buyers and suppliers and process additional transactions, and as we sign additional strategic partners, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure and computer network and to integrating with third-party applications to maintain the performance of our platform. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support, risk and compliance operations, and professional services, to serve our growing customer base.

We have also experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems that interfere with our customers’ ability to access and use our products and services. These events may be caused by a variety of factors, including capacity constraints due to increased use and transaction volumes, legacy infrastructure, architecture, code and processes, software and human errors, and issues caused by third party service providers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of our platform and our products and services especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex.

Any failure of or delay in our efforts to maintain, improve and scale our technology, infrastructure and platform could result in service interruptions, impaired system performance, and reduced customer satisfaction, which has resulted and could continue to result in higher customer attrition, decreased sales to new customers, or higher rates of requested refunds, all of which could hurt our revenue growth. Even if we are successful in these efforts to scale our business, they will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Like we have in the past with our acquisitions of Piracle, Strongroom, Ariett, Entryless, BankTEL, Core Associates, and FastPay, we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are completed. In addition, we may not successfully identify desirable acquisition targets or targets at valuations comparable to our valuation, or if we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate them effectively following the acquisition or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition or achieve our desired synergies. Integration may prove to be difficult due to the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and who are accustomed to different corporate cultures.

We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquired business due to a number of factors, including:

•
inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;

•
unanticipated costs or liabilities, including legal liabilities, associated with the acquisition;

•
difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;

17

•
difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our current and future offerings and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue model of the acquired company;

•
diversion of management’s attention or resources from other business concerns;

•
adverse effects on our existing business relationships with customers, members, or strategic partners as a result of the acquisition;

•
the potential loss of key employees; and

•
use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.

Acquisitions could result in lower cash reserves, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, as well as unfavorable accounting treatment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and could cause the per share value of our common stock to decline. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. We also may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset the costs and expenses related to any acquisitions. If our acquisitions do not yield the expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, and our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.

Our business depends, in part, on our relationships with providers of accounting and ERP solutions.

Our relationships with accounting and ERP solutions partners are integral to our ability to deliver our products and services particularly to our buyer customers. We rely upon their cooperation to develop and maintain integrations between our products and services and their respective solutions. These integrations allow information to be communicated between our products and services and our customers’ accounting systems. These partners may also market and promote our products and services to customers. We also compete with accounting and ERP solution providers, including those with whom we partner, from time to time that have developed or offer third party products and services that are competitive with our products and services.

We believe that many accounting and ERP solution providers are increasingly focusing on accounts payable and payment automation to improve their product offering. Our business could be harmed if current or prospective partners decide to design their own AP solutions, partner with competitive service providers instead of us, or seek improved economics from us in connection with our partnership.

If we were unable to continue these relationships and add relationships with new accounting and ERP solutions partners, our growth prospects could be negatively impacted by not being able to offer necessary integrations to customers.

Our long-term growth strategy depends, in part, on strategic partnerships and indirect sales partners.

We continue to expand and leverage our current strategic partner relationships and to develop new strategic partner relationships to expand our sales and marketing efforts and our product and service offerings that we believe will allow us to sell and market our services in existing and new markets. Establishing strategic partner relationships, particularly with our financial institution customers and accounting software providers, entails extensive and highly specific upfront sales efforts and investment, with little predictability and various ancillary requirements.

For example, our partners may require us to submit to an exhaustive security audit, given the sensitivity and importance of storing their customer billing and payment data on our platform. As a result, formalizing and maintaining new strategic partner relationships involve a degree of effort and risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with direct customer sales. With strategic partners, the decision to enter into a relationship with us frequently requires the approval of multiple management personnel and technical personnel. Additionally, sales to strategic partners’ customers may require us to invest more time educating and selling to these potential customers. Purchases of our services by customers of strategic partners are also frequently subject to delays and require considerable efforts to negotiate and document relationships with them. Further, we may integrate our platform with our strategic partners’ own websites and apps, which requires significant time and resources to design and deploy both before and after marketing and sales efforts begin. If we are unable to increase sales of our services through strategic partners and to manage the costs associated with these relationships, including without limitation, integrating with their systems and ongoing training for their marketing and sales personnel, our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely affected.

Our ability to attract new strategic partners may be limited by our commitments to provide our existing strategic partners with certain exclusivity and/or first rights to participate in certain channels or territories. We also may not be able to attract new strategic partners if our potential partners favor our competitors’ products or services over our services or choose to compete with our services directly. Certain of our strategic partners may have the resources and inclination to develop their own solutions to replace ours. Moreover, strategic partners could decide to focus on other market segments. Further, there can be no guarantee that our strategic partners will not choose to terminate their relationships with us for strategic or other reasons. If we are

18

unsuccessful in establishing, growing, or maintaining our relationships with strategic partners, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer.

The loss of one or more of our key buyers or strategic partners could negatively affect our ability to market our platform.

We rely on our reputation and recommendations from key buyers and strategic partners in order to promote our platform. The loss of any of our key buyers or strategic partners could have a significant impact on our revenues, reputation and our ability to obtain new customers. Some of our key buyers have the ability to terminate their existing agreements without cause prior to the expiration of the applicable term and our suppliers, including our larger suppliers, are under no obligation to accept payments in a particular format. In addition, acquisitions of our buyers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers by the acquiring companies, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers, or the acquiring buyers may seek to leverage more favorable pricing and terms.

Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates as we could fail to capture the market share that we anticipate.

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates or we could fail to secure the portion of market share we expect.

If we fail to maintain or grow our brand recognition, our ability to expand our base of suppliers and buyers will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.

We believe that growing the AvidXchange brand is important to supporting continued acceptance of our existing and future solutions, attracting new buyers and suppliers to our platform, and retaining existing buyers and suppliers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide a reliable and useful platform to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers’ trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and solutions, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform. Additionally, our partners’ performance may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue. Even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain enough existing customers to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.

Risks Related to Operations

We transfer large sums of customer funds daily, and are subject to the risk of errors, which could result in financial losses and damage to our reputation and customer trust.

We processed over 79 million transactions for our customers in 2024. We have grown rapidly and seek to continue to grow, and although we maintain risk management processes, our business is always subject to, and we have experienced and will likely continue to experience, financial losses as a result of operational errors, software defects, service disruption, third party fraud, employee misconduct, security breaches, credit losses, or other similar actions or errors. Furthermore, we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our reconciliation of funds held for customers, and while we remediated this material weakness in 2021, we may experience additional material weaknesses in the future.

As a provider of AP and payment solutions, we collect and transfer funds on behalf of our customers. Software errors in our platform, operational errors by our employees and business partners, and fraud have exposed us to losses from time to time. Moreover, our trustworthiness and reputation are fundamental to our business. As a provider of cloud- based software for complex back-office financial operations, the occurrence of any operational errors, software defects, service disruption, third party fraud, employee misconduct, security breaches, credit losses or other similar actions or errors on our platform could result in financial losses to our business and our customers, loss of trust, damage to our reputation, or termination of our agreements with strategic partners, each of which could result in:

•
loss of buyers and suppliers;

•
lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products and services;

•
legal claims against us, including warranty and service level agreement claims;

•
regulatory enforcement action;

•
diversion of our resources, including through increased service expenses; and

•
financial concessions, and increased insurance costs.

19

Although our terms of service generally allocate to our customers the risk of loss resulting from our customers’ errors, omissions, employee fraud, or other fraudulent activity related to their systems, some of our customers may be able to negotiate changes to this position or in some instances we may cover such losses for efficiency or to prevent damage to our reputation, irrespective of fault or our terms of service. Although we maintain insurance to cover losses resulting from our errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all losses or our coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses or that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance. If we suffer significant losses or reputational harm as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We depend on banks, bank partners and other third-party service providers to process transactions.

We depend on a limited set of bank partners and other third-party service providers to process electronic payment transactions and check payments for our customers. We have entered into treasury services agreements and other arrangements with our bank partners and other third-party service providers for payment processing and related services. If these arrangements are terminated for any reason, or if services provided by our bank partners and other third-party service providers are interrupted, we could experience delays, interruptions, and additional costs in processing payments for our customers. We also depend on third-party service providers for other critical functions, including customer invoicing and scanning solutions. We have entered into service agreements with these third-party service providers for scanning, indexing and related services, and these agreements include significant security, compliance, and operational obligations. If our agreements with the scanning and/or indexing partners are terminated for any reason, we could experience service interruptions as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for new services.

Although we were not materially or directly impacted by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023, which was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and for which the FDIC was appointed as receiver, any future failure of any of our banking partners or any future instability, whether actual or perceived, in the global banking system could result in additional bank failures, as well as volatility of global financial markets, each of which may adversely impact our business and financial condition.

Interruptions or delays in the services provided by third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure and platforms or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our products and services.

We host our products and platform principally on a cloud platform leveraging public cloud infrastructure services. Public cloud services are provided by Microsoft Azure and others which include infrastructure as a service and use a service technologies platform. All products utilize resources operated by us through these providers. Therefore, we depend on these third parties to protect their infrastructure and operations against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, and similar events. We have periodically experienced service disruptions in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience interruptions or delays in our service in the future. If disruptions were to occur, we would have to operate using our disaster recovery plan, as we do not have a fully redundant system for all of our core functions. This could cause substantial disruption in our operations if we were not able to move our main processes in a timely manner to a backup service provider. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data services we use.

Although we have disaster recovery plans, any incident affecting the infrastructure of our third-party providers that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, military actions, terrorist attacks, negligence, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our platform. Any prolonged service disruption affecting our platform for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems, could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting.

Our platform is accessed by many customers, often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of cloud service providers, internet service providers, or other third-party service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to grow our business and scale our operations. If our third-party infrastructure service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to cloud-based infrastructure, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.

Our agreements with our buyer customers and certain partners typically contain service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, we may be contractually obligated to provide these buyer customers with service

20

credits. In addition, we could face contract terminations and, if the disruptions are substantial, impacts to our reputation, revenue, and operating results.

If we fail to offer high-quality customer support, or if our support is more expensive than anticipated, our business and reputation could suffer.

Both our buyers and suppliers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues and realize the full benefits provided by our products and services. High-quality support is also important for the renewal and expansion of our products and services with existing customers. We primarily provide customer support over chat, email and phone-based support. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if our support personnel or methods of providing support are insufficient to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to retain customers, increase the density of our supplier network and acquire new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could be harmed.

Risks Related to Electronic Payments

We are subject to the payment card network rules and our failure to comply with these rules could harm our business.

We use Mastercard branded VCCs exclusively, as contractually required by our agreement with Mastercard, in connection with our VCC payment service and we are subject to payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. AvidXchange was not previously PCI-DSS compliant, but first obtained its PCI-DSS certification in May 2021. There can be no assurances that AvidXchange will be able to maintain this certification. Failure to maintain this certification, or any prior or future violations of existing or new rules of the payment card network, or increased fees, could result in the revocation of our ability to make payments using VCCs, or such payments could become prohibitively expensive for us or for our customers. If we are unable to make buyer payments to suppliers using VCCs, our business would be adversely affected as we derive a significant portion of our revenue from interchange. We also may seek to introduce other card-related products in the future, like our contemplated spend management product, which may entail additional operating rules.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

The cybersecurity incident that we detected in early April 2023, or other cyber incidents that we may encounter in the future, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

In early April 2023, we detected a cybersecurity incident as part of our routine security monitoring protocols. In response to the incident, we undertook an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts, reached out to law enforcement, accelerated planned security enhancements, and have taken and will continue to take actions to implement additional safeguards.

The investigation determined that the incident primarily affected systems that were used for back-office activities. Data was exfiltrated from these systems and posted on the dark web. The data consisted of confidential information from our files, including personally identifiable information, primarily of our employees, former employees, and their dependents, and the bank account information of some customers. We cooperated with inquiries about the incident from three state consumer and financial regulators, provided notices to impacted customers and individuals and complied with regulatory requirements of various states that address notice and credit monitoring. We delivered all required notices during the fourth quarter of 2023 and consider our investigation to be complete.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $0.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in response costs related to the incident, including professional services and legal fees, and recorded insurance recoveries of $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. No liability for loss was recorded related to the incident as of December 31, 2024.

Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing partners or other customers, prevent us from obtaining new partners and other customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations, class action litigation, and costs associated with remediation, such as fraud monitoring and forensics. Accordingly, our recent cybersecurity incident or other cyber incidents that we may encounter in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

We, our strategic partners, our buyers and suppliers, and others who use our services obtain and process a large amount of data. Any real or perceived improper or unauthorized use of, exposure of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation as a trusted brand, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business.

We, our strategic partners, our buyers and suppliers, and the third-party vendors and providers of cloud-based infrastructure and data services that we use, obtain and process large amounts of data, including confidential information, along with personal and other data related to our buyers and suppliers and their transactions, as well as other data of the counterparties to their payments.

21

We face risks, including financial risks and risks to our reputation as a trusted brand, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new products and technologies.

Cybersecurity incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of cloud-based services, including us, financial institutions and other providers of financial services, have frequently been targeted by such attacks. Additionally, we expect to see an increase in cybersecurity incidents and malicious internet-based activity, including events directed by state sponsored entities, such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These cybersecurity challenges, including threats to our own IT infrastructure or those of our customers or third-party providers, may take a variety of forms ranging from stolen bank accounts, business email compromise, customer employee fraud, supply-chain attacks, ransomware, account takeover, check fraud, or cybersecurity attacks, to “mega breaches” targeted against cloud-based services and other hosted software, which could be initiated by individual or groups of hackers or sophisticated cyber criminals. A cybersecurity incident or breach could result in disclosure of data and intellectual property, or cause production downtimes and compromised data. We have in the past experienced cybersecurity incidents such as phishing attempts to compromise employee email and malware. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used in the future to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred, especially given that actors are now using advanced technologies such as AI to avoid detection. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, third parties may increasingly seek to compromise our security controls or gain unauthorized access to our sensitive corporate information or our customers’ data.

If our protection or security measures, or those of the previously mentioned third parties are inadequate or expose vulnerabilities or are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor action or inaction, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, software bugs or defects in our products, trickery, process failure, or otherwise, and, as a result, there is improper disclosure of, or someone obtains unauthorized access to or exfiltrates funds or sensitive information, including PII, on our systems or our partners’ systems, or if we suffer a ransomware or advanced persistent threat attack, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged. Recent high-profile security breaches and related disclosures of data by large institutions suggest that the risk of such events is significant, even if privacy protection and security measures are implemented and enforced. If sensitive information is lost or improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur significant costs associated with remediation and the implementation of additional security measures, and may incur significant liability and financial loss, and be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, proceedings, and penalties.

In addition, if our financial institutions or strategic partners conclude that our systems and procedures are insufficiently rigorous, they could terminate their relationships with us, and our financial results and business could be adversely affected. If there is a breach of the information that we store, we could be liable to our partners for their losses and related expenses. Additionally, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially and adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing partners or other customers, prevent us from obtaining new partners and other customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations, class action litigation, and costs associated with remediation, such as fraud monitoring and forensics. Any actual or perceived security breach at a company providing services to us or our customers could have similar effects.

While we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient or may not cover all liabilities incurred by such incidents. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us with sufficient limits or on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.

Risks Related to Talent Acquisition and Retention

If we lose key members of our team including our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, or if we are unable to attract and retain talent, our business may be harmed.

Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our team and other key employees. Our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Praeger, is critical to our overall strategic direction, our culture, and the development of key products, partnerships and relationships. Our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis. The loss of our chief executive officer, one or more members of our senior management, or other key employees, could harm our business, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements.

22

To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Our headquarters and primary center of employment is in Charlotte, North Carolina. In general, the talent pool in Charlotte may be smaller than in other geographic areas. Competition for executive officers, software developers and engineers, compliance and risk management personnel, and other key employees in our industry and location is intense and increasing, and we may not be able to attract the talent we need to grow and succeed. We compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing cloud-based software and payment systems, as well as for skilled legal and compliance and risk operations professionals. The current regulatory environment related to immigration may increase the likelihood that immigration laws may be modified to further limit the availability of H1-B and other visas. If a new or revised visa program is implemented, it may impact our ability to recruit, hire, retain or effectively collaborate with qualified skilled personnel, including in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, payment systems and risk management, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do, such as many of the larger banks in the Charlotte, North Carolina area, and can frequently offer such personnel substantially greater compensation than we can offer, and may be in geographies perceived by some employees as more desirable. If we fail to identify, attract, develop, and integrate new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects would be adversely affected.

Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our base of buyers and suppliers and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.

Our ability to increase our base of buyers and suppliers and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations, and to deploy our sales and marketing resources efficiently. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force as well as our sales force focused on identifying new strategic and indirect sales partners. We also dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs. Our business and operating results will be harmed if those efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs and advertising are not effective.

If we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed.

We believe that a critical component of our success has been our company culture, which is based on our core values of ensuring customer success, focusing on results and striving for excellence. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture. If we fail to preserve our culture, our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives could be compromised, potentially harming our business.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

We may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers if we are unable to deliver new software, solutions and technology for our platform.

Our success depends on our continued development of new and improved AP automation software and payment solutions and related technology and the continued automation of payments processes. If we are unable to deliver new products or services, such as our spend management offering, or to enhance or achieve market acceptance with existing products and services, such as Payment Accelerator or if we are unable to integrate technology, products and services that we acquire into our platform, our business could be adversely affected through increased attrition of current customers or slower addition of new customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our platform, and we have discovered, and may in the future discover, errors in new releases after their introduction. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our platform or customer claims, including, among other things, warranty claims against us, any of which could cause us to lose existing customers or affect our ability to attract new customers.

Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection, and other losses.

Our agreements with partners and certain customers may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, data protection, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform or other contractual obligations. Some of these indemnity agreements provide for uncapped liability and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we normally limit our liability with respect to such obligations in our contracts with direct customers and with customers acquired through our partners, we may still incur substantial liability, and we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform or products, as a result of IP-related claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to these obligations could have

23

adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing or new customers, and harm our business and operating results. In addition, although we carry insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed, or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, and any such coverage may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

If we are unable to effectively document or perfect our ownership over our proprietary technology and intellectual property, our ability to protect our proprietary rights against third parties might be adversely affected.

Historically, we have developed our proprietary technology and other intellectual property both internally, through development by our employees and consultants, and externally, through engaging third party developers in the United States and abroad. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with such employees, consultants and third party developers with the expressed intention that we own all proprietary rights in all applicable technology and intellectual property developed during the relationship. However, it is possible that these agreements may not have been properly entered into on every occasion with the applicable counterparty, and if one of these agreements were found to be defective under applicable law, it may not have effectively granted ownership of certain technology or other intellectual property to us. In such an event, there would be a risk that the applicable counterparty would not be available to (or would not be willing to) assist us in perfecting our ownership of the technology or intellectual property, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to protect our proprietary rights over such technology and intellectual property.

If we are unable to obtain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to develop platform enhancements may be impaired.

We utilize commercially available off-the-shelf technology in the development of our products and services. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to our products and services, we may be required to license additional technologies from third parties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies with lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of our platform and our business. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products and services or to develop enhancements to our technology, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to use third-party software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Uncertainty in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our operations and in our products and services may result in harm to our business and reputation.

We are continuing to increasingly use artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning, and automated decision-making technologies, across various aspects of our business operations, and we are making investments in expanding AI capabilities in our products, services and tools, including continuing to build systems and tools that incorporate AI-based technologies, such as, invoice capture and indexing, prepopulating customer inputs based on historical data and modeling creditworthiness.

We expect that developing, testing, and deploying resource-intensive AI systems may require additional investment to continuously improve our use of AI technologies. As with many technological innovations, there are significant risks involved in developing, maintaining and deploying these technologies and there can be no assurance that the usage of or our investments in such technologies will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. As it evolves, AI presents risks and challenges that could adversely impact our business. Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize our products or services involving AI technologies could depress the market price of our stock and impair our ability to: raise capital; expand our business; provide, improve and diversify our product offerings; continue our operations and efficiently manage our operating expenses; and respond effectively to competitive developments.

In particular, if the models underlying our AI technologies are incorrectly designed or implemented; trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased or otherwise poor quality data, or on data to which we do not have sufficient rights or in relation to which we and/or the providers of such data have not implemented sufficient legal compliance measures; used without sufficient oversight and governance to ensure their responsible use; and/or adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cybersecurity threats or material performance issues, the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation and the reputations of our customers, could suffer or we could incur liability resulting from the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims. The development, adoption, and use for generative AI technologies are still in their early stages. AI algorithms that we use may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient, risking inaccurate or misleading content or discriminatory or unexpected results, such as hallucinatory behavior generating irrelevant, nonsensical, or factually incorrect results, harming our reputation, business, or customer relationships. While we take measures designated to ensure the accuracy of such AI generated content, those measures may not always be successful, and in some cases, we may need to rely on end users to report such inaccuracies. In addition, any latency, disruption, or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our offerings.

24

Complexities and Risks in AI Product Development and Deployment May Impact Our Business and Competitive Edge.

We are in varying stages of development in relation to our products and internal business processes involving AI technologies. The continuous development, maintenance and operation of our AI technologies may involve unforeseen difficulties including material performance problems, undetected defects, or errors. For instance, the models underlying AI technologies can experience decay (also known as “model drift”) in which its performance and accuracy decreases over time without further human intervention to correct such decay.

We may not be successful in our ongoing development and maintenance of these technologies in the face of novel and evolving technical, reputational and market factors. Our efforts to develop proprietary AI models could increase our operating costs. Our ability to develop proprietary AI models may be limited by our access to processing infrastructure or training data, and we may be dependent on third-party providers for such resources.

We face significant competition from other companies in our industry in relation to the development and deployment of AI technologies. Those other companies may develop AI technologies that are similar or superior to ours and/or are more cost-effective and/or quicker to develop, deploy and maintain. Any inability to develop, offer or deploy new AI technologies as effectively, as quickly and/or as cost-efficiently as our competitors could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results, customer relationships and growth. In addition, third parties may deploy AI technologies in a manner that reduces customer demand for our products and services. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products and services or harm to our business, results of operations or reputation.

Further, our ability to continue to develop or use such technologies may be dependent on access to specific third-party software, services and infrastructure, such as processing hardware, and we cannot control the availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure, especially in a highly competitive environment.

Evolving Legal and Regulatory Frameworks for AI Technologies May Increase Compliance Costs and Operational Challenges.

The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. Many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability to develop, deploy or use AI technologies. Existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our AI technologies or could be rescinded or amended as new administrations take differing approaches to evolving AI technologies. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet completely determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or market perception of their requirements may have on our business. We may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations.

In the United States, legislation related to AI technologies has also been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level. For example, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently in the process of finalizing regulations under the CCPA regarding the use of automated decision-making. California also enacted seventeen new laws in 2024 that further regulate use of AI technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies’ use of AI technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. Other states have also passed AI-focused legislation, such as Colorado’s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will require developers and deployers of “high-risk” AI systems to implement certain safeguards against algorithmic discrimination, and Utah’s Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, which establishes disclosure requirements and accountability measures for the use of generative AI in certain consumer interactions. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use, procure and commercialize AI technologies in the future.

It is possible that further new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations, including competition and antitrust laws, may be interpreted in ways that would limit our ability to use AI technologies for our business, or require us to change the way we use AI technologies in a manner that negatively affects the performance of our products, services, and business and the way in which we use AI technologies. We may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions if the laws, regulations, or decisions are not consistent across jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws, could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI technologies). Such an increase in operating expenses, as well as any actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, we are subject to a number of current sector-specific laws and regulations which will be implicated by our use of AI technologies. For example, if we use artificial intelligence or machine learning tools to determine creditworthiness, and it becomes clear that the data that was used to train those models was biased, we or our customers could be accused of engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. It is also possible that the AI technologies we use may, or may be viewed as, having unintended biases or discriminatory outcomes, exposing us to risks that we have discriminated against persons belonging to a protected

25

class. Any resulting investigation or litigation could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to the associated costs and any related fines, and could also have an adverse impact on our customer relationships. See Regulatory Risks discussed below.

We use open-source software, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.

We use open-source software in the development of our products and services. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open-source software against companies that incorporate it into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open-source software in a certain manner under certain open-source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use or incorporate open-source software subject to certain types of open-source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our products, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products, or take other remedial actions.

If our technology and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.

We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright and patent applications. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. For example, we have not historically prioritized seeking patent protections for our technology and therefore we may have limited capacity to assert proprietary rights against third parties that may offer similar products, services or functionality. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, we cannot assure that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our solutions and any patents issued to us in the United States or other jurisdictions may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Specifically, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our solutions or design around our patents, or adopt similar or identical brands for competing platforms or technology. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Therefore, our registration applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished.

Further, intellectual property law, including statutory and case law, particularly in the United States, is constantly developing, and any changes in the law could make it harder for us to enforce our rights. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Failure to protect our domain names could also adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for subscribers to find our products and services. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.

We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform.

In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our intellectual property. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related patents, patent applications and trademark filings at risk of not being issued or being cancelled. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with

26

intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform, impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new functionality to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or injure our reputation. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously damage our brand and our business.

Risk Related to Financial Controls, Customer Funds, and Risk Management

Should we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or otherwise fail to design, implement, and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

In the past, we have identified certain control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. Specifically, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our reconciliation of funds held for customers, which was remediated in 2021. Further, in 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to an insufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training, and experience, including tenured experience at the Company, to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately, which we concluded was remediated as of March 31, 2024.

Any failure to design, implement, and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results of operations on a timely and accurate basis, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could limit our access to capital markets, adversely affect our results of operations and/or lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock. If our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to an increased risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list our common stock, to other regulatory investigations, and to civil or criminal sanctions.

Further, these types of fraudulent activities on our platform can also expose us to civil and criminal liability, governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially cause us to be in breach of our contractual obligations to our third-party partners and buyers or suppliers.

Customer funds held by us are subject to market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks, as well as general economic and political conditions. The loss of these funds and fluctuations in rates of return could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We arrange for funds of our customers, including funds that will be remitted to suppliers, to be held in cash or cash equivalents, and these funds may be invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities from time to time, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. Nevertheless, our customer fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in aggregate, during periods of heavy financial market volatility.

With respect to movements in interest rates, when rates are lowered, our payment revenue and interest income, resulting from the funds we hold for buyers, are negatively impacted. Should the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in 2025, we would expect to experience negative impacts on our payment revenue and interest income. A changing interest rate environment could also lead to difficulty in comparing our current consolidated financial results to our results in future reporting periods. Such unfavorable impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.

We are licensed as a money transmitter (or statutory equivalent) in all jurisdictions within the United States where, to the best of our knowledge, licensure is required for our business. Accordingly, we are subject to direct regulation by the licensing authorities

27

of the jurisdictions where we are licensed. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulatory authority, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of any outstanding customer liabilities. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, it may be necessary to scale the applicable internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to accurately manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, and result in significant penalties and fines, up to and including the loss of our state money transmitter licenses, which would materially harm our business.

In the event of a financial crisis, employment levels and interest rates may become volatile with a corresponding impact on our business. As a result, we could experience a constriction in the availability of liquidity, which may impact our ability to fulfill our obligations to enable the movement of customer funds to the intended recipients. Additionally, we rely upon certain banking partners and other third parties to originate ACH payments, process checks, execute wire transfers, and issue VCCs, and these banking partners and other third parties could be similarly affected by a liquidity shortage or sanctions or other restrictive actions by governmental agencies, which may further exacerbate our ability to operate our business. Any material loss of or inability to access customer funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations, could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.

Our overall investment portfolio is generally comprised of (i) our operating cash and (ii) buyer funds. Our operating cash includes cash received from revenues generated and existing cash on the balance sheet. Buyer funds are funds that have been collected from buyers, but not yet remitted to the applicable supplier.

Our operating cash is invested in accordance with our cash investment policy. Under that policy, we invest with the objective of preserving capital while optimizing yield. Permissible investments include United States Treasury instruments, United States Government Agency securities, Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, investment grade corporate bonds, money market funds, and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts.

Our buyer funds are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Pursuant to our investment policy and subject to applicable law, buyer funds may be invested in United States Treasury securities, United States Government Agency securities, Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities, certificates of deposit, or other cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, all buyer funds were invested in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. While we are in the process of diversifying our banking relationships, the majority of these demand accounts have been maintained at one institution which is a full-service, FDIC-insured national bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and is a subsidiary of a bank holding company subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve.

As we regularly maintain cash deposits, including buyer funds, that exceed the applicable FDIC insurance limits, volatility in the United States banking market can expose us to increased risk. While we do not currently maintain private insurance to mitigate this risk, and such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we seek to mitigate this risk by monitoring financial institutions that we conduct business with and endeavor to maintain cash balances at large well-capitalized financial institutions. In the event of one or more failures or a liquidity crisis in the United States banking market, we may be exposed to the risk of financial institutions' potential insolvency or failure and there can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the United States government, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition. In the event of the failure of one or more financial institutions with whom we do business, we could incur significant liquidity risks or losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.

Our risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by our customers or their counterparties or third parties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.

We offer products and services, including software, that digitize and automate back-office financial operations for a large number of buyers and execute payments to their suppliers. We are responsible for verifying the identity of our buyers and their users, and we monitor transactions for fraud. We and our buyers and our suppliers have been in the past, and will continue in the future to be, targeted by parties who seek to commit acts of financial fraud using techniques such as stolen identities and bank accounts, compromised business email accounts, employee or insider fraud, account takeover, false applications, and check fraud. We have suffered losses, and may continue to suffer losses in the future, from acts of financial fraud committed by our buyers and suppliers, their users, and third parties.

28

The techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform are continually evolving. In addition, when we introduce new products and functionality, or expand existing products, we may not be able to identify all risks created by the new products or functionality. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. Furthermore, our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may contain errors or our employees or agents may commit mistakes or errors in judgment as a result of which we may suffer large financial losses. The software-driven and highly automated nature of our platform could enable criminals and those committing fraud to steal significant amounts of money from businesses like ours. As greater numbers of customers use our platform, our exposure to material risk losses from a single customer, or from a small number of customers, will increase.

Our current business and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our risk management efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management infrastructure, policies, procedures, techniques, and processes. As techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform evolve, we may need to modify our products or services to mitigate fraud risks. As our business grows and becomes more complex, we may be less able to forecast and carry appropriate reserves in our books for fraud related losses.

Any future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.

We may become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought in connection with intellectual property disputes, claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims for reimbursement following the disclosure or misappropriation of customer funds or data.

The software industry is characterized by the existence of many patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, many companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. Any inability to license third-party technology in the future would have an adverse effect on our business or operating results and would adversely affect our ability to compete. We may also be contractually obligated to indemnify our customers in the event of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights.

Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management’s time and attention. Although we carry insurance, our insurance may not cover certain future claims, may not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.

We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot assure you that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

Natural catastrophic events and man-made problems such as power-disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches, war and terrorism may disrupt our business.

Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. Our headquarters and a large employee presence is located in Charlotte, North Carolina and we have smaller employee groups in areas in and around Burbank, California, Houston, Texas, Sandy, Utah, Birmingham, Alabama, and Framingham, Massachusetts. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our products, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Climate change and other environmental or social pressures are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of certain such events, as well as contribute to chronic changes (such as changes in meteorological or hydrological patterns) which may result in additional risks.

In addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover, or may not cover, our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks, or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance.

29

Risks Related to Credit and Liquidity

Certain of our products and services expose us to credit risk.

Certain of our products and services, including our Payment Accelerator product, expose us to credit risk. Payment Accelerator offers certain qualifying suppliers the opportunity to better manage cash flows and receive payments by enabling these suppliers to receive advance payment on eligible invoices. We may not receive payment on funds advanced and may otherwise be unable to recoup owed amounts from customers. While the development, release, and timing of any new products remain at the sole discretion of the Company and may be subject to change, we have been and will continue to be modifying and expanding this supplier product offering throughout 2025 which would expose us to additional credit risk. The success of any supplier advance payment product depends, in substantial part, on our ability to effectively manage non-payment and default risks. To manage such risks, we may use techniques designed to analyze the businesses’ past purchase and transaction histories, risk models and third-party factoring tools, and other indicators to help predict the risk profile of these buyers and suppliers and make pricing and eligibility decisions accordingly. These techniques may not accurately predict loss rates or provide inputs on risked-adjusted pricing due to inaccurate assumptions, fluctuating market conditions, changes in the macroeconomic environment, or flawed or insufficient transaction history or other data, among other factors. Should credit losses be significant with our supplier advance payment product, our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely affected.

Our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets and personal property, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ actions, which could limit our operational flexibility and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.

Our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things (in each case, subject to certain exceptions based on dollar caps or other conditions):

•
incur additional indebtedness;

•
create additional liens on assets;

•
make certain investments;

•
dispose of assets;

•
engage in a merger or other similar transaction;

•
engage in transactions with affiliates; 

•
make certain restricted payments, including share repurchases and the payment of dividends; and

•
engage in new businesses, other than our primary B2B accounts payable, invoice, and payments businesses.

The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, measured on a consolidated basis:

•
there must be liquidity (which is defined as availability under the 2024 Revolver, plus unrestricted cash) that is more than the greater of (1) $35 million, and (2) 35% of the Revolving Amount (as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).

•
as of the end of each quarter, total revenue on a trailing four-quarter basis must be greater than the requirements set forth in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

•
for each period of four consecutive quarters, Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement must not be less than $10 million.

•
the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, must not exceed 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, and the Leverage Ratio must not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 during certain periods following an acquisition of a certain size.

•
the Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, must not be less than 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter.

Our or our subsidiaries’ failure to comply with the covenants or payment requirements, or the occurrence of other events specified in our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, could result in an event of default under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which would give our lenders, in addition to other rights and remedies, the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and to declare all outstanding loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees and any other outstanding amounts, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, we and our subsidiaries have granted our lenders under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement first-priority liens against substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets and property as collateral. If the debt under our 2024 Amended

30

and Restated Credit Agreement was to be accelerated, we might not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay the obligations then due. In such an event, the lenders under our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement would have the right to, among other remedies, enforce liens against our and our subsidiaries assets and property and seek other judicial and non-judicial enforcement of their rights, any or all of which would likely have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results.

If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any future debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price.

Regulatory Risks

Our business, which includes payment services and commercial lending, is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to civil and criminal liability.

Financial Services Regulation

In addition to the regulatory regimes described elsewhere, the local, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards that govern our payment and lending services include, or may in the future include, those relating to banking, invoicing, cross-border and domestic money transmission, lending, foreign exchange, payment processing and settlement services, and escheatment. These laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards are enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including federal regulators, self-regulatory organizations, and numerous state and local authorities.

As a licensed money transmitter and lender in various states and territories with the United States, we are subject to a range of restrictions and ongoing compliance obligations under applicable statutes and regulations administered by the financial services and banking departments of the various states and territories, including requirements with respect to the investment of customer funds, financial recordkeeping and reporting, reconciliation of customer funds, bonding, minimum capital, maximum interest rates, disclosure, and inspection, audit or examination by regulatory authorities concerning various aspects of our business. In a number of cases, evaluation of our compliance efforts depends on regulatory interpretations that could change over time. In the past, regulators have identified violations or alleged violations of certain statutory and regulatory regimes, and we have been subject to fines, a state consent order and financial penalties by state regulatory authorities due to their interpretation and application of their respective state money transmitter regime to our business model.

In the future, as a result of the financial services regulations applicable to our business, we will continue to be subject to routine examinations by state and federal regulatory authorities; any identified violations or non-compliance during the course of such examinations could subject us to liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other similar enforcement actions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses, regulatory approvals, or other similar authorizations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses, regulatory approvals, and other similar authorizations, and there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining any such licenses, approvals, or other similar authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are substantial costs involved in maintaining and renewing those licenses, regulatory approvals, and other similar authorizations that we currently hold, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate the various requirements applicable to us in connection with maintaining the same. These factors could impose substantial additional costs on us, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services to our customers, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in any given market.

Governmental authorities may impose new or additional rules on our activities, including regulations that:

•
prohibit, restrict, and/or impose taxes or fees on money transmission and lending transactions in, to or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals, or entities;

•
impose additional customer identification and customer due diligence requirements;

•
impose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;

•
impose higher minimum capital or other financial requirements;

•
require enhanced disclosures to customers utilizing our financial services;

31

•
limit the types of entities capable of providing money transmission services, lending services, or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;

•
limit or restrict the revenue that may be generated from money transmission and lending services, including revenue from interest earned on customer funds, transaction fees, and revenue derived from foreign exchange;

•
require the principal amount of money transmission originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until paid;

•
limit the number or principal amount of money transmission transactions that may be sent to or from a jurisdiction, whether by an individual or in the aggregate;

•
restrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country or region; or

•
impose other requirements in furtherance of their missions.

Other Regulation

Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business. We are subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards in the United States, which govern numerous areas important to our business. We will likely become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards in other jurisdictions if we expand our operations internationally in the future. In addition to those laws and regulations described elsewhere, our business is also subject to, without limitation, rules and regulations applicable to securities, labor and employment, immigration, competition, data usage, cybersecurity, and marketing and communications practices. These are subject to change, including by means of legislative action and/or executive orders and by way of evolving interpretations and applications of existing statutory and regulatory regimes by the applicable regulatory authorities. Thus, it may be difficult to predict how these changes will apply to our business and the way we conduct our operations, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative, or other developments, which, in turn, may impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products, and services and/or increase our cost of doing business.

Although we have a compliance program focused on the laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards that we have determined apply to our business, and although we continue to prioritize investments in this program, we can make no assurances that our employees or contractors will not violate such laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or industry standards (including as a result of any changes to the interpretation or application of the same) may:

•
subject us to significant fines, penalties, civil and criminal lawsuits, license suspension or revocation, forfeiture of significant assets, audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions by federal, state, local or foreign regulators, state attorneys general, or private plaintiffs who may be acting as private attorneys general pursuant to various applicable federal, state, and local laws;

•
result in additional compliance and licensure requirements;

•
increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; and

•
restrict our operations and force us to change our business practices or compliance program, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.

The complexity of federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the United States, coupled with the scope of any future international operations and the evolving regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to many overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.

Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation as a trusted provider, damage our brands and business, cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by violations and to avoid further violations, expose us to legal or regulatory risk and potential liability, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties, or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value

32

of our business and decrease the value of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.

Our buyers and other users store personal and business information, financial information and other sensitive information on our platform. In addition, we receive, store, and process personal and business information and other data from and about actual and prospective customers and users, in addition to our employees and service providers. Our handling of data may subject us to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards.

The federal government of the United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data. The laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change, and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Additionally, the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, as a result of the rapidly evolving regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide.

Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal, or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications, and information security, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality, use particular forms of data, and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data, or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our customers, partners, or end users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.

As we expand into new jurisdictions, the number of foreign laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards governing our business will expand. In addition, as we expand our business and develop new products and services, we may become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards. We may not always be able to accurately predict the scope or applicability of certain laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or industry standards to our business, particularly as we expand into new areas of operations, which could have a significant negative effect on our existing business and our ability to pursue future plans.

We are subject to governmental laws and requirements regarding economic and trade sanctions, export controls, anti-money laundering, and counter-terror financing that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to civil and criminal liability if we violate them.

Although we currently only operate in the United States, in the future, we may seek to expand internationally. In that case, we would become subject to additional laws and regulations, and would need to implement new controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We are required to comply with export control and economic and trade sanctions administered in the United States by the OFAC. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to provide compliance with these regulations and requirements, as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions, to the extent applicable. However, we cannot assure you that such policies and procedures will effectively prevent violations of these laws in the future. If we fail to comply with applicable export control and economic and trade sanctions laws, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business. We are also subject to various AML and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In the United States, most of our services are subject to AML laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations, or collectively, the BSA, and other similar laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transmitters to develop and implement risk-based AML programs, to report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and, in some cases, to collect and maintain information about customers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. Regulators in the United States and globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor transactions on our system, including payments to persons outside of the United States. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers, and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Regulators and third-party auditors have identified gaps in our AML program, and we could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, inquiries, audits, investigations, enforcement actions, and civil and criminal liability if such gaps are not sufficiently remediated or our AML program is found to violate the BSA by a regulator.

33

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to civil and criminal liability and harm our business and reputation.

We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the United States Travel Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations in any jurisdictions outside of the United States in which we may do business. These laws generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, making, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, anything of value to foreign government officials or commercial partners for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions.

Should we increase our international business, our risks under these laws may increase. Although we currently only maintain operations in the United States, as we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities; and we cannot assure that all of our employees and agents will comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and internal policies.

Detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas are received or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.

The increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social matters could increase our costs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.

There has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media, policymakers, nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders on companies' management of a variety of environmental, social and other sustainability matters, including climate change and human capital. We engage in various initiatives, including disclosures, to improve our ESG profile and respond to stakeholder expectation; however, such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many ESG initiatives leverage methodologies, standards and data that are complex, subject to competing interpretations, and continue to evolve. We cannot guarantee that our approach will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder. Moreover, various stakeholders have different, and at times, conflicting, expectations. Proponents and opponents of such matters are increasingly resorting to activism, including litigation, to advance their perspectives. There is also increasing regulatory scrutiny, including the adoption of certain reporting requirements, on such matters; however, such regulations are not uniform, and other policymakers have sought to constrain companies' consideration of environmental, social, or other sustainability matters in certain instances. Addressing stakeholder expectations or requirements entails costs and any failure to successfully navigate such expectations, as well as evolving interpretations of any existing governmental laws or requirements, may result in reputational harm, loss of customers or employees, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts to our business. Additionally, certain of our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders are subject to similar expectations, which may result in additional or increased risks.

Tax Related Risks

Our ability to use our net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.

As of December 31, 2024, our federal and state NOL carryforwards were $303.0 million and
 $
342.0 million, respectively. The federal NOLs include approximately $41.9 million that may be used to offset up to 100% of future taxable income. Generally, Federal and State NOLs generated in 2017 and prior are subject to expiration if not previously utilized before their 20-year life. Our NOLs started to expire in 2020 but we also have been able to utilize them in recent years. The NOL carryforwards subject to expiration could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income in such years. There is variation in how states have responded and may continue to respond to the Tax Act and CARES Act.

34

Separately, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In addition to limitations based on ownership changes, certain state legislatures have proposed suspensions or other limitations on the use of NOLs in order to address immediate revenue shortfalls. For these reasons, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce future tax liabilities may be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.

We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our offerings and adversely affect our operating results.

The vast majority of states have considered or adopted laws that impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. States where we have a nexus may require us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdiction. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al ("Wayfair") that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer’s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may enforce laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. We may be obligated to collect and remit sales and use tax in states in which we have not historically collected and remitted sales and use tax. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we historically have not or presently do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a perceived competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may adversely affect our operating results.

Our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:

•
changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions;

•
changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the Tax Act;

•
changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business; and

•
the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals, including limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

Any of these developments could adversely affect our operating results.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

You may be diluted by the future issuance of common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into common or preferred stock, in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, capital raises or otherwise.

We have 204,441,251 shares of common stock

outstanding as of February 24, 2025, and our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 1.6 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. 
O
ur board of directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders.

In the future, we may obtain additional financing or further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our capital stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, or debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Issuing additional shares of our capital stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Shares of preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. As a result, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.

35

As of February 24, 2025, we have reserved 34,170,612 shares of common stock for issuance under 
the Company's 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(the “2021 Plan”), which amount is increased by shares subject to outstanding awards under our previous equity incentive plans that expire, are forfeited, or otherwise terminate, are settled in cash or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or the purchase or exercise price. The number of shares of common stock that will be reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year by the lesser of (i) 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding year or (ii) 18,023,020 shares. Any common stock that we issue, including under our current equity incentive plans or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the owners of our common stock.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the market price of our common stock at the time you bought it and may lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and declined significantly and may continue to do so in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;

•
any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;

•
actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow us or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

•
additional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales;

•
hedging activities by market participants;

•
announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

•
changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our competitors;

•
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;

•
lawsuits threatened or filed against us;

•
developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; 

•
general economic conditions including inflation, fears of a possible recession, and increased volatility in the banking sector within the United States;

•
geopolitical tensions including those resulting from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the related responses, including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and/or other countries; and 

•
other events or factors, including those resulting from domestic political conditions, election cycles, war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.

In addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology and finance services companies’ stock prices. Stock prices often fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to a company’s operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and seriously harm our business.

Moreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.

36

Although our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, or your ability to sell your shares of our common stock when desired or at the prices that you may obtain for your shares.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

The price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders. We had a total of 204,441,251 shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 24, 2025.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales, or the perception that our shares may be available for sale, will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.

Certain of our stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares and/or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders, subject to market standoff and lockup agreements. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.

In addition, we have filed registration statements to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.

We may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

We have funded our operations up until mid-2024 primarily through equity financings, secured debt, sales of our products and services, and transaction fees. We cannot be certain if we will be able to continue to generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest heavily in our business and expend substantial financial and other resources on:

•
our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance, and security;

•
product development including investments in our product team and the development of new products and new functionality;

•
acquisitions or strategic investments;

•
sales, marketing and customer success, including an expansion of our sales organization; and

•
general administration, including increased legal, compliance, risk management and accounting expenses.

These investments may not result in increased revenue growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, or if we encounter difficulties in managing a growing volume of payments, we may be required to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional capital, which may be dilutive to our current stockholders. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including certain factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our current stock and diluting their interests.

If securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our common stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will be influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to

37

cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.

Delaware law, our status as a licensed money transmitter and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.

Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. For example, these provisions:

•
establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;

•
permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;

•
provide that directors may only be removed for cause;

•
require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;

•
authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;

•
prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;

•
prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;

•
provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;

•
restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware and enable the Company to initiate an action against a stockholder to enforce this exclusive forum requirements should the stockholder sue, or threaten to sue, in another jurisdiction;

•
establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;

•
require the stockholder proposing business or nominating directors to provide additional information about the stockholder’s ownership of securities in the Company (including ownership of derivative securities) and about any material litigation, relationships and interests in material agreements with or involving the Company;

•
require the stockholder to provide additional information regarding any candidate the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, including all information with respect to such nominee that would be required to be set forth in a stockholder’s notice if such nominee were a stockholder delivering such notice and a description of any direct or indirect material interest in any material contract or agreement between or among the nominating stockholder and each nominee or his or her respective associates; and

•
require the stockholder, proposing business, to provide additional information regarding the proposed business and any related agreements between the stockholder and any other beneficial holder and to provide a representation that such stockholder intends, or is part of a group which intends, to deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company’s outstanding capital stock required to carry the proposal (or otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal).

In addition, as a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to a complex regulatory framework, at both the state and federal level. Most, if not all, states require that the state regulator be notified of a change in control of the licensed entity, and many states require prior notice and approval of a change in control. While the definition of control varies by state, some states consider the acquisition of 10% of a licensed entity’s outstanding securities by an investor (or group of affiliated investors) to constitute a change in control.

38

Any notice or consent requirements imposed by individual state or federal regulatory agencies or provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, or any action asserting a claim for aiding and abetting such breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws(including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees or stockholders that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering. However, as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. Investors also cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us, our directors, officers, or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and we cannot assure you that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.

We must develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to develop and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.

We are required to comply with the SEC’s rules including implementing effective processes and internal control over financial reporting to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time consuming, or costly, and increases demand on our systems and resources, particularly as we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

Compliance with these requirements may require significant resources and management oversight to maintain and, if necessary, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating

39

results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which would increase our costs and expenses.

We are also required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent material misstatements due to fraud or error. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.

This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. Undetected or unremediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. We are required to disclose material changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis. We may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff.

We identified certain control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses in previous periods. From 2018 and throughout 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our reconciliation of funds held for customers. We remediated this material weakness in 2021. Starting in 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to an insufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training, and experience, including tenured experience at the Company, to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. As of March 31, 2024, we concluded that this material weakness, related to an insufficient complement of personnel, had also been remediated.

If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, including as a result of the material weakness described above, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq exchange.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

ITEM 1C. Cybersecurity.
We maintain a risk-based cybersecurity program, including various protections designed to safeguard against cyber attacks and manage material information and cybersecurity risks to address the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. This program includes:

•
the implementation of access controls, firewalls and virus detection software; 
•
the establishment (and periodic testing) of our disaster recovery plan, including protecting against business interruption by backing up our major systems;
•
periodic scans of our environment for vulnerabilities and 
engagement of third parties
 to perform penetration testing and assess effectiveness of our information security practices; and 
•
the maintenance of insurance that currently includes cybersecurity coverage. 
In the normal course of business, we also collect and store certain sensitive Company information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, customer information including bank account information and invoice and payment information, sensitive third-party information and employee information, and certain personal information. To protect this information and our systems, our existing cybersecurity protections include monitoring and detection programs and technical security measures. 
Additionally, we have processes in place that are designed to assess and manage cybersecurity risks associated with our use of higher-risk third-party service providers.
Governance—Board Oversight and Management’s Role in Assessing and Managing Cybersecurity Risks

Our board of directors and Chief Executive Officer have ultimate accountability for risk. This includes oversight of our risk management program, which includes risks from cybersecurity threats
.

Our 
board of directors and Chief Executive Officer, 

40

including 
through the risk management committee of our board of directors, provide oversight to ensure the appropriate measures are in place so that management can identify, assess, prioritize, and respond to risk, including cybersecurity risks.
 We believe our board of directors, the risk management committee of our board of directors, and our Chief Executive Officer collectively have the requisite experience, knowledge, inquisitiveness, and visibility into the design and operation of our information security practices to fulfill this responsibility effectively.

Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Cybersecurity Risks
At an operating level, our cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Officer ("CIO") and our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"). 
Our CIO has over 20 years of information technology experience that spans architecture and design, governance, disaster recovery, department development, and risk identification and remediation. In addition, our CISO has over 25 years of cybersecurity experience with a skill set that includes incident and remediation management, company-wide training, and the creation and implementation of cybersecurity compliance programs that address administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
.
Our cybersecurity program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information.

Our cybersecurity leadership regularly reports to the board of directors and its risk management committees on information security and cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, incident responses, and strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating potential threats.
 For example, the risk management committee in conjunction with management and our enterprise risk management team reviews and discusses cybersecurity metrics on a regular basis that include phishing incidents and training, vulnerability management, and security incident trends.
We have implemented policies, standards, and technical controls based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") framework with the aim of protecting our networks and applications, to safeguard the confidentiality of sensitive information entrusted to us. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the NIST as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.

Material Impacts from Cybersecurity Threats and Incidents
Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyber-attack will not occur. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.
In early April 2023, we detected a cybersecurity incident as part of our routine security monitoring protocols. In response to the incident, we undertook an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts, reached out to law enforcement, accelerated planned security enhancements, and have taken and will continue to take actions to implement additional safeguards.
The investigation determined that the incident primarily affected systems that were used for back-office activities. Data was exfiltrated from these systems and posted on the dark web. The data consisted of confidential information from our files, including personally identifiable information, primarily information of our employees, former employees, and their dependents, and the bank account information of some customers and other sensitive Company information. We cooperated with inquiries about the incident from three state consumer and financial service regulators, provided notices to impacted customers and individuals, and complied with regulatory requirements of various states that address notice and credit monitoring. We delivered all required notices during the fourth quarter of 2023 and consider our investigation to be complete.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024
, we incurred $
