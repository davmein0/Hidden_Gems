ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including commercial, intellectual property, employment, class action, whistleblower, and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material to our business or financial condition. The results of any future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

PART II.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Market Information for Common Stock

Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AVDX” since October 13, 2021. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock.

Holders of Record

As of February 24, 2025, we had 170 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders, as the number of record holders does not account for the number of stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.

Dividend Policy

We have not declared any cash dividends since becoming a public company and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and 
Note 10 "Long-term Debt" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 contained within this Annual Report. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our future financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, general business conditions, restrictions in our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and other relevant factors as determined by our board of directors.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered equity securities sold in the three months ended December 31, 2024:

•
On November 11, 2024, we transferred the fourth installment of 165,729 shares of common stock to a philanthropic partner, Foundation for the Carolinas and its affiliate Community Investments Foundation, as a charitable contribution in connection with an agreement between the parties dated October 1, 2021. Pursuant to this agreement we intend to provide annual ongoing grants of 10% of the pledged shares for a period of ten years, subject in each case to the approval of our board of directors.

The foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. Unless otherwise stated, the transfer of the above securities were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (and Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder) as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. The recipients of the securities represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed on the share certificates issued. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us. The transfer of these securities was made without any general solicitation or advertising.

Use of Proceeds

On October 12, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Reg. No. 333-259632), was declared effective in connection with the IPO of our common stock, pursuant to which we issued and sold 26,400,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The price per share to the public was $25.00. Gross proceeds from the IPO were $660.0 million and net proceeds, after deducting (i) underwriters’ discounts and commissions and (ii) offering expenses of $11.8 million, were approximately $608.6 million. Following the sale of these shares, the offering terminated. Shares of our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 13, 2021.

On October 15, 2021, we used $169.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem the shares of redeemable preferred stock issuable upon conversion of our senior preferred stock.

On November 15, 2021, the underwriters notified us of the partial exercise of the overallotment option. Upon closing on November 18, 2021, we issued 544,928 shares of common stock at the offering price of $25.00 per share and received net proceeds of $12.8 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions.

There have been no material changes in the planned use of proceeds from the IPO from those described in our Final Prospectus.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Company

43

In August 2024, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $100 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the "Share Repurchase Program"). Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The timing, price, and volume of the repurchases will be executed based on various market and legal factors, and subject to a $50 million cap in any fiscal year pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Share Repurchase Program will terminate upon the earlier of December 31, 2025 or the date on which the maximum dollar amount has been expended, but is subject to suspension, modification, or termination at any time at the Company's discretion.

 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risks discussed below and in our other SEC filings.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. A discussion of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Overview

AvidXchange was founded in 2000 to serve the AP automation needs of the middle market. In 2012, in response to customer demand for more efficient payment methods, we launched the AvidPay Network. We are now a leading provider of AP automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers. Our SaaS-based, end-to-end software and payment platform digitizes and automates the AP workflows for more than 8,500 businesses
(1)
 (our buyers) and we have made payments to more than 1,350,000 supplier customers of our buyers (suppliers) over the past five years. While acquiring new and retaining existing relationships with buyers and suppliers are important to our business, the growth of our business is ultimately dependent upon the number of transactions we process, as well as our total payment volume. We developed our technology platform through years of working to solve our buyers’ unique middle market workflow challenges. Leveraging our domain expertise, we purpose-built a two-sided network that connects buyers and suppliers, drives digital transformation, increases efficiency and accuracy in AP workflows, accelerates payments, enables insight into critical analytics, and lowers operating costs for our buyers.

Our platform was purpose-built for the middle market based on our desire to deal with the business process complexities of our initial customers. We believe we have become a strategic platform for our customers’ CFOs, treasurers and finance teams by digitally transforming how they receive, manage and pay their bills. Supported by integrations to our customers’ middle market-oriented accounting and information systems, our platform automates the end-to-end AP workflows for our buyers and enhances the payment experience for our suppliers. We provide a SaaS-based solution automating and digitizing the capture, review, approval and payment of invoices for our buyers. Our

two-sided payments network then connects our buyers with their suppliers, enabling invoice payments on behalf of a buyer and according to the supplier’s business rules, payment preferences and remittance data. We support a variety of payment methods depending on the supplier’s preference, including primarily VCC, enhanced ACH (our AvidPay Direct) and physical check, while delivering enhanced remittance data to streamline the reconciliation process. Finally, we provide cash management solutions to our supplier network that include tools that provide custom views of invoices and an accelerator feature (Payment Accelerator). These additional features, and others in our product pipeline, allow us to both monetize and increase engagement on our two-sided payments network.

Our customers operate across a variety of verticals in which we have domain expertise, including real estate, community association management, construction, financial services (including banks and credit unions), healthcare facilities, social services, education, hospitality, and media. Certain segments of our customers, particularly the customers we acquired through the FastPay acquisition that focus on political advertising within our media vertical, are subject to seasonal and cyclical trends. In 2024, we processed approximately 79 million transactions representing over $242 billion in spend under management across our platform and, of that, moved $84 billion in total payment volume from our buyers to their suppliers. Spend under management represents the sum of (i) the aggregate dollar amount of payments processed by us, plus (ii) the aggregate dollar amount represented by the total number of invoices processed by us, in each case, during the specified period. As described in more detail below, we generate revenue from each transaction processed on a per transaction basis and earn interchange revenue from a portion of the total payment volume.

(1)

Buyer customer number reflects the de-commissioning and exit of our legacy Create-a-Check (CAC) on-premise check printing software product as of the end of 2023. The associated base of CAC customers was approximately 1,400.

Our Business and Revenue Model

We sell our solutions through a hybrid go-to-market strategy that includes direct and indirect channels. Our direct sales force leverages their domain expertise in select verticals and over 290 referral relationships with integrated software providers, financial institutions and other partners to identify and attract buyers that would benefit from our AP software solutions and the AvidPay Network. Our indirect channel includes reseller partners and other strategic partnerships such as Mastercard, through

46

MasterCard’s B2B Hub, which includes Fifth Third Bank and Bank of America, and other financial institutions, such as KeyBank, and third-party software providers such as AppFolio, MRI Software, RealPage and Sage Software. Our referral and indirect channel partnerships provide us greater reach across the market to access a variety of buyers.

One of the ways that we evaluate our revenue model is by looking at our net transactions processed retention rate. We calculate the net transactions processed retention rate for a current period by dividing the (i) number of total transactions processed for customers in the comparable prior period into (ii) the number of total transactions processed for the same customers in the current period. Accordingly, the net transactions processed retention rate is calculated solely based on transactions of prior period customers in the current period, regardless of whether or not the prior period customer remains a customer in the current period. Correspondingly, customers in the current period that were not customers in the prior period are excluded from the current period calculation of the net transactions processed retention rate. Net transactions processed retention rate, together with our key metric Transactions Processed (as described below in the section titled “Key Financial and Business Metrics
”
), enables us to both assess transaction volume attributable to retained customers in a period as well as determine transaction volume attributable to new customers during the same period. This annual metric allows us to quantify the activity of retained customers over time and illustrates both retention and expansion of the volume of total transactions processed for such customers. Our net transactions processed retention rate from 2021 to 2022 was 103.5%, from 2022 to 2023 was 100.9%, and from 2023 to 2024 was 98.6%. We attribute the decline in transaction retention rate that we experienced from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024 primarily to macroeconomic factors, such as supply chain issues, price fluctuations and inflation that were impacting our customers. We generally expect retention rates to increase when macroeconomic factors improve. See our discussion of macroeconomic environment impacts below under Macroeconomic Environment's Impact of Revenue.

Our revenues are recurring in nature and are derived from multiple sources, predominantly through software revenue from our buyers and revenue from payments made to their suppliers. The table below represents our revenues disaggregated by type of service performed (in thousands):

Macroeconomic Environment's Impact of Revenue

Despite the resiliency exhibited by aspects of the United States economy during 2024, we believe that certain of our customers continued to exhibit caution in their purchasing decisions. More broadly, we believe that certain of the verticals or sub-components of those verticals in which we operate have been and continue to be more adversely impacted by the macroeconomic environment, which contrasts with the broader but measured improvement in overall economic sentiment. Tempered spending by existing customers and prospects impacts us two ways. First, tempered spending and a focus on costs can impact payment volumes, payment amounts, and payment type mix, particularly with respect to the acceptance rate of electronic forms of payment on our network that result in interchange revenue. The business metrics that best reflect these impacts include transaction yield and total payment volume. Second, cautious spending impacts sales and is reflected, in part, in our software revenue as well as the number of invoices and payments that we process. The business metrics that best reflect these impacts can be found in transactions processed as well as the number of buyers that we serve.

Looking forward, we expect the macroeconomic environment in 2025 will be affected by interest rates, inflation, and new federal policies on tariffs, immigration, taxes, deregulation, and fiscal sustainability. With respect to interest rates, when rates are lowered, interest income, which is a component of our payment revenue, is negatively impacted. Should the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in 2025, we would expect to experience negative impacts on our payment revenue and interest income. However, a lower interest rate environment could benefit certain segments of our buyer customers, such as those in certain segments of our real estate vertical, which could lead to increases in discretionary spending and transaction volume on our network.

With respect to inflation, the value of our customers' payments can increase in an inflationary environment, positively impacting our total payment volume and the base on which we earn interchange revenue. On the other hand, inflation can cause certain of our customers to moderate their expenditures and purchasing decisions, particularly discretionary spending, impacting the number of transactions processed across our network. Inflationary pressure can also negatively impact our operating costs by increasing costs incurred by us to operate our business, some of which we may not be able to recoup from our customers.

47

The impact of these macroeconomic conditions on payment volumes, payment amounts, and payment type mix, including the acceptance rate of electronic forms of payment on our network that result in interchange revenue, remains highly uncertain. A changing macroeconomic environment could also lead to difficulty in comparing our current consolidated financial results to our results in future reporting periods.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

Acquiring new buyers and suppliers

To sustain our growth, we need to continue to sell our AP software and payment solutions to new buyers. New buyers add software revenue and new buyers that use our payment solutions will allow us to continue adding new suppliers to our network, increasing payment volume across our platform and providing us with the opportunity to generate additional revenue from the payments our buyers make to their suppliers. Our financial performance will depend in large part on the overall demand for our platform particularly from middle market buyers and their suppliers.

Expanding our relationships with existing buyers and suppliers

The growth of our software revenue is dependent upon the number of invoice and payment transactions processed across our platform. The number of transactions that our buyers submit through our platform is often based on their experience implementing and using our products and services, realized or perceived value, and confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our services. Although we often include minimum transaction commitments in our buyer agreements, our growth is dependent on our buyers using our platform to process their invoice and payment transactions and otherwise serve their AP needs.

Payment revenue is a significant component of our overall revenue and is dependent upon the payment spend volume submitted by our buyers and processed through our AvidPay Network. Payment revenue is also dependent upon the continued acceptance by suppliers in our network of electronic payment types that result in interchange revenue and net interchange rates. Our growth will depend on our continued ability to deliver electronic payments to existing suppliers in a manner that is consistent with their internal business rules, payment preferences, and perceived value.

We also experience growth from buyers when we cross sell existing products and services or introduce new products and services.

Investing in sales and marketing

We continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to drive awareness and generate demand to acquire new buyers and to grow our supplier network. We also invest in new relationships with accounting software providers and other strategic partners. Our investments in supporting these relationships have been significant and will continue, and we expect such investments to include education and training initiatives such as webinars, industry trade show presentations, and developing sell-sheet case studies. We generally expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars while remaining fairly consistent as a percentage of revenue as we continue to expand our market presence, grow our customer base, and continue to develop new offerings to sell to our buyers and suppliers. We are focused on the efficient deployment of marketing resources to drive our sales efforts and expect to continue to increase marketing activities over the coming periods.

Growing our network

We will continue to add buyers and suppliers to our proprietary AvidPay Network and to invest in features and functionality to drive value across our network. We expect to expand payment methods on our platform over time.

Investing in our platform and products

We are making investments in our technology to maintain and enhance our position as a leading provider of AP automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers. To drive adoption and increase penetration within our base, we have and will continue to introduce new products and features. We believe that investment in research and development contributes to our long-term growth but may also negatively impact our short-term profitability. We continue to leverage emerging technologies and invest in the development of more features that meet and anticipate the needs of both buyers and suppliers. As a result, we generally expect our expenses related to research and development to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we are able to efficiently deploy our development resources against a larger revenue base. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources.

Pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions

Notwithstanding challenging market conditions that persisted throughout 2023 and 2024, which impacted the pool of potential opportunities, we will continue to seek to supplement our organic growth by pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand into new verticals and horizontal capabilities, capture unmonetized or under-monetized spend, and enhance and expand products and capabilities.

Key Financial and Business Metrics

We regularly review several financial and business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful

48

supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly-titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts or investors.

Transactions processed

We believe that transactions processed is an important measure of our business because it is a key indicator of the use by both buyers and suppliers of our solutions and our ability to generate revenue, since a majority of our revenue is generated based on transactions processed. We define transactions processed as the number of invoice transactions and payment transactions, such as invoices, purchase orders, checks, ACH payments and VCCs, processed through our platform during a particular period.

Transaction yield

We believe that transaction yield is an important measure of the value of our solutions to buyers and suppliers as we scale. We define transaction yield as the total revenue during a particular period divided by the total transactions processed during such period.

Total payment volume

We believe total payment volume is an important measure of our AvidPay Network business as it quantifies the demand for our payment services. We define total payment volume as the dollar sum of buyers’ AP payments paid to their suppliers through the AvidPay Network during a particular period.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

We generate revenue from the following sources: (i) software, (ii) payments, and (iii) services.

Software Revenue

We generate software revenue from our buyers primarily through (i) fees calculated based on the number of invoices and payment transactions processed and (ii) recurring maintenance and SaaS fees. Software revenue is typically billed to and paid by our buyers on a monthly basis. Our software offerings, many of which are built for specific verticals, address the needs of buyers and together they comprise our suite of predominately cloud-based solutions designed to manage invoices and automate the AP function. We generally sign multi-year contracts with buyers and revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. We also generally receive initial upfront implementation fees and software maintenance fees for ongoing support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable support period.

Payment Revenue

We generate revenue from the payments our buyers make to their suppliers through (i) offering electronic payment solutions to suppliers, (ii) fees charged to suppliers from our invoice Payment Accelerator product, and (iii) interest on funds held for buyers pending disbursement.

Our electronic payment solutions currently include primarily VCC and an enhanced ACH payment product, or AvidPay Direct, which eliminate paper checks and increase the speed of payment to the supplier. AvidPay Direct also provides suppliers with enhanced remittance data allowing the supplier to reconcile the payment and the underlying invoice. VCC revenues result from interchange fees applied to the spend processed and are recorded net of fees and incentives. AvidPay Direct revenue is based on a per transaction fee that we charge to suppliers that generally includes a cap and is based on the spend per payment and is recorded net of incentives.

Our invoice payment accelerator product, Payment Accelerator,

offers qualifying suppliers the opportunity to better manage cash flows and receive payments even faster by enabling these suppliers to receive advance payment on eligible invoices. Revenues are generated on a per transaction basis for each payment that is advanced. We currently fund the accelerated payment of invoices from our balance sheet.

Interest income represents interest received from buyer deposits held during the payment clearing process. We receive interest on funds held through our contractual relationship with our buyers, which we recognize as payment revenue. With respect to movements in interest rates, when rates are lowered, our payment revenue and interest income, resulting from the funds we hold

49

for buyers, are negatively impacted. Should the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in 2025, we would expect to experience negative impacts on our payment revenue and interest income. The rate we earn on buyer funds is difficult to predict in the short and long term and will continue to be impacted by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and any adjustments that are made in response to inflation.

Our media payments business includes customers that are involved in political advertising in the United States. Revenue from these customers is cyclical as it is connected to election advertising spend within the United States which tends to increase during significant election years, such as mid-term and presidential elections. We experienced growth in our media payments business in 2022 due to spending associated with the 2022 mid-term elections that did not reoccur in 2023.

While we experienced growth in our media payments business in connection with the United States’ 2024 presidential election, such growth was difficult to forecast and did not meet the expectations that we set at the beginning of 2024.

We utilize service providers to process a substantial portion of our payment revenue that is derived from interchange fees earned on payment transactions processed as VCCs. A large percentage of our revenue is processed by a small number of providers and our revenue is also dependent on the rates we are able to negotiate with these providers. See 
Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures regarding this concentration.

Services Revenue

Services revenue includes fees charged to process buyer change in service requests.

Total Revenue

We expect our total revenue to increase year over year due to an increase in the number of transactions processed, and the number of buyers and suppliers using the AvidPay Network, and that payment revenue should comprise a greater proportion of total revenue as the volume of transactions on the AvidPay Network continue to increase.

Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues includes personnel related costs, which include direct compensation, fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenues includes teams responsible for buyer and supplier onboarding and setup, invoice processing, payment operations, money movement execution, and customer service. Personnel costs also include internal labor associated with the employees who monitor the performance and reliability of our buyer and supplier solutions and the underlying delivery infrastructure (i.e., application and data hosting administration, product support and escalations, payment monitoring and settlement functions).

Cost of revenues also includes external expenses that are directly attributed to the processing of invoice and payment transactions. These expenses include the cost of scanning and indexing invoices, printing checks, postage for mailing checks, expenses for processing payments (ACH, check, and wires), bank fees associated with buyer deposits held during the payment clearing process, and other transaction execution costs. Additionally, cost of revenues includes fees paid to third parties for the use of their technology, data hosting services, customer relationship management tools used in the delivery of our services or in support of the delivery infrastructure, and adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible advancements processed through Payment Accelerator. Lastly, cost of revenues includes estimates for treasury losses that occur in treasury operations. Treasury losses include various unrecoverable internal payment processing errors that occur in the ordinary course of business, such as duplicate payments, overpayments, payments to the wrong party and reconciliation errors.

We have elected to exclude amortization expense of capitalized developed software and acquired technology, as well as allocations of fixed asset depreciation expense and facility expenses from cost of revenues.

Our long-term strategy to transition to public cloud services and decommission on-premise infrastructure hosted in co-located data centers was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2022.

We expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue to decrease as we continue to realize operational efficiencies and shift more of our transactions to electronic payments.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing consist primarily of costs related to our direct sales force and partner channels that are incurred in the process of setting up go-to-market strategies, generating leads, building brand awareness and acquiring new buyers and suppliers, including efforts to convert suppliers from paper check payments to electronic forms of payments and efforts to enroll them into the Payment Accelerator solution.

Personnel costs include salaries, wages, direct and amortized sales commissions, fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense. Most of the commissions paid to the direct sales force are incremental based upon

50

invoice and payment volume from the acquisition of a new buyer and are deferred and amortized ratably over an estimated benefit period of five years.

The partner ecosystem consists of reseller, referral and accounting system partners. Compensation paid to referral and accounting system partners in exchange for the referral and marketing efforts of the partner is classified as sales and marketing expense.

In addition, we focus on generating awareness of our platform and products through a variety of sponsorships, user conferences, trade shows, and integrated marketing campaigns. Costs associated with these efforts, including travel expenses, external consulting services, and various technology applications are included in sales and marketing as well.

While we are focused on efficient deployment of marketing resources, we expect to continue to increase marketing activities over the coming periods, and as a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to experience growth in absolute terms in the near term.

Research and Development

Research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and business intelligence tools or the enhancements of existing products and applications, as well as large scale infrastructure projects that improve the underlying architecture of our technology.

The main contributors of research and development costs are (i) personnel related expenses, including fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) fees for outsourced professional services. We capitalize certain internal and external development costs that are attributable to new products or new functionality of existing products and amortize such costs to depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years.

We also incur research and development costs attributable to the use of software tools and technologies required to facilitate our research and development activities. Examples of such costs include fees paid to third parties to host lower technical environments and the associated virtual machine ware fees paid to support agile development efforts, and fees paid for software tools and licenses used in quality control testing and code deployment activities.

We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we are able to efficiently deploy our development resources against a larger revenue base.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of our finance, human resources, legal and compliance, facilities, information technology, administration, and information security organizations. Significant cost contributors are (i) personnel expenses, including fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) costs of software applications, including end user computing solutions, and various technology tools utilized by these organizations. Occupancy expenses, which include personnel, rent, maintenance and property tax costs are not allocated to other components of the statements of operations and remain in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses are reduced by incentives we have received from state and local government agencies as part of various local job development investment grants.

General and administrative expenses include costs incurred from time to time related to events and transactions not directly attributable to operations. For example, during 2023 and 2024, general and administrative expenses include costs incurred in connection with a cybersecurity incident that was detected in April 2023 as well as insurance recoveries. Additionally, in both 2023 and 2022, general and administrative expenses also include restructuring costs incurred in connection with planned reductions of our workforce within the United States. Restructuring costs consist of one-time severance charges to be paid to affected employees. The plans were completed within their respective years. Also in 2022, general and administrative expenses included a benefit related to the resolution of a purchase accounting liability from the FastPay acquisition in 2021.

While we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the shorter term as we continue to build out our infrastructure to support our operations.

Impairment and Write-Off of Intangible Assets

Impairment and write-off of intangible assets is the reduction from carrying value to fair value for assets or asset groups whose carrying value is not recoverable and also includes charges determined based on our estimation of the amount of obsolescence of previously capitalized software development costs.

51

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of property and equipment over the estimated useful life of the applicable asset, as well as amortization of acquired intangibles (i.e., technology, customer list and tradename) with a useful life between 3 and 15 years, and amortization of capitalized software development costs with an estimated benefit of 3 years.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our bank borrowings and headquarters finance leases, offset by interest income on non-customer corporate funds.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

Income tax expense (benefit) consists of federal and state current and deferred income taxes.

The increase in revenues was largely comprised of an increase in payment revenue of $48.3 million, or 18.2%. This growth was driven primarily by increased electronic payments on the AvidPay Network due to the addition of new and existing buyer payment transaction volume, an increase in payment yield, that resulted, in part, from increased interest rates over the prior year period, and a $5.3 million increase in the payments associated with political advertising in connection with the presidential election cycle in 2024 compared to 2023, which was not a significant election year. Payment revenue and payment yield were positively impacted by interest on funds held for customers as the rate earned on those funds increased during the period compared to rates earned in the prior year period. Payment revenue from interest increased $9.1 million to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Software revenue increased by $9.0 million, or 8.0%, primarily driven by increased invoice and payment transaction volume from new and existing customers as well as increases in certain subscription-based revenue.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increases in employee costs of $5.2 million. The primary driver for the increase in employee costs relates to the shift in responsibility of certain teammates to increase utilization and adoption of our software. Additionally, amortization expense of deferred sales commissions increased $0.4 million and partner commissions increased $0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in consulting costs of $0.8 million as we discontinued services of certain vendors and a decrease in travel expense of $0.2 million.

Research and Development Expenses

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to costs associated with engaging consultants and contractors of $3.2 million and increases in employee costs of $1.0 million. Further, we experienced additional increases of $0.9 million in IT infrastructure and other costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.5 million attributable to an increase in the amount capitalized for software development costs.

General and Administrative Expenses

The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the cybersecurity incident that was detected in April 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an additional $0.4 million related to recoveries from cybersecurity insurance than the prior year period and we experienced a decrease in costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $5.1 million as the prior year period incurred a significant amount of expense associated with our initial threat response. Additional decreases included $1.4 million from a prior year period accrual related to a potential commercial dispute as well as a $0.7 million decrease in non-reoccurring restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by increases in IT infrastructure costs of $2.5 million and legal and professional fees of $0.4 million. We also incurred $1.1 million of costs from the write-off of debt issuance costs from renegotiating our credit facility and $0.9 million in impairment losses as a result of lease abandonments during the year ended December 31, 2024.

We do not expect additional recoveries or significant costs related to the cybersecurity incident will be incurred in future periods.

Impairment and Write-off of Intangible Assets

The impairment and write-off of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024 relates to internally developed software projects.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased in absolute terms primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with capitalized software development costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prior to the second quarter of 2024, we did not generate positive cash flow through our operations and we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of common and preferred stock and borrowings under our credit facilities, described below, and through our IPO that was completed in October 2021, which resulted in net proceeds of $621.4 million, including the exercise of the overallotment option and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $40.4 million and offering expenses of approximately $11.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity are our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $355.6 million, marketable securities of $33.7 million, and funds available under our revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which we entered into in August 2024 and replaced our former credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, our unused committed capacity under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was $150.0 million comprised of a revolving commitment.

We believe that our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and funds available under our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. To the extent existing cash, cash from operations, and amounts available for borrowing under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional capital. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional capital by the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Our ability to raise additional debt may be limited by applicable regulatory requirements as a licensed money transmitter that require us to meet certain net worth requirements. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our primary source of cash provided by our operating activities is from our software and payment revenue. Our primary uses of cash in our operating activities include payments of employee salaries and related costs, payments to third party service providers to execute our payment transactions, sales and marketing costs, and other general corporate expenditures.

54

Net cash provided by operating activities improved to $71.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 due primarily to an increase in revenue and an improvement from net loss to net income offset by changes in working capital, largely due to variations in timing of payment of accrued expenses.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash flows related to our investing activities consist primarily of the maturity and purchases of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, purchases of intangible assets, capitalization of internal-use software, and net supplier advances related to our Payment Accelerator product.

Net cash used in investing activities was $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $51.9 million provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by differences in the timing of purchases and maturities in our portfolio of held-to-maturity marketable securities.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash flows related to our financing activities consist primarily of changes in restricted buyer fund deposits related to buyer payment transactions, exercise of stock options, principal payments on financing leases, borrowings and repayments of long-term debt, and share repurchases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $440.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $290.8 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to variations in the inflows and outflows from payment service obligations of our customers as well as repayment of debt and share repurchases, both occurring in 2024.

Credit Facilities and Financial Debt Covenants

On August 8, 2024, we entered into an agreement to amend and restate our previous credit facility. As a result, we repaid the outstanding amount of the term loan and expanded the borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount available borrowing capacity under this agreement was $150.0 million, which may be increased, subject to specific conditions, by an additional amount (for all such increases) not to exceed $150.0 million, for a total aggregate amount of $300.0 million.

We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of December 31, 2024. Refer to 
Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about our credit facilities.

Land Promissory Notes

We have promissory notes in connection with land and improvements adjacent to our Charlotte, North Carolina headquarters campus. Refer to 
Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our promissory notes.

We are current with all payments under the notes.

Charitable Donation of Common Stock

On June 24, 2021, our board of directors approved the reservation of 1,657,296 shares of our common stock (representing approximately 1% of our issued and outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents as of June 24, 2021) for future issuance to fund our philanthropic endeavors, including possible issuance to a philanthropic partner in connection with the establishment of a donor-advised fund, over a ten-year period. Subject to approval by our board of directors, we make annual donations of 165,729 shares of common stock in connection with the ten-year pledge agreement. Refer to 
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about our issuances under the pledge agreement.

55

Share Repurchases

In August 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock ("the Share Repurchase Program"), subject to a $50.0 million cap in any fiscal year. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 5,357,388 shares of common stock for $50.1 million, which included $0.1 million of fees. Refer to 
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, $50.0 million remained available for future share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program.

Payment Obligations

We process payments for our customers. As part of our payment product offering, we have recorded payment service obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $1,250 million as of December 31, 2024 and an offsetting asset of restricted funds held for customers. This balance is short-term in nature and represents our obligation to pay our customers' suppliers as directed by our customers.

We historically transmitted buyer customer funds using a legacy trust model for processing payments, pursuant to which buyers’ funds were held in trust accounts that are maintained and operated by a trustee pending distribution. After buyers’ funds are deposited in a trust account, we initiate payment through external payment networks whereby the buyers’ funds are distributed from the trust to the appropriate supplier. We are not the trustee or beneficiary of the trusts which hold these buyer deposits, and accordingly, we do not record these assets and offsetting liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have largely transitioned away from the trust model although certain banks that resell our products and services continue to leverage a similar structure. The amount of buyer funds held in all trust-related accounts was $14.6 million and $6.3 million on December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.

Capitalization of internal-use software

We have significant expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development may result in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost per hour of full-time and temporary labor.

Deferred costs

Deferred costs include deferred sales commissions and implementations costs that are incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling buyer contracts. We amortize these costs ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with new buyers, which is generally five years. Based on historical experience, we determine the average life of our buyer relationship by taking into consideration our buyer contracts and the estimated technological life of our platform and related significant features.

Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and

56

liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.

We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.

Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which is generally 3 to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, or ASC 740. Under ASC 740, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets for the amount expected to be realized by considering all available positive and negative evidence.

Pursuant to ASC 740, we must consider all available positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets. ASC 740 provides for four sources of taxable income for realization of deferred tax assets: (i) taxable income in prior carryback years, (ii) reversals of future taxable temporary differences, (iii) tax planning strategies and (iv) projected future taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, we have no taxable income in prior carryback years, limited future reversals of taxable temporary differences and no prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The recoverability of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income.

We have maintained a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, having determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The determination of releasing the valuation allowance is made, in part, pursuant to our assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in making estimates of our ability to generate future taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, our forecasted future taxable income is not sufficient to support the future realization of the deferred tax assets, and our historical operations have produced significant losses.

The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are often ambiguous. Under ASC 740, the impact of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of (i) our operating cash and (ii) buyer funds. Our operating cash includes cash received from revenues generated, the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings. Buyer funds are funds that have been collected from buyers, but not yet remitted to the applicable supplier. The funds are held in either Company-owned accounts, which are subject to applicable state money transmitter laws, or in trust accounts. We are entitled to any interest earned on the investment of all buyer funds held in Company-owned accounts.

Our operating cash may be invested in accordance with our cash investment policy. Under that policy, we invest with the objective of preserving capital while optimizing yield. Permissible investments include United States Treasury instruments, United States Government Agency securities, Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, investment grade corporate bonds, and money market funds. As of December 31, 2024, we held marketable securities with an

57

amortized cost basis of $33.7 million and money market funds with an aggregate value of $72.7 million. The remaining amount operating cash was held in interest-bearing deposit accounts.

Assets consisting of our buyer funds are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income with emphasis on liquidity. Pursuant to our investment policy and subject to applicable law, buyer funds may be invested in United States Treasury securities, United States Government Agency securities, Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities, or other cash equivalents, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. As of December 31, 2024, all buyer funds, other than those held in trust accounts, have been invested in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts.

We are exposed to interest-rate risk relating to our investment portfolio, which consists principally of interest-bearing demand deposit accounts as well as investments made in accordance with our cash investment policy. We recognize interest earned from buyer funds assets as revenue. We generally do not pay interest to buyers. Factors that influence the rate of interest we earn include the short-term market interest rate environment and the weighting of balances by security type. The annualized interest rate earned on our investment of operating cash and funds held for buyers increased to 4.88% during the fiscal year 2024 from 4.39% during the fiscal year 2023.

Based on current investment practices, an increase in the Federal Funds interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed our interest income during the fiscal year 2024 from our investment of operating cash by approximately $3.5 million and our interest on buyer funds assets by approximately $11.2 million based upon the average balances for the fiscal year 2024 of $438.6 million in operating cash investments and $1,036.1 million in buyer funds investments, respectively. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect buyer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations that restricts the permissible investment alternatives for buyer funds may reduce our interest earned revenue.

Credit Risk

We may be exposed to credit risk in connection with our investments. Cash deposits may at times exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Company, or FDIC, limits. We limit credit risk by diversifying our portfolio, including a requirement that no more than 5% of invested funds may be held in the issues of a single corporation. Additionally, the minimum credit quality of any investment shall be not less than an ‘(A-) or (A3)’ rating equivalent from any single rating services based on ratings by any of Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, or Fitch Investor Services. The maximum maturity of any security in the portfolio shall not exceed 36 months. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio shall not exceed 12 months. In addition, maximum maturities of individual securities are further limited by the security type and cash segment of the investment. We are also exposed to credit risk related to the timing of payments made from buyer funds collected. We typically remit buyer funds to our buyers’ suppliers in advance of having good or confirmed funds collected from our buyers. Our buyers generally have three days to dispute transactions and if we remit funds in advance of receiving confirmation that no dispute was initiated by our buyer, then we could suffer a credit loss. We mitigate this credit exposure by leveraging our data assets to make credit underwriting decisions about whether to accelerate disbursements, managing exposure limits, and implementing various controls in our operating systems.

We are also exposed to risks associated with our Payment Accelerator product, in which our supplier customers can accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding invoices before our buyers initiate the transfer of funds. If those invoices are not approved or the buyer does not transfer the requisite funds then we are exposed to the risk of not being able to recoup our advances to the supplier. We mitigate this risk through data analytics to determine which invoices are available for advance payment and by also monitoring the credit quality of buyers and suppliers.

Liquidity Risk

As part of our buyer funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our buyers to satisfy other unrelated buyer funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a buyer available at the time the buyer’s obligation becomes due by collecting the buyer’s funds prior to payment of the buyer’s obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of buyer funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.

Concentration Risk

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from interchange fees earned on payment transactions. We utilize service providers to process these transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from two service providers individually represented more than 10% of total revenues. Refer to 
Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this concentration.

Future regulation or changes by the payment networks could have a substantial impact on our revenue from VCC transactions. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the payment networks, merchant/suppliers availing themselves of lower

58

rates, or future regulation, our total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially affected.

We are also exposed to concentration risk associated with buyer funds that we hold in Company-owned accounts, which are subject to applicable state money transmitter laws, and in trust accounts. As of December 31, 2024, all buyer funds, other than those held in trust accounts, have been invested in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. The majority of these demand accounts are maintained at one institution which is a full-service, FDIC-insured national bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is a subsidiary of a bank holding company subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. As indicated above, while we do not currently maintain private insurance to mitigate this risk, we seek to mitigate this risk by monitoring financial institutions that we conduct business with and endeavoring to maintain our cash balances at large well-capitalized financial institutions.

Inflation Risk

Inflationary factors, such as increases in the costs of doing business and the negative effects on the United States economy, may adversely affect our operating results. On the other hand, our revenue may be positively impacted by inflation and the interest we earn on funds held for buyers may increase. While overall inflationary trends were more favorable in 2024 than in 2023, the long-term impact of inflation and a changing interest rate environment on our business and on our buyers and suppliers in future periods remains highly uncertain, as does the Federal Reserve's response to these conditions.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria described in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report set forth in the F pages after Item 16 and the signatures of this Annual Report.

Limitations on Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Our management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements . Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or

F-
2

complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Restricted Funds Held for Customers and Payment Service Obligations

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, restricted funds held for customers and the corresponding liability of payment service obligations, which totaled $1,250.3 million as of December 31, 2024, represent funds that are collected from customers for payments to their suppliers. The Company determines restricted funds held for customers and the corresponding payment services obligations balances by reconciling cash held by financial institutions and corresponding payments in transit at the end of each period. The balance of these obligations may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the period end and the timing of when outstanding payments clear with financial institutions. The Company has obtained a money transmitter license in all states which require licensure. This model enables AvidXchange to provide commercial payment services to businesses through its “for the benefit of customer” (“FBO”) bank accounts that are restricted for such purposes. The restricted funds held for customers are restricted for the purpose of satisfying the customer’s supplier obligations and are not available for general business use by the Company. The Company maintains these funds in liquid cash accounts and contractually earns interest on these funds held for customers. These funds are recognized as a restricted cash asset and a corresponding liability is recorded for payments due to their suppliers on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, although the Company has largely phased out the model, it historically transmitted buyer customer funds using a legacy model pursuant to which buyer customer funds are held in trust accounts that are maintained and operated by a trustee pending distribution to suppliers in accordance with instructions provided through the Company’s platform. The Company is not the trustee or beneficiary of the trusts which hold these customer deposits; accordingly, the Company does not record these assets and offsetting liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company contractually earns interest on funds held for certain buyers. The amount of Company and bank customer funds held in all trust-related accounts was approximately $14.6 million as of December 31, 2024.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to restricted funds held for customers and payment service obligations is a critical audit matter are a high degree of audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of restricted funds for customers and the corresponding liability of payment service obligations.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to restricted funds held for customers and the corresponding liability of payment service obligations, specifically controls related to the matching of cleared payments and the reconciliation of outstanding payments. These procedures also included, among others (i) confirming the existence and accuracy of cash balances for all FBO and trust-related bank accounts and (ii) for the restricted funds held for customers and payment service obligations reconciliation as of December 31, 2024, (a) testing the mathematical accuracy; (b) testing the completeness and accuracy of the reconciling items, including outstanding payments; and (c) agreeing the balance per the reconciliation to the amounts recorded and disclosed in the financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

1.   Formation and Business of the Company
Formation
AvidXchange, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2000. In July 2021, the Company consummated a reorganization by interposing a holding company between AvidXchange, Inc. and its stockholders. After the reorganization, all of the stockholders of AvidXchange, Inc. became stockholders of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and AvidXchange, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. To accomplish the reorganization, the Company formed AvidXchange Holdings, Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2021, and AvidXchange Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. The Company merged AvidXchange, Inc. with and into Merger Sub, with AvidXchange, Inc. as the surviving entity, by issuing identical shares of stock of AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. to the stockholders of AvidXchange, Inc. in exchange for their equity interest in AvidXchange, Inc.
The merger was considered a transaction between entities under common control. Upon the effective date of the reorganization, July 9, 2021, AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. recognized the assets and liabilities of AvidXchange, Inc. at their carrying values within its financial statements.
AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “AvidXchange” or “the Company” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements after the reorganization.
Business
AvidXchange provides accounts payable (“AP”) automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers. The Company’s cloud-based, software and payment platform digitizes and automates the AP workflow for middle market businesses (AvidXchange’s “buyer” customers), and their service providers and vendors (AvidXchange’s “supplier” customers). The Company provides solutions and services throughout North America spanning multiple industries including real estate, community association management, construction, financial services (including banks and credit unions), healthcare facilities, social services, education, media, and hospitality.
AvidXchange’s software solutions are delivered primarily through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that connects buyer customers using the Company’s AP automation products with a network of their vendors, including supplier customers that have enrolled in AvidXchange’s electronic payments network (the “AvidPay Network”). This platform provides a multitude of solutions including electronic invoice capture, intelligent workflow routing, and automated payments, which can provide AvidXchange’s buyer and supplier customers with reduced costs, improved productivity, and reduction of paper from the traditional AP and payment processes.
The Company markets its solutions to buyers through both a direct salesforce and indirectly through strategic channel partnerships with banks and financial institutions as well as software and technology business partners. AvidXchange attracts buyer customers to the AvidPay Network through establishing a simple, easy-to-use network that helps integrate various buyers through a standard invoice and pay network. Supplier customers are selected to join the AvidPay Network by their buyer clients. The Company retains these supplier customers by helping them manage supplier payment preferences, forecast future cash flows, and for certain qualifying suppliers, accelerate invoices for early payment.
AvidXchange has completed strategic acquisitions that have expanded the customer relationships available to subscribe to its payment services solutions and gain access to new markets. The operating activities of the legal entities acquired are fully interdependent and integrated with the AvidXchange operations. The Company views its operations and manages its business as 
one
 segment and 
one
 reporting unit.
In January 2022, AvidXchange purchased a customer list and a non-compete agreement from PayClearly, a company in the media payments business. See Note 8 "Intangible Assets and Goodwill"
 for information regarding intangible assets.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and reflect the consolidated operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no items of comprehensive income.

F-

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Use of Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of and during the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements
 include, but are not limited to, the allowance for credit losses, useful lives assigned to fixed and intangible assets, capitalization of internal-use software, deferral of customer origination costs, the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the fair value of goodwill, and the recoverability of deferred income taxes. The Company assesses estimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Segments
The Company operates and manages its business as 
one
 reportable segment, which is the same as the operating segment as defined under FASB 
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280, 
Segment Reporting
. The segment's business operations, policies, and financial statements are fully aligned with those of the consolidated company that are included within the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of making decisions regarding allocating resources and assessing performance. All tangible assets are held in the United States and all revenue is generated in the United States. Refer to “Concentrations” below and Note 3 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" for additional entity-wide disclosures. There are no additional significant revenue or expense categories reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer other than those already presented on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. No additional reconciliations are necessary because all significant expense and revenue data aligns with the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Restructuring costs
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to generate cost savings and improve effectiveness of the organization which resulted in a reduction in the Company’s workforce within the United States. The plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023 and completed in the second quarter of 2024. The Company recorded restructuring costs of 
$
1,157
 and 
$
1,880
 during the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, from one-time severance charges in
 connection
 with this plan.

On September 21, 2022, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to generate cost savings and improve effectiveness of the organization which resulted in a reduction in the Company’s workforce within the United States. The plan was implemented and completed in the second half of 2022. The Company recorded restructuring costs of 
$
1,526
 in the second half of 2022 from one-time severance charges.

Restructuring costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Business Combinations
Identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed, resulting from a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. When a business combination involves contingent consideration, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in earnings in the period of the change. Shares of common stock issued as part of the purchase consideration are valued as of the date of the business combination.
Revenue Recognition
Refer to Note 3 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
 for information related to the Company’s revenue recognition.
Concentrations
Significant Services

A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue is derived from interchange fees earned on payment transactions processed as virtual commercial cards (“VCC”). The Company utilizes service providers to process these transactions. Revenue from one service provider represented

%
, 
15
%
, and 
24
%
 of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable from this service provider represented 
46
%
 and 
12
%
 of accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively
. 
Revenue from a 
second 
provider represe

second 
service provider represente

%
 of accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Future regulation or changes by the card brand payment networks could have a substantial impact on interchange rates and the Company’s revenue from VCC transactions. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the card brand payment networks or future regulation, or if merchant/suppliers elect to receive payments that result in lower or no interchange revenue such as check, or apply fees in consideration of accepting electronic forms of payment, the Company’s total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially affected. The Company's revenue from VCC transactions is also impacted by fees charged by service providers to process our VCC transactions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase that are not recorded as marketable securities to be cash equivalents. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Cash in the Company’s bank accounts may exceed federally insured limits.
Restricted Funds Held for Customers and Payment Service Obligations
Restricted funds held for customers and the corresponding liability of payment service obligations represent funds that are collected from customers for payments to their suppliers. The Company determines the balances of restricted funds held for customers, and the corresponding payment services obligations, by reconciling cash held by financial institutions and the corresponding payments in transit at the end of each period. The balance of these obligations may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the period end and the timing of when outstanding payments clear with financial institutions. The Company is registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Payment service obligations are comprised of outstanding daily transaction liabilities per state regulatory average daily transaction liability report requirements and other unregulated settlements with payees, which do not constitute a regulatory liability event under reporting requirements.
The Company historically transmitted buyer customer funds using a legacy model, pursuant to which buyer customer funds are held in trust accounts that are maintained and operated by a trustee pending distribution to suppliers in accordance with instructions provided through the Company's platform. The Company is not the trustee or beneficiary of the trusts which hold these buyer deposits; accordingly, the Company does not record these assets and offsetting liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has largely phased out this model, although certain banks that resell our products and services continue to leverage a similar structure. The Company contractually earns interest on funds held for certain buyers. The amount of Company and bank customer funds held in trust-related accounts was approximately 
$
14,618
 and 
$
6,269
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company has transitioned most payment transmission activity to the money transmitter license model and obtained a money transmitter license in all states which require licensure. This model enables AvidXchange to provide commercial payment services to businesses through its “for the benefit of customer” bank accounts, also known as FBO, that are restricted for such purposes. The restricted funds held for customers are restricted for the purpose of satisfying the customer’s supplier obligations and are not available for general business use by the Company. The Company maintains these funds in liquid cash accounts and contractually earns interest on these funds held for customers. These funds are recognized as a restricted cash asset and a corresponding liability is recorded for payments due to their suppliers on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted funds held for customers are included in the cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
.

Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of short-term investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, United States Treasury and agency bonds, and Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities. To reflect its intention, the Company classifies its marketable securities as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. As a result, the marketable securities are recorded at amortized cost and any gains or losses realized upon maturity are reported in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The marketable securities are subject to the expected credit loss model prescribed under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments
. The Company utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for held-to-maturity securities at the time of purchase. The Company measures the expected credit loss on its held-to-maturity portfolio on a collective basis by major security type. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses based upon historical default and recovery rates of bonds rated with the same rating as its portfolio and assessment of the expected impact from current economic conditions on its investments.

Accounts Receivable, Supplier Advances and Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable represent amounts due from the Company’s VCC service providers for interchange fees earned and from buyer customers who have been invoiced for the use of the Company’s software offerings, but for whom payments have not been received. Accounts receivable from VCC service providers are presented net of an allowance for returns for transactions subsequently canceled that do not ultimately settle through the payment network. Accounts receivable from buyer customers are presented net of allowances for credit losses and returns. The Company estimates expected credit losses related to accounts receivable balances based on a review of available and relevant information including current economic conditions, projected economic conditions, historical loss experience, account aging, and other factors that could affect collectability. Expected credit losses are determined individually or collectively depending on whether the accounts receivable balances share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for returns for VCC transactions subsequently canceled are assessed at each period end and recognized as a reduction of revenue. The allowances for buyer customer’s credit losses and returns are assessed at each period end and are recognized as bad debt expense within general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and as a reduction of revenue, respectively. A buyer customer receivable is written off against the allowance when it is determined that all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Historically, losses related to customer nonpayment have been immaterial and most of the accounts receivable balances have been current.
Supplier advances receivable represent amounts that have been advanced as part of the Payment Accelerator product but have not been collected. Advances are collected from the buyer customer once the buyer initiates the transfer of funds for the invoice that was previously advanced. If the buyer does not transfer the funds as expected, the Company is exposed to losses. The Company’s experience with such delinquencies by buyer customers has been immaterial. Supplier advances receivable are stated net of expected credit losses. The Company estimates expected credit losses related to supplier advances receivable balances based on a review of available and relevant information including current economic conditions, projected economic conditions, historical loss experience, account aging, and other factors that could affect collectability. Expected credit losses are determined individually or collectively depending on whether the accounts receivable balances share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses for supplier advances is assessed at period end and the measurement of the allowance is included as a component of cost of revenues in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Supplier advances receivable balances are charged against the allowance when the Company determines it is probable the receivable will not be recovered after collection efforts and legal actions have been exhausted. The Company classifies the fees charged to supplier customers as cash flows from operating activities with the remaining accelerated advancements and recoupments classified as cash flows from investing activities on a net basis within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition plus the cost of additions and improvements that increase the useful lives of assets. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from

three
 to 
seven years
, except for buildings which have estimated useful lives of up to 
35 
years
. Assets recorded under leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or related lease terms. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of assets sold or disposed are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses. The carrying value of all long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
. Assets under finance leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The amortization period is based on whether ownership transfers at the end of the lease, including the presence of a bargain purchase option. If ownership transfers or the Company has the option for a bargain purchase, the asset is depreciated over its useful life. If neither of the above criteria are present, the asset is depreciated over the life of the lease. Amortization of assets recorded as finance leases is included in the line item depreciation and amortization in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations
.
Leases
The Company accounts for leases under FASB ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
, and elected the following accounting policies and practical expedients related to this standard:
•
The options to not reassess prior conclusions related to the identification, classification, and accounting for initial direct costs for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2020;
•
Short-term lease accounting policy election allowing lessees to not recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less, and;
•
The option to combine non-lease components with their related lease components for all classes of underlying assets.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and the classification of the lease at inception. Due to the nature of AvidXchange’s operations, the Company has two main classes of underlying leased assets – i) information technology (“IT”) equipment and ii) corporate office space. IT equipment leases are classified as finance leases, whereas corporate office leases can be either operating or finance leases. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and current and noncurrent maturities of finance lease obligations on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred, or tenant incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are reflected in the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company, such as construction of significant leasehold improvements that are expected to have economic value when the option becomes exercisable.
In the calculation of the present value of the future minimum lease payments, AvidXchange uses either the implicit rate in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Practice has shown that an implicit rate is only determinable in the finance leases of IT equipment where the current price is readily available. For all office leases, the Company determines the net present value of future minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. AvidXchange’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated based on the Company’s credit rating, the yield curve for the respective lease terms, and the prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment. The same process is followed for any new leases at their commencement dates or modifications to existing leases that require remeasurement.
Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Amortization expense of the ROU asset for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term.
The Company evaluates ROU assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to abandon a leased facility prior to the end of the non-cancellable lease term or to sublease it for cash flows that do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease. The impairment evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows and if it indicates that the carrying amount of the ROU assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related ROU asset or asset group.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Company capitalizes costs related to the development of its software services and certain projects for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,
 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
. These capitalized costs are primarily related to the integrated invoice processing and payment solutions and services hosted by the Company and accessed by its customers on a subscription and transaction basis. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of Intangible assets, net. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally 
three years
.
Other identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired customer lists, technology and trade names, which were recorded at their fair values at the time of acquisition. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes, but is not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment as of October 31 of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company is comprised of a single reporting unit. The Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative assessment is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to employees and outside directors, including stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), is measured at fair value on the date of grant.
The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, while the fair value of RSUs is determined using the fair value of the Company’s underlying common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for RSUs with performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period on an accelerated-basis as long as the performance condition in the form of a specified liquidity event is probable to occur. In the case of equity issued in lieu of a cash bonus, expense is recognized in the period the cash bonus was earned.
Common Stock Repurchases
The Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware. Under the laws of that state, shares of its own common stock that are acquired by the Company, if any, constitute authorized but unissued shares. The cost of the acquisition by the Company of shares of its own stock in excess of the aggregate par value of the shares first reduces additional paid-in-capital, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied as an increase to accumulated deficit.
N
et Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, the weighted average number of potential shares of common stock. Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income (loss) per share for the holders of the Company’s common shares and participating securities, if any. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and participating preferred shares are allocated to each share on an as-converted basis as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. If the participating securities do not include a contractual obligation to share in losses of the Company, then they are not included in the calculation of net income (loss) per share in the periods in which a net income (loss) is recorded.

Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the more dilutive of (a) the two-class method or (b) the if-converted method. The Company allocates earnings first to preferred stockholders based on dividend rights and then to common and preferred stockholders based on ownership interests. The weighted average number of common shares included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) gives effect to all potentially dilutive common equivalent shares, including outstanding stock options and convertible preferred stock. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share if their effect is antidilutive. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is generally the same as basic net loss per share attributable t
o common stockholders since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Advertising Costs
Advertising and marketing costs are included in operating expenses and are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred advertising and marketing costs of approximately 
$
8,672
, 
$
8,606
 and 
$
8,310
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively.
Research and Development
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering and product development, including employee compensation and the costs of outside contractors.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax return consequences for those

F-
14

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

differences which will either be deductible or taxable when the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, are classified as noncurrent on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company evaluates both the positive and negative evidence that is relevant in assessing whether it will realize the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes all material tax positions, including uncertain tax positions, when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if challenged by the relevant tax authorities. All tax years since 2021 are open for potential examination by taxing authorities as of December 31, 2024
. However, tax authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses or tax credits were generated and carried forward. The tax authorities may make adjustments up to the amount of the net operating loss or credit carryforward. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
Retirement Plan
The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution plan. Under the plan, each employee meeting the minimum age requirement and with at least one month of service is eligible to participate. Benefits vest immediately. The Company matching contribution is 
100
 percent of the first 3 percent and 
50
 percent of the next 2 percent of compensation that a participant contributes to the plan. The Company made contributions of 
$
5,180
, 
$
5,025
 and 
$
4,817
 to the plan, net of forfeitures, for eligible and participating employees for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively. Contributions are subject to certain IRS limitations.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company adopted a nonqualified, deferred compensation plan effective October 1, 2015, which is an unfunded plan created for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. The purpose of the plan is to attract and retain key employees by providing them with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation. It is exempt from the participation, vesting, funding, and fiduciary requirements set forth in Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Deferred amounts are not subject to forfeiture and are deemed invested among investment funds offered under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, as directed by each participant.
The Company has established a ‘rabbi trust’ that serves as an investment to shadow the deferred compensation plan liability. The assets of the rabbi trust primarily consist of trust-owned life insurance policies which are recorded at cash surrender value and are included in other noncurrent assets. The change in cash surrender value of the life insurance policies in the rabbi trust is recorded in other income (expense) on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The assets of the rabbi trust are general assets of the Company and as such, would be subject to the claims of creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The related deferred compensation liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities.
The Company has recorded these assets and liabilities at their fair value. In association with this plan, 
$
2,756
 and 
$
1,866
 were included in other noncurrent assets and 
$
2,393
 and 
$
2,398
 were included in noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets
.
Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities require significant judgment in estimating potential losses for legal claims. We review significant new claims and litigation for the probability of an adverse outcome. Estimates are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators, and the estimated loss can change materially as individual claims develop.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and supplier advances receivables, assets of the rabbi trust, AP, deferred compensation liabilities, and debt. The carrying amount of cash, trade and supplier advances receivables, and AP approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value which is based on estimated borrowing rates currently available to the Company for similar debt issues. Marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost.

F-

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
The following is a brief description of those three levels:

Level 1

Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active market and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

When more than one level of input is used to determine the fair value, the financial instrument is classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 according to the lowest level input that has a significant impact on the fair value measurement. The Company performs a review of the fair value hierarchy classification on an annual basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or financial liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.

3.   Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identify the contract with a customer;
•
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determine the transaction price;

F-
16

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

•
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue Sources
The Company’s revenues are derived from multiple sources. The following is a description of principal revenue generating activities.
Software Revenue
Software revenue is tailored specifically to the Company’s buyer customers and include AvidInvoice, AvidPay, AvidUtility, AvidBill, Avid for NetSuite, Strongroom Payables Lockbox, ASCEND and TimberScan. These various offerings address the specific needs of buyers and together they comprise the Company’s suite of cloud-based solutions designed to manage invoices and automate the AP function. Revenues are derived from mostly long-term contracts with middle-market customers. The vast majority of the revenues are comprised of 1) fees calculated based on number of invoice and payment transactions processed, 2) recurring maintenance or subscription fees, or 3) some combination thereof. Fees for the Company’s services are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis. The Company’s core performance obligation is to stand ready to provide holistic AP management services and process as many invoices and/or payments as the buyer customer requests on a daily basis over the contact term. The unspecified quantity of the service meets the criteria for variable consideration, where the variability is resolved daily as the services are performed. Accordingly, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single-series performance obligation and revenue is recognized based on the services performed each day.
Included in software revenue is software maintenance and subscription fee revenue, which is recognized ratably ov
er the term of the applicable service period, generally 
12 months
 for Avid for NetSuite and TimberScan customers, and generally 
60 months
 for ASCEND customers.
In addition, each contract contains the promise of providing implementation services for an upfront fee. In determining whether the implementation services are distinct from the hosting services, the Company considered various factors, including the level of customization, complexity of integration, the interdependency and interrelationships between the implementation services and the hosting services and the ability (or inability) of the customer’s personnel or other service providers to perform the services. The Company concluded that the implementation services are not distinct and therefore fees for implementation services are combined with the main promise of the contract and recognized ratably over the non-cancellable term of the contract.
Software offerings are also sold to end customers through reseller partners. The Company evaluated whether it is the principal or the agent in these arrangements. The reseller partners directly contract with the end customers and are ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of the services. The Company may have some discretion in determining the fee charged to the end customer, but always in conjunction with the reseller partner. Therefore, in most reseller partner arrangements, the Company acts as an agent and performs the services as directed by and on behalf of the reseller partner and recognizes revenue on a net basis in the amount to which it expects to be entitled, excluding the revenue share earned by the reseller partner.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.
Payment Revenue
Payment revenue includes (i) interchange fees earned on payment transactions processed as VCC, (ii) fees from supplier product offerings, and (iii) interest on funds held for buyers pending disbursement.
With respect to interchange fees, the Company evaluated whether it is the principal or the agent in the arrangement and determined that interchange fees are not received in return or exchange for services that the Company controls or acts as the principal, and the Company does not play any role or have control over how the interchange basis points are established. Therefore, the Company acts as an agent and records interchange fees net of i) fees charged by the VCC processor and ii) rebates provided to AvidXchange’s buyer customers, reseller partners and supplier customers as an incentive to increase the volume of VCC transactions. The rebates to buyer customers are for cash consideration, which includes cash payments or credits that may be applied against trade accounts owed by the customer to the Company. The rebates to supplier customers are also for cash consideration in the form of reimbursement of processing fees related to the acceptance of payments via a VCC. The Company recognizes monthly net interchange fees based on the transactional volume issued by the VCC processor and submitted to the suppliers, less a reserve for transactions subsequently canceled.
Product offerings which address the needs of AvidXchange’s fast-growing network of suppliers currently include AvidPay Direct (“APD”) and Payment Accelerator. The APD service eliminates paper checks and provides suppliers with the opportunity to

F-
17

AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

receive electronic payments with enhanced remittance data. Payment Accelerator is an open-end credit program that offers certain qualifying suppliers the opportunity to better manage cash flows and receive payments by enabling these suppliers to receive advance payment on eligible invoices. Revenues are generated on a per transaction basis for each payment that is advanced and/or processed using APD. The per transaction fee includes both a fixed and a variable component based on the spend per payment. There are currently no other monthly, annual, or start up fees associated with the supplier contract. Given that the underlying fees are based on unknown services to be performed over the contract term, the total consideration is determined to be variable. The variable consideration is usage-based and therefore, it specifically relates to the Company’s efforts to satisfy its obligation to the supplier. The variability is satisfied each time a service is provided to the supplier and the variable fees are recognized at the time of service.
Payment revenue also includes interest income received from buyer customer deposits held during the payment clearing process. Such funds are deposited in Company owned accounts, or to a lesser extent, trust accounts that are maintained and operated by a trustee.
Services Revenue
Services revenue is derived from the sale of professional services that are distinct and are recognized at the point in time the benefit transfers to the customer.

Contract Assets and Liabilities
The Company’s rights to payments are not conditional on any factors other than the passage of time, and as such, AvidXchange does not have any contract assets. Contract liabilities consist primarily of advance cash receipts for services (deferred revenue) and are recognized as revenue when the services are provided.

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. These revenues are subject to future economic risks including customer cancellations, bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.
The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606, paragraph 606-10-50-14(b) and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations related to transaction and processing services that qualify for recognition in accordance with paragraph 606-10-55-18 ASC 606. These contracts contain variable consideration for stand-ready performance obligations for which the exact quantity and mix of transactions to be processed are contingent upon the buyer or supplier request. These contracts also contain fixed fees and non-refundable upfront fees; however, these amounts are not considered material to total consolidated revenue.
The Company’s remaining performance obligation consists of contracts with financial institutions who are using the ASCEND solution. These contracts generally have a duration of 
two
 to 
five years
 and contain fixed maintenance fees that are considered fixed price guarantees. 
Remaining performance obligation consisted of the following:

Contract Costs

The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract, as well as costs to fulfill a contract with buyer customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions incurred if a contract is obtained, and customer implementation related costs.
The Company utilizes a portfolio approach when estimating the amortization of contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. These costs are amortized on a 
straight-line basis
 over the expected benefit period of generally
 five years
, 
which was determined by taking into consideration customer attrition rates, estimated terms of customer relationships, useful lives of technology, industry peers, and other factors. The amortization of contract fulfillment costs associated with implementation activities are recorded as cost of revenues while the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for

Money market funds are classified as cash equivalents in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash, with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, the Company’s cash equivalent money market funds have carrying values that approximate fair value.

(2)

Fair value of insurance policies represents their cash surrender value based on the underlying investments in the account which is determined based on quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in active markets.

6.   Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, United States Treasury and agency debt, and Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities and are classified as held-to-maturity. Investments held in marketable securities had
 contractual maturities of less than 
one year
 as of December 31, 2024. As the Company invests in short-term and high credit quality marketable securities, the Company expects to receive fixed par value without any loss of principle at the maturity of each security. Therefore, an allowance for expected credit losses is not recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Impairment Losses and Write-offs
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made the decision to vacate certain office leases, effective December 31, 2024. The Company assessed the recoverability of the leased spaces and concluded that as the spaces could not be subleased, they had no further economic benefit to the Company and were deemed to be abandoned. The Company recognized 
$
945
 in impairment losses as a result of these lease abandonments and 
$
50
 in connection with one ROU asset write-down. As a result of the lease abandonment, the Company recorded a one-time gain of 
$
48
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 from the remeasurement of the lease liability and no ROU assets remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized impairment losses and write-offs of 
$
2,700
 in connection with two ROU assets in general and administrative expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company assessed the recoverability of leased space adjacent to its headquarters campus and concluded that as the space could not be subleased, it had no further economic benefit to the Company and was deemed to be abandoned. In addition, the Company vacated part of its leased office space in Sandy, Utah and listed it for sublease. As a result, a portion of the carrying value of the lease was determined not to be recoverable and an impairment loss and write-off was recognized in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations

On August 8, 2024, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AvidXchange, Inc. and AFV Commerce, Inc. (the "Borrowers"), entered into a credit agreement (the "2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank") to amend and restate in its entirety its previous senior secured credit facility (as amended, the "2022 Credit Agreement"), dated as of December 29, 2022. The Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement upon closing the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
 has a term of 
five years
 and consists of 
$
150,000

5-year
 revolving credit facility (the "2024 Revolver").
Under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and subject to specific conditions, the Company may request, and the lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to increase the 2024 Revolver or add an additional term loan facility by an additional amount (for all such increases) not to exceed 
$

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

The maturity date for the 2024 Revolver is 
August 8, 2029
. Interest only payments are required during the term, with the outstanding principal balance due in full upon maturity. Interest is payable quarterly. The Company may voluntarily pre-pay all or any part of the 2024 Revolver along with accrued interest and any applicable breakage costs, without premium or penalty.
Interest on the loans under the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
is equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"), term SOFR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is between 
2.0
% and 
2.5
% for daily simple SOFR and term SOFR loans (plus a SOFR adjustment of 
0.1
%), and between 
1.0
% and 
1.5
% for base rate loans. The applicable margin fluctuates based on a leverage ratio that reflects the Company's consolidated funded indebtedness to the Company's consolidated EBITDA. The Company may elect one-, three- or six-month interest periods in connection with term SOFR. The base rate is equal to the higher of KeyBank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.5
%, or 
one-month
 term SOFR plus 
1.0
%. For purposes of the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, daily simple SOFR, term SOFR and the base rate will never be less than 
0.5
%.
The 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants require the Company to provide the lenders with certain financial statements, budgets, compliance certificates and other documents and reports and to comply with certain laws. The negative covenants restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens on its assets, make certain investments, dispose of its assets or engage in a merger or other similar transaction or engage in transactions with affiliates, which are subject, in each case, to the various exceptions and conditions described in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The negative covenants further restrict the Company’s ability to make certain restricted payments, including the payment of dividends 
in certain circumstances and repurchase of common equity in excess of $
50,000
 shares in any fiscal year.
The 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
also contains several financial covenants, measured on a consolidated basis. First, during the period commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 through June 30, 2025, (a) there must be liquidity (which is defined as availability under the 2024 Revolver, plus unrestricted cash) that is more than the greater of (1) $
35,000
 and (2) 
35
% of the Revolving Amount, as defined in the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, (b) as of the end of each such quarter, total revenue on a trailing four-quarter basis must be greater than the requirements set forth in the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, and (c) for each period of four consecutive quarters, consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, must not be less than $
10,000
. Second, during the period commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025 until maturity, (i) the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, must not exceed 
3.00
 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter and (ii) the Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
, must not be less than 
3.00
 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Leverage Ratio must not exceed 
3.50
 to 1.00 during certain periods following an acquisition of a certain size. 
The Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants as of 
December 31, 2024
.
The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also includes certain customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders are entitled to take various actions, including the charging of a default rate of interest, accelerating the maturity of all loans and taking all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor with respect to the collateral for the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and under applicable law.
The obligations under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by:
•
substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its material subsidiaries, except for existing real estate, client funds, client funds accounts, and other excluded accounts (as such terms are defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), and
•
the capital stock of the Company’s material subsidiaries.
Under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, AvidXchange, Inc. and AFV Commerce, Inc., are the only borrowers, and AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of AvidXchange, Inc. and AFV Commerce, Inc. are co-guarantors.
Revolving Credit Facility
There was 
no
 balance outstanding under the 2024 Revolver as of 
December 31, 2024
. The Company is required to pay on a quarterly basis a commitment fee between 
0.25
% and 
0.3
% per annum as determined by the Leverage Ratio, with respect to the amount of the 2024 Revolver during the term of the agreement.
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs incurred with entering into the 
2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
 were deferred and amortized over the 
five-year
 term of the agreement. Of the remaining deferred costs associated with the 2022 Credit Agreement,

12.   Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Plans
Upon the closing its IPO on October 15, 2021, the Company's 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2021 Plan") became effective. Initially, the 2021 Plan increased the number of shares of common stock available for the Company to issue by 
18,023,020
 shares and incorporated the outstanding awards under its prior plans. 
No
 new awards will be granted under the Company's prior plans. Initially, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan will not exceed 
26,013,196
 shares of common stock, which includes the new shares provided by the 2021 Plan and any shares of common stock subject to outstanding options or other awards under its prior plans.
Beginning on January 1, 2022 and continuing through January 1, 2031, the number of shares of common stock that will be reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year. The increase will be the lesser of (i) 
5
% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding year or (ii) 
18,023,020
 shares, provided that before the date of any such increase, the Company's board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). The maximum number of shares of common stock that ma
y be issued on the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2021 Plan is 
26,013,196
 shares. On January 1, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available to issue under the 2021 Plan increased by 
10,204,201
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
26,149,571
 shares of common stock allocated to the 2021 Plan but not issued or subject to outstanding awards.
The Company also maintains its 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), under which eligible employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Options to purchase shares are granted twice a year on or about November 1 and May 1 and are exercisable on or about the succeeding April 30 and October 31, respectively, of each year. Shares are purchased at prices equal to 
85
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the lower of the grant date or purchase date. No participant may purchase more than $
25
 worth of the Company’s common stock in a year. The ESPP's initial purchase period began in January 2022.
Initially, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP was 
2,703,452
 when it became effective upon the consummation of the Company’s initial public offering. The number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of each year for a period of up to ten years, beginning on January 1, 2022 and continuing through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding year or (ii) 
2,703,452
 shares, provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). Shares issuable pursuant to the ESPP may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired shares of our common stock. On January 1, 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP increased by 
2,040,840
. As of December 31, 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was 
7,761,285
.

Stock Options
Stock options granted under the Company's current and prior equity incentive plans have various vesting periods ranging from fully-vested on the date of grant to vesting over a period of 
three
 or 
four years
. The term for each incentive stock option under these plans is 
ten years
 from the grant date, or 
five years
 for a grant to a ten percent owner optionee, in each case assuming continued employment. The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

$
5,685
, 
$
1,570
, and 
$
1,448
, respectively. The Company provides a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset and therefore did not recognize a tax benefit for stock option exercises in either of the years presented. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 
$
4,455
, 
$
1,874
, and 
$
2,074
, respectively. The intrinsic value was calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock at exercise and the exercise price of the in-the-money options.
The fair value of stock-based awards granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions:

Due to limited historical data, the Company estimates stock price volatility based on the actual historical volatility of comparable publicly traded companies over the expected term of the option. The expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding. Prior to the IPO, expected term of the award was calculated on the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual term, which is in accordance with the simplified method. The expected term of options granted after the IPO was determined based on historical data. The expected term for share-based compensation granted to nonemployees is the contractual term. The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve during the expected term of the option. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs have a vesting period generally of between 
one
 and 
four years
. Any unvested RSUs are forfeited upon termination of employment. RSUs are valued based on the trading price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. RSUs granted prior to the Company's IPO are valued at the estimated value of a share of common stock at the date of grant.

13.   Commitments and Contingencies

Resolution of Loss Contingency
During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company paid approximately 
$
1,400
 related to a commercial dispute. The amount recorded is net of recoveries. The amount was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2023
. There were 
no
 additional amounts accrued or any additional insurance recoveries recorded during the 
year ended December 31, 2024 and the Company considers this dispute resolved.
Cybersecurity Incident
In early April 2023, the Company detected a cybersecurity incident as part of its routine security monitoring protocols.
 In response to the incident, the Company launched an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts, reached out to law enforcement, accelerated planned security enhancements, and has taken and will continue to take actions to implement additional safeguards.

The investigation determined that the incident primarily affected systems that were used for back-office activities. Data was exfiltrated from these systems and posted on the dark web. The data consisted of confidential information from the Company's files, including personally identifiable information, primarily information of Company employees, former employees, and their dependents, and the bank account information of some customers. The Company cooperated with inquiries about the incident from three state consumer and financial service regulators, provided notices to impacted customers and individuals, and complied with regulatory requirements of various states that address notice and credit monitoring. The Company completed its investigation of this cybersecurity incident in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Expenses Incurred
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of 
$
302
 and 
$
5,433
, respectively, in response to the incident, including professional services and legal fees, before insurance recoveries.

Insurance Coverage
The Company maintains cyber insurance coverage and has tendered claims for certain expenses incurred in connection with this event. The extent to which the Company's insurance will cover such expenses was substantially complete as of June 30, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded recoveries in the amounts of 
$
2,110
 and 
$
1,735
, respectively. Insurance recoveries are recorded as a reduction of general and administrative expense. As a result of the Company’s cybersecurity incident in 2023, the Company’s cyber insurance premiums increased significantly following renewal, and the number of insurers that submitted proposals for consideration during the Company’s renewal process was very limited.

As required by ASC 740, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.
