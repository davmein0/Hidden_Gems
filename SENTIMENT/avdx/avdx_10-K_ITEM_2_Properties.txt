ITEM 2. Properties.

We lease our approximately 201,000 square foot built to suit corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina pursuant to a lease with an initial term that expires in 2032. In 2021, we purchased approximately 60,000 square feet of office space that we use as flex space to support our operations and additional real estate parcels that are adjacent to our corporate headquarters. We own approximately 17.1 acres of land adjacent to our current headquarters for future expansion.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we undertook an effort to reduce our office footprint outside of our headquarters and we abandoned our leased offices in Framingham, Massachusetts, Sandy, Utah, Houston, Texas, and Birmingham, Alabama. We continue to maintain and support our employee-teammate concentrations in these areas.
