Item 1. Business
General
PriceSmart was founded in 1996 by Sol and Robert Price, the creators of Price Club, the original warehouse club operator. The mission of PriceSmart is to operate its warehouse club business in Central America, the Caribbean and South America at operating standards as good as, or superior to, warehouse club operations in the United States.
As of August 31, 
2025
, we had 
56
 warehouse clubs in operation in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. In addition, we are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we believe is a promising new market for our business model. We believe PriceSmart has become one of the most respected and trusted brands in the countries where we operate and with over 
two million 
membership accounts, and almost 
four

million
 cardholders, we believe PriceSmart is an essential part of the shopping experience for consumers and small businesses in PriceSmart’s markets.
PriceSmart sources approximately half of its merchandise from suppliers within Latin America and the Caribbean, with the balance of merchandise sourced throughout the rest of the world. Product selection includes basic consumable merchandise for consumers and businesses, 
“

” 
private label merchandise and consumable and non-consumable products that are often not otherwise available in our markets.
PriceSmart continually focuses on innovation. In recent years, PriceSmart has added optical, audiology, and pharmacy services in many of its locations. Beyond in-club shopping, our Members can shop via our mobile app or online at PriceSmart.com, both of which offer home delivery and curbside pickup via its Click & Go® service. PriceSmart is making significant investments in technology to both improve the digital shopping experience for its Members and to enhance operating efficiencies in its supply chain and the back office.
We seek to be an outstanding place to work and provide safe and pleasant working environments for our over 12,000 employees, along with excellent pay and benefits, including healthcare coverage and retirement benefits. 
PriceSmart is committed to improving the quality of life for people living in the communities in which it does business. In partnership with Price Philanthropies Foundation, PriceSmart provides school supplies to approximately 140,000 children, and eye exams to thousands of children through the Aprender y Crecer program. In addition, the PriceSmart Foundation makes grants to support youth workforce development and small business growth in PriceSmart markets.
We believe that operating our business at the highest standards, providing outstanding jobs for our employees and being good stewards of the communities in which we operate result in PriceSmart being a good investment for our stockholders.

In July 2025, the Company announced its plans to expand into Chile. 
Our member-facing warehouse clubs are all located in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our distribution centers, including two regional distribution centers, which are located in the United States (Miami) and Costa Rica, operate in conjunction with our local distribution centers in all of our multi-club markets throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and support service center offices are located 
i
n the United States. Lastly, we have additional support service centers in some of our markets. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. 
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we purchased land for our sixth warehouse club in the Dominican Republic, located in La Romana, approximately 73 miles east from the nearest club in the capital of Santo Domingo. The club will be built on a five-acre property and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2026. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we purchased land for our third warehouse club in Jamaica, located in Montego Bay, approximately 100 miles west from the nearest club in the capital of Kingston. The club will be built on a five-acre property and is anticipated to open in the summer of 2026.
Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we executed a land lease for our fourth warehouse club in Jamaica, located on South Camp Road, approximately six miles southeast from the nearest club in the capital of Kingston. The club will be built on a three-acre property and is anticipated to open in the fall of 2026.
Once these three new clubs are open, we will operate 59 warehouse clubs in total. 
We continue to pursue opportunities to add new warehouse clubs in our existing markets and to assess opportunities in new markets. We are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we have identified as a potential market for multiple PriceSmart warehouse clubs. As part of this initiative, we have appointed a country general manager and entered into an executory agreement for a potential site for a new warehouse club in Chile. We have hired local consultants to help us in this process. However, opening PriceSmart warehouse clubs in Chile remains subject to our finding appropriate sites for warehouse clubs and distribution facilities, the results of our continuing market analyses and the receipt of required governmental permits, among other uncertainties.
We also historically exported products to a retailer in the Philippines, but effective August 31, 2024, our business relationship with that retailer ceased, except for $11.9 million of outstanding merchandise orders fulfilled during fiscal year 2025. We recently began exporting to a retailer in the Bahamas and may export to other countries if opportunities that complement our business model arise.

Merchandising

A fundamental part of our value proposition is making available to our retail and business Members a selection of high-quality merchandise and services sourced within our region and from around the world, at lower prices than our competitors.
We offer merchandise and services in the following categories:
•
Consumables, consisting primarily of groceries, cleaning supplies, and health and beauty aids, representing approximately 47% of our net merchandise sales;
•
Fresh Foods, including meat, produce, deli, seafood and poultry, representing approximately 31% of our net merchandise sales; 
•
Hardlines, including electronics, large and small appliances, automotive, hardware, sporting goods, and seasonal products, representing approximately 11% of our net merchandise sales; 
•
Softlines, including clothing, domestics and home furnishing products, representing approximately 6% of our net merchandise sales;
•
Food Service and Bakery, representing approximately 4% of our net merchandise sales; and 
•
Health Services, including optical, audiology and pharmacy, representing approximately 1% of our net merchandise sales.
Competitive Strengths
Low Operating Costs
. Our club format is designed to move merchandise from suppliers to PriceSmart Members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution by minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also have opened distribution centers in all of our multi-club markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rate, reduce lead times on high volume products, and mitigate risks of supply chain disruption. Our focus on lowering operating costs helps us provide better value and lower prices to our Members, which we believe helps generate Member loyalty and renewals, which in turn leads to increased sales. 
Membership.
 Our membership provides a competitive advantage. Membership targets a desirable demographic with strong purchasing power. Data we can access about our Members not only provides better connectivity with our Members, but also enables us to identify and pursue additional opportunities to provide value for our Members. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry, beginning over 49 years ago at Price Club, the first membership warehouse club business. We believe membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership fees contribute to our ability to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers. Membership fees were equal to approximately 1.7% of net merchandise sales and 36.8% of operating income in fiscal year 2025. Our Members can sign up for and renew their memberships online, which gives us another valuable digital touch point with them.
We continue to expand our product and services offerings to our Members. One of our primary initiatives is the expansion of our wellness services, which include our optical, pharmacy and audiology departments. As of August 31, 2025, we had 55 optical locations, 22 pharmacies and 30 audiology locations open. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to enhance the value of our membership further in various areas. We continue to explore opportunities to provide our Members with products and services that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base.
Business Members.
 Our product selection, larger pack sizes, and low prices appeal to both business and retail consumers. Business Members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions, and other businesses that purchase products for resale and supplies used in their businesses. These Business Members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.
Worldwide Sourcing.

Approximately 49% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and Europe. We believe one of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our local competitors is our buying team, based both in the United States and in our markets, which sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world. Our buyers identify and purchase new and exciting items, including our own “
Member’s Selection
®
” private label products. Many of these products are available only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate.

Continuous Improvement.
 The warehouse club industry has been operating for over 49 years, following the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has evolved during this period, particularly with respect to how technology impacts operational efficiencies and how consumers shop. We are leveraging technology to enhance our buying process to more efficiently source merchandise and procure products in a manner that meets current and ever-evolving member preferences. We operate in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, distribution and logistical challenges and Member preferences that require us to source the correct mix of local and imported merchandise. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future Members. We also have improved our inbound and outbound online communication channels, and we are using data analytics to better understand our Members’ evolving preferences. 
Growth
As we look to the future, our Company is focused on three major drivers of growth:
•
Invest in Adding New PriceSmart Locations, Expanding into New Markets, Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs and Opening More Distribution Centers
•
Increase Membership Value
•
Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Digital and Technological Capabilities
I.
Invest in Adding New PriceSmart Locations, Expanding into New Markets, Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs and Opening More Distribution Centers. 
We continue to pursue opportunities to add new warehouse clubs in our existing markets and to assess opportunities in new markets. We have acquired land for two new warehouse clubs and entered into a land lease for a third new warehouse club. These warehouse clubs will be our sixth warehouse club in the Dominican Republic and our third and fourth warehouse clubs in Jamaica. Once these three new clubs are open, PriceSmart will operate 59 warehouse clubs in total. In addition to continued growth throughout our current markets, we are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we have identified as a potential market for multiple PriceSmart warehouse clubs. As part of this initiative, we have hired local consultants to assist us, appointed a country general manager, entered into an executory agreement for a potential site for a new warehouse club in Chile and are actively reviewing other potential sites. Additionally, we believe that one of the quickest and most effective ways to increase sales and profitability is to increase the size and efficiency of our existing warehouse clubs and the number of parking spaces at our high-volume locations. To support this strategy, we will begin warehouse club and parking lot expansions and remodels in fiscal year 2026 at select clubs. During fiscal year 2024, we entered into a lease agreement to relocate and extend the lease term for our Miraflores club, which is our highest selling location in Guatemala. The new warehouse will have increased sales floor square footage and a greater number of parking spaces, along with covered parking for our Members. We expect to relocate our Miraflores club to this new location in the first half of calendar year 2027. We are enhancing our distribution and logistics network through the opening of distribution centers in China and in each of our multi-club markets, either operated by PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We anticipate full implementation of these distribution centers in China in the first half of fiscal year 2026. We expect to reduce landed costs and lead times (via direct shipments from Asia to our local markets) and improve our working capital as a result. In addition to our regional distribution center in Costa Rica, we have PriceSmart-operated distribution centers in various stages of development and implementation in other key markets. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we adapted our distribution center in Panama to handle cold merchandise and began operation of a new dry distribution center in Guatemala. In fiscal year 2026, we plan to open PriceSmart-run distribution centers in Trinidad and Dominican Republic.

Increase Membership Value.
 At PriceSmart, we are dedicated to attracting new Members and fostering long-term loyalty by continually enhancing the value of membership. In addition to providing low prices on merchandise, we seek to provide Members with greater convenience and an expanding range of services. This includes access to PriceSmart.com for online shopping, seamless club pickup and delivery services, and our comprehensive Well-being initiative. Members enjoy optical services with free eye exams, affordably priced eyeglass frames, audiology services with hearing tests, and competitively priced hearing aids. In select markets, pharmacy services further enrich the PriceSmart membership experience. We increased the membership fee by $5 in all but one market during fiscal year 2024 and may consider further adjustments as member benefits and value continue to grow. A larger membership base and higher membership fee contribute to the bottom line of the business or can be reinvested in providing better pricing to our Members. We focus on growth of our membership base, Member renewal rates and average ticket as part of determining how Members see the value we offer. A key driver of our membership strategy is the Platinum Membership, which is designed to offer even more value to our most engaged Members. Platinum Members enjoy exclusive benefits, including an annual cashback reward on eligible purchases, which directly translates to savings that reward loyalty and increase purchasing power. By offering tangible financial rewards, we believe Members can derive maximum value from their membership, particularly when paired with the PriceSmart co-branded credit card which offers an additional cash back incentive for Members with the card. Platinum Members tend to demonstrate higher renewal rates and increased spending compared to other membership tiers. Platinum Membership accounts were 17.9% of our total membership base as of August 31, 2025, an increase from 12.3% as of August 31, 2024. Additionally, our private-label products that we sell under the Member’s Selection
®
 brand plays a crucial role in enhancing the membership value proposition. We believe these products, available only at PriceSmart, deliver superior value while maintaining the high standards that our Members expect. Sourced with care and designed to meet daily needs, Member’s Selection
®
 products range from pantry staples to household essentials, providing affordable alternatives without compromising on quality. In fiscal year 2025, our private label sales represented 28.1% of total merchandise sales, up from 27.6% for fiscal year 2024, and we plan to continue to invest in the development of additional private label products under the “
Member’s Selection
®
” brand. By continuously enhancing our benefits and maintaining a strong focus on membership growth, renewal rates, and Member spending, we provide our Members with unmatched value, no matter how, when or where they choose to shop. As PriceSmart continues to grow, we look forward to reinvesting in new benefits and services that enhance the Member experience, creating a mutually beneficial relationship built on trust, value, and innovation.
III.
Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Digital and Technological Capabilities
. 
We’ve continued to tailor our digital experience to try to exceed our Members expectations of how, when and where they want to shop. In fiscal year 2025, our digital channel sales reached $306.7 million, a 21.6% increase year-over-year, representing 6.0% of total net merchandise sales. We’re also modernizing our processes and technology. For example, we made substantial progress in our migration to the RELEX platform in fiscal year 2025, and we expect to complete our implementation in fiscal year 2026. We believe this upgrade enhances employee productivity and is designed to improve inventory management, reduce spoilage and increase in-stock availability, driving both sales and efficiency. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect to finalize implementing a new point-of-sale system, Elera, a Toshiba product, in all of our English-speaking markets in the Caribbean, and in fiscal year 2026 we will begin implementation in our Spanish speaking Central American markets. We believe with Elera we can achieve faster checkout times, improve employee productivity and enhance our payment option capabilities. Lastly, during fiscal year 2026, we will begin migrating our mobile application to fully native iOS and Android architectures to enhance speed, reliability, and accessibility for our Members. We believe this will shorten the release cycles and deepen integration with our composable commerce stack. Solidifying our foundation and allowing for faster deployment of new features will help us achieve our mission of delivery of an outstanding shopping experience while leveraging costs down.
Distribution Efficiency

We have always believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our traditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online. Because PriceSmart sources merchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries where infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as developed as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more significant for us. Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our Members is key to the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we can price our products for our Members.

Historically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have generally shipped their products to our Miami distribution facility, which operates within a Free Trade Zone, where the products are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our locations. Regional and in-country suppliers have shipped directly to our locations. As our location sales volumes have grown, we have routed more products from international, regional and local suppliers to regional and local distribution centers in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply, reduce logistics costs and improve working capital. 
In addition to our Miami distribution facility, we have a large regional distribution center located in the metropolitan area of San Jose, Costa Rica. This 165,000 square foot facility distributes both dry and refrigerated products primarily to PriceSmart clubs in Costa Rica and also ships some products to other clubs in Central America. In Panama City, Panama we have an approximately 120,000 square foot leased building that serves as a distribution center for our warehouse clubs in Panama. This distribution center operates in a similar way to our distribution center in Costa Rica. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we adapted our distribution center in Panama to handle cold merchandise and began operations of a dry distribution center in Guatemala. In fiscal year 2026, we plan to open PriceSmart operated distribution centers in Trinidad and Dominican Republic. In the majority of our markets, we use distribution centers run by a third party. These distribution centers are part of our strategy to streamline a portion of our logistics network and, together with our plans to implement origin consolidation, we believe we will be able to lower freight costs, reduce transit time, and improve working capital by accelerating our sales conversion cycle. In addition, we are enhancing our distribution and logistics network through the opening of distribution centers in China and in each of our multi-club markets, either operated by PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We anticipate full implementation of our distribution center in China starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.   
PriceSmart's Membership Policy
We offer three types of memberships: Diamond, Business and Platinum.
The Diamond Membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond Membership (entitling Members to two cards), in most markets as of August 31, 2025 was approximately $40 (excluding tax).
The Company currently offers the Platinum Membership program in all thirteen of its markets, which entitles Members to two cards. The annual fee for a Platinum Membership in most markets is approximately $80 (excluding tax). The Platinum Membership provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500. Platinum Members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period. The rebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31. Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue.
We promote our Business and Business Platinum Memberships by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. In most markets, our Business Members pay an annual membership fee of approximately $40, or approximately $80 for Business Platinum, for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 or $15 for additional add-on membership cards based on membership type. Only businesses can qualify for a Business Membership, which permits up to three additional members.
Members can sign-up and renew their memberships as well as choose auto-renewal online.
We recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership. Deferred membership income was $41.7 million and $36.2 million as of August 31, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Our membership agreements provide that if our Members cancel their membership in the first 60 days, they will receive a full refund. After the initial 60-day period, Members may receive a refund for the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.
Our Intellectual Property Rights
It is our policy to obtain appropriate intellectual property rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We also rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know-how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation.

Our Competition
Our international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, shopping convenience and the overall shopping experience we offer. Some of our competitors have greater resources, buying power and name recognition. In the countries in which we operate and in Chile, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, cash and carry outlets, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart, Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito in Colombia and Cencosud in South America. We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format. It is possible that additional warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with a similar warehouse club format. We also face competition from online retailers, such as AmazonGlobal and Mercado Libre in South America, and last-mile delivery services that serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future. Lastly, we face competition from wholesalers selling food and/or general merchandise, which more directly competes with our business-to-business sales.

Human Capital
As of August 31, 2025, we had over 12,000 employees. Approximately 96% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and about 1,750 employees were represented by labor unions.
Developing a Diverse Workforce Representative of Our Markets
At the heart of our mission is the conviction that our success depends on people, their talent, their diversity, and their ability to thrive. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce that reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of the countries in which we operate. By drawing talent from local communities where we operate, we not only create meaningful opportunities, but also gain deeper insight into each country’s operating environment and legal framework which we believe allows us to serve our Members with even greater relevance and impact.
We are a “People First Company”, and we believe our employees are our greatest strength. We believe we provide our employees with competitive wages paired with comprehensive benefits programs that often include health and life insurance, as well as long-term savings and retirement plans. These offerings strengthen financial security and well-being for our employees and their families.
Our commitment extends beyond our workforce. We believe volunteering opportunities help build camaraderie and promote teamwork. We actively seek opportunities to support local businesses and contribute to the vitality of the communities around us. In doing so, we aim to elevate the quality of life where we operate, ensuring that our presence creates lasting, positive impact—economically, socially, and environmentally. During fiscal year 2025, our teams achieved almost 12,000 hours of volunteering, having surpassed our goal of 8,000 hours. Our volunteer engagements consisted of various programs that reflected a strong focus on education and community support activities such as back-to-school programs, book delivery programs, and cleaning activities such as beach, park, and river clean-ups in our communities. Our teams also invested significant time in working with children and youth programs, vision programs, and food bank support. These various programs highlight a strong alignment with education, environmental care, and community well-being as the primary areas of volunteer impact.
Talent Development and Learning
Our commitment to developing human capital goes beyond formal training programs. We focus on creating career paths that empower employees at all levels to see and achieve long-term growth within PriceSmart. By investing in internal mobility and succession planning, we believe we foster a culture of opportunity and advancement, ensuring continuity and resilience in our leadership pipeline. In fiscal year 2025, we conducted more than 2,100 corporate talent development sessions, including general leadership training. We provided specialized training to over 2,500 employees on developing a “Member-centric mindset,” along with courses on emotional intelligence and overcoming unconscious bias. Additionally, we offer a wide range of courses in technical and language skills, as well as wellness programs, including more than 3,900 meditation sessions through the Calm App, which is provided to our employees at no cost. We also delivered valuable “life tools,” such as workplace suicide prevention, women’s wellbeing and menopause, neurodiversity awareness, self-awareness, and fostering a growth mindset within teams, with over 5,000 total participant engagements throughout the year.
We also recognize that fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace is critical to sustaining innovation and engagement. Our goal is to ensure that every employee has equal access to the resources and opportunities needed to thrive.
Importantly, we believe that employee well-being serves as the foundation for performance. Beyond competitive compensation and benefits, our wellness initiatives encompass physical and mental health resources, financial well-being programs, and family support services, reinforcing our holistic approach to caring for our people. By creating a positive, supportive environment, we believe we enable our teams to bring their full potential to work each day, which ultimately strengthens the value we deliver to our Members.
Through these investments in our people, including training, career growth, wellbeing, and inclusion, we believe we are laying the groundwork for sustained organizational excellence. We believe our human capital strategy not only drives operational efficiency and service quality but also deepens employee engagement and loyalty, positioning PriceSmart for long-term success.

Engaging Our Team through Internal Events – Diversity & Inclusion
Each month, we organize a variety of activities in the countries in which we operate, including celebrating birthdays and work anniversaries, volunteering, recognizing employees, health and wellness events, and recreational activities like Sports Day and 5K runs. We also send company-wide messages to highlight events that honor diversity and cultural heritage and to educate team members about their history and importance.
We also recognize the role of communication and transparency in employee engagement. Regular town halls in every country, leadership forums, and digital communications serve both to celebrate company milestones and to provide forums for employees to voice their ideas and perspectives. These exchanges not only strengthen the sense of community across our geographically dispersed teams but also enable leadership to remain closely connected to employee experiences on the ground.
The activities we facilitate do more than bring employees together. They create platforms for celebrating our diversity, enriching our experiences, and fueling our shared journey toward success. In addition to promoting knowledge sharing, we believe they empower our employees to grow personally and professionally, fostering an inclusive environment where we celebrate unique perspectives and strengthen our organizational culture.
In addition to these engagement activities, in fiscal year 2025, we launched the program “Women@PSMT” to support the advancement of women in their careers. We had eight chapters consisting of different topics, over 100 sessions, and almost 9,000 total participant engagements from November to August. This program plays an important role in raising awareness, promoting inclusive practices, and ensuring that our female employees feel seen, heard, and valued. Through these efforts, we aim to foster a culture of respect and equity, where every individual can bring their authentic self to work and contribute fully to our mission.
We believe that strong engagement is directly linked to performance, innovation, and retention. By creating inclusive opportunities for connection—whether through cultural celebrations, professional development forums, or wellness activities—we believe we foster collaboration and ensure that our employees feel meaningfully connected to both one another and to the company’s long-term vision.
Looking ahead, we will continue to expand these initiatives in line with our broader human capital and environmental and social responsibility strategies. Our goal is to cultivate an organizational culture that celebrates diversity, encourages engagement, supports overall well-being, and ensures every employee has the opportunity to thrive and develop at PriceSmart. In doing so, we believe we not only strengthen our workforce but also enhance the value we provide to our Members and local communities.
Seasonality
Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable.  Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.
