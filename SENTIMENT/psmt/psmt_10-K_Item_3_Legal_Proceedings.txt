Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
In September 2022, the Company issued restricted stock awards (RSAs) and performance stock units (PSUs) covering 156,225 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. The RSAs and PSUs were issued from the pool of shares available for issuance under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan, as amended. The securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions not involving any public offering. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions are accredited investors, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about the Company. Resale of these shares by the holders has since been registered under the Securities Act.
