The Company purchased land located in La Romana, Dominican Republic, where we plan to open our sixth warehouse club in Dominican Republic in the spring of 2026.

The Company purchased land located in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and leased land located on South Camp Road, Jamaica, where we plan to open our third and fourth warehouse clubs in Jamaica in the summer and fall of 2026, respectively. 
Although we have entered into real estate leases in the past and will likely do so in the future, our current preference is to own rather than lease real estate. We lease land and, in some cases, land and buildings when appropriate sites within market areas are not available to purchase. The terms on these leases for our warehouse clubs generally run for 20 to 30 years and contain options to renew from 5 to 20 years. We actively seek to secure lease extensions or find suitable replacement properties before our leases expire. We have successfully negotiated extensions in the past and believe we will continue to be able to do so in the future; however, each lease renewal is subject to its own facts and circumstances, so we cannot be sure that we will be able to renew each lease on economically favorable terms. For instance, we've recently entered into a lease agreement to relocate our Miraflores, Guatemala club, for which the current lease was due to expire on December 31, 2025, to a new location adjacent to the current club location. We expect to relocate our Miraflores club to this new location in the second half of calendar year 2026. We expect minimal impact to the continuity of our operations for this club. Refer to Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details on our Miraflores club relocation.
As of August 31, 2025, sales floors of the Company’s warehouse club buildings occupied a total of approximately 2,732,467 square feet, of which 441,461 square feet were on leased property. 
We operate two large regional distribution centers, one in Miami, Florida and the other in San Jose, Costa Rica, along with several smaller local distribution centers for the consolidation and distribution of merchandise shipments to our warehouse clubs. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, and we maintain other regional offices in the Miami distribution facility and our international locations. We own our regional dry merchandise distribution facility in Miami, Florida, but we otherwise lease most non-warehouse club facilities and expect to continue to lease these types of facilities as we expand. Our leases for non-warehouse club facilities typically provide for initial lease terms between five and 30 years, with options to extend. We believe this leasing strategy for non-warehouse club facilities enhances our flexibility to pursue expansion opportunities when the needs of our business require. As current leases expire, we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals, if desired, for these present locations, or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area.
