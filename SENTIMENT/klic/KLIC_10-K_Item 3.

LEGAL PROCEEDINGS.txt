MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “KLIC.” Based on data provided by The Depository Trust Company, on November 11, 2024, the management believes that there were approximately 290 holders of record of the shares of outstanding common stock, as defined by Rule 12g5-1 of the Exchange Act. 
On August 26, 2024, May 16, 2024, March 14, 2024 and November 15, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend $0.20 per share of common stock, resulting in an aggregate dividend of $0.80 per share of common stock for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that such dividends are in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders.
For the purpose of calculating the aggregate market value of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates, as shown on the cover page of this Annual Report, we have assumed all of our outstanding shares were held by non-affiliates except for shares held by our directors and executive officers. However, this does not necessarily mean that all directors and executive officers of the Company are, in fact, affiliates of the Company, or there are no other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company. Further information concerning the beneficial ownership of our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders will be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program to $200 million, $300 million and $400 million respectively. On March 3, 2022, the Board of Directors further increased the share repurchase authorization under the Company’s existing share repurchase program by an additional $400 million to $800 million, and extended its duration through August 1, 2025. The Company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. On May 7, 2022, the Company entered into a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act to facilitate repurchases under the Program. This trading plan was most recently modified on May 29, 2023. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and will be funded using the Company’s available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the Program depend on market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations.
