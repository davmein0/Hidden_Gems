Results of Operations

Overview

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives.  Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver
 the 
Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify its organizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks.  The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage.  For 2024, total revenue increased 11.4%, and noninterest expense increased 2.8%, as compared to the previous year.  The Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet.  For 2024, net interest income increased $80.8 million, or 8.8%, as compared to the previous year. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets, coupled with higher interest rates.  This increase was partially offset by higher interest-bearing deposit rates.  Average earning assets increased $3.3 billion, or 8.9%, compared to 2023.  Average loan balances increased $1.9 billion, coupled with an increase in average interest-bearing due from banks of $1.4 billion from the prior year.  The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 19.4% increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 37.4% decrease in average borrowed funds and a decrease of 5.3% in noninterest-bearing deposits.  Net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis, decreased one basis point compared to the same period in 2023 in large part due to repricing and mix changes of interest-bearing liabilities with the changes in short-term interest rates, partially offset by the repricing of earning assets.  Net interest spread contracted by three basis points during the same period.

The third financial objective is to grow the Company’s revenue from noninterest sources.  The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth.  Noninterest income increased $86.3 million, or 15.9%, to $628.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was driven by increased trust and securities processing income, other miscellaneous income, investment securities gains, net, and bankcard income.  These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, noninterest income represented 38.6% of total revenues, as compared to 37.1% for 2023.

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management.  The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company’s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.21% and $3.5 billion in total shareholders’ equity, an increase of $366.1 million, or 11.8%, compared to total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2023.  The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during 2024 except for shares acquired pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. In 2024, the Company declared $77.1 million in dividends, which represents a 2.4% increase compared to dividends declared during 2023.

Earnings Summary

The Company recorded consolidated net income of $441.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.  This represents a 26.1% increase over 2023.  Net income for 2023 was $350.0 million, or a decrease of 18.9% compared to 2022.  Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $9.05 per share compared to $7.22 per share in 2023, an increase of 25.3%.  Basic earnings per share were $8.93 per share in 2022, or a decrease of 19.1% from 2022 to 2023. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 25.2% from 2023 to 2024 and decreased 19.0% from 2022 to 2023.  Return on average assets and return on average common shareholder’s equity

38

for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 1.02% and 13.24%, respectively, compared to 0.88% and 12.23%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Return on average assets and return on average common shareholder’s equity for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1.15% and 15.83%, respectively.

The Company’s net interest income increased to $1.0 billion in 2024 compared to $920.1 million in 2023 and $913.8 million in 2022.  In total, net interest income increased $80.8 million, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by a favorable volume variance of $88.5 million, offset by a $7.7 million rate variance.  See Table 2.  The favorable volume variance on earning assets was predominantly driven by an increase of $3.3 billion, or 8.9%, in average earning assets.  In 2024, average loan balances increased $1.9 billion, coupled with an increase in average interest-bearing due from banks of $1.4 billion as compared to 2023.  Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased to 2.51% for 2024, compared to 2.52% for the same period in 2023, driven by repricing and mix changes of interest-bearing liabilities with the changes in short-term interest rates, partially offset by the repricing of earning assets.  Net interest spread contracted by three basis points during the same period.  The Company has seen a small increase in the benefit from interest-free funds as compared to 2023 driven by the changes in short-term interest rates. The impact of this benefit increased two basis points compared to 2023 and is illustrated on Table 3.  The magnitude and duration of this impact will be largely dependent upon the FRB’s policy decisions and market movements. See Table 21 in Item 7A for an illustration of the impact of an interest rate increase or decrease on net interest income as of December 31, 2024.

The provision for credit losses totaled $61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is an increase of $19.8 million, or 48.1%, compared to the same period in 2023.  This change is driven by impacts of loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior period. See further discussion in “Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses” in this report.

The Company had an increase of $86.3 million, or 15.9%, in noninterest income in 2024, as compared to 2023, and a decrease of $12.4 million, or 2.2%, in 2023, compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 is primarily driven by increased trust and securities processing of $33.4 million, increased other income of $14.1 million, increased investment securities gains, net of $13.9 million, and increased bankcard fees of $13.1 million.  The decrease in 2023 is primarily driven by decreased investment securities gains, net of $61.6 million, partially offset by an increase in trust and securities processing of $20.0 million and other income of $21.0 million.  The change in noninterest income in 2024 from 2023, and 2023 from 2022 is illustrated in Table 6.

Noninterest expense increased in 2024 by $27.5 million, or 2.8%, compared to 2023 and increased by $101.0 million, or 11.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 is primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefit expense of $40.5 million, increased legal and consulting fees of $16.2 million, increased processing fees of $14.8 million, and increased bankcard expense of $11.3 million, partially offset by decreased regulatory fees of $45.1 million related to the FDIC special assessment.  The increase in 2023 is primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment of $52.8 million, and increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and processing fees.  The increase in noninterest expense in 2024 from 2023, and 2023 from 2022 is illustrated in Table 7 and below under Noninterest Expense.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company’s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities.  The volume of interest earning-assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the interest rates paid on each affect net interest income.  Table 2 summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Net interest margin, presented in Table 1, is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets.  Net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to adjust for the tax-exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments, which are primarily obligations of state and local governments.  A critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-free sources.  Table 3 analyzes net interest margin for the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Net interest income, average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years 2022 through 2024 are presented in Table 1 below.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates.

RATE-VOLUME ANALYSIS 
(in thousands)

This analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average interest rates for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The change in net interest income that is due to both volume and interest rate has been allocated to volume and interest rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.  All interest rates are presented on a tax-equivalent basis and give effect to tax-exempt interest income net of the disallowance of interest expense for federal income tax purposes, related to certain tax-free assets.  The loan average balances and rates include nonaccrual loans.

The Company experienced an increase in net interest income of $80.8 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023.  This follows an increase of $6.3 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022.  Average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $3.3 billion, or 8.9%, compared to the same period in 2023.  Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.51% for 2024 compared to 2.52% in 2023.

The Company funds a significant portion of its balance sheet with noninterest-bearing demand deposits.  Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 31.6%, 33.9% and 40.6% of total outstanding deposits as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in 2024 is driven by the increase in short-term interest rates. As illustrated in Table 3, the impact from these interest-free funds was 117 basis points in 2024, as compared to 115 basis points in 2023 and 43 basis points in 2022.

The Company experienced an increase in net interest income during 2024 due to a volume variance of $88.5 million, offset by a negative rate variance of $7.7 million.  The average rate on earning assets during 2024 increased by 41 basis points, while the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 44 basis points, resulting in a three basis-point decrease in spread.  The volume of loans increased from an average of $22.3 billion in 2023 to an average of $24.2 billion in 2024, driven by organic loan growth.  The volume of interest-bearing liabilities increased from $25.6 billion in 2023 to $29.0 billion in 2024.  The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints.  These changing economic conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company in 2025.  Loan-related earning assets tend to generate a higher spread than those earned in the Company’s investment portfolio.  By design, the Company’s investment portfolio is moderate in duration and liquid in its composition of assets.

During 2025, approximately $1.5 billion of available-for-sale securities are expected to have principal repayments.  This includes approximately $317 million that will have principal repayments during the first quarter of 2025.  The available-for-sale investment portfolio had an average life of 56.0 months, 52.6 months, and 62.3 months as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL represents management’s judgment of total expected losses included in the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  The Company’s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company’s lifetime historical loss experience, management’s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management’s recorded ACL.  To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses 
(ASC 326).  The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company’s available-for-sale debt security portfolio.  Assets held at amortized cost include the Company’s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio.

43

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans.  These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics.  This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement.  This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered.

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company’s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis.  If the Company’s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s).  Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses.

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

Table 4 presents the components of the allowance by loan portfolio segment.  The Company manages the ACL against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore, the allocation of the ACL to a particular loan segment may change in the future.  Management of the Company believes the present ACL is adequate considering the Company’s loss experience, delinquency trends and current economic conditions.  Future economic conditions and borrowers’ ability to meet their obligations, however, are uncertainties which could affect the Company’s ACL and/or need to change its current level of provision.  For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table 5 presents a summary of the Company’s ACL for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Also, please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Credit Risk Management” in this report for information relating to nonaccrual, past due, restructured loans, and other credit risk matters.  For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

44

As illustrated in Table 5 below, the ACL increased as a percentage of total loans to 1.01% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 0.95% as of December 31, 2023.  The provision for credit losses, including provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures, totaled $61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is an increase of $19.8 million, or 48.1%, compared to the same period in 2023.  The provision for credit losses, including provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures, totaled $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  This increase is the result of the impacts of loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior period.

Noninterest Income

A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates.  Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates.  Noninterest income increased in 2024 by $86.3 million, or 15.9%, compared to 2023 and decreased in 2023 by $12.4 million, or 2.2%, compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 is primarily driven by increased trust and securities processing income, other miscellaneous income, investment securities gains, net, and bankcard income.  The decrease in 2023 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment securities gains, net, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous income and trust securities processing income. Changes in Noninterest income are presented in Table 6 below.

45

The Company’s fee-based services offer multiple products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer product demands.  The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage and cash and treasury management.  Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

Noninterest income and the year-over-year changes in noninterest income are summarized in Table 6 above.  The dollar change and percent change columns highlight the respective net increase or decrease in the categories of noninterest income in 2024 compared to 2023, and in 2023 compared to 2022.

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, and mutual fund assets servicing.  This income category increased by $33.4 million, or 13.0% in 2024, compared to 2023, and increased by $20.0 million, or 8.4%, in 2023, compared to 2022.  During 2024, fund services income increased $20.5 million, corporate trust income increased $7.7 million and wealth management services increased $5.1 million.  During 2023, fund services income increased $12.2 million and corporate trust income increased $7.7 million.  The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category.  Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income will be affected by changes in the securities markets.  Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.

 Trading and investment banking income increased $4.6 million, or 23.4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $3.6 million, or 15.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 and the decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by increased and decreased bond trading income, respectively.

Service charges on deposits income decreased $0.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $0.2 million, or 0.3%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The decrease in both years was driven by decreased healthcare services income, offset by increased commercial service charge income.

Brokerage fees increased $7.4 million, or 13.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $11.1 million, or 25.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in both years was driven by increased 12b-1 and money market fees driven by the increase in short-term interest rates.

Bankcard fees increased $13.1 million, or 17.5%, in 2024 compared to 2023, and increased $1.3 million, or 1.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  These increases were primarily driven by increased interchange income.

Investment securities gains, net increased $13.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $61.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by gain on sale of one of the Company's securities without readily determinable fair value in 2024, coupled with the impairment of one available-for-sale debt security in 2023.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily driven by a $66.2 million gain realized on the sale of the Company’s Visa Inc. Class B common shares in 2022.

46

Other noninterest income increased $14.1 million, or 26.4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $21.0 million, or 64.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of UMB Distribution Services, LLC, a legal settlement, and gains on the sale of other assets during 2024, coupled with increased bank-owned life insurance income. The increase in 2023 was primarily driven by market value changes in company-owned life insurance income.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased in 2024 by $27.5 million, or 2.8%, compared to 2023 and increased in 2023 by $101.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2022.  From 2023 to 2024 the increase was driven primarily by increased salaries and employee benefits expense, legal and consulting expense, and processing fees, partially offset by a decrease in regulatory fees.  From 2022 to 2023 the increase was driven by the $52.8 million FDIC special assessment, increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and processing fees, and partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense.  Table 7 below summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year changes for each category.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $40.5 million, or 7.3%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and $29.0 million, or 5.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  In 2024, bonus and commission expense increased $22.4 million, or 19.5%, salaries and wage expense increased $14.0 million, or 4.1% and employee benefits expense increased $4.1 million, or 4.1%.  In 2023, salaries and wage expense increased $23.8 million, or 7.5% and employee benefits expense increased $20.5 million, or 26.0%.  These increases were offset by a decrease in bonus and commission expense of $15.3 million, or 11.8%.

Equipment expense decreased $5.3 million, or 7.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, and decreased $5.5 million, or 7.5%, from 2022 to 2023.  The decreases in both years were driven by lower software expense related to a transition to cloud-based computing solutions.

Marketing and business development expense increased $2.7 million, or 10.4%, in 2024 compared to 2023, and was flat in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 was driven by the timing of advertising and business development projects and higher travel expenses as compared to the prior year.

Processing fees expense increased $14.8 million, or 14.4%, in 2024 compared to 2023, and increased $20.9 million, or 25.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increases in 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by higher software subscription costs due to the transition to cloud computing solutions and ongoing investments in digital channel and integrated platform solutions to support business growth.

Legal and consulting expense increased $16.2 million, or 54.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $9.1 million, or 23.3%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The increase in 2024 was driven by expenses incurred related to

the announced acquisition of HTLF.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily driven by fluctuations in legal and consulting expense due to the timing of multiple projects between years.

Bankcard expense increased $11.3 million, or 34.3%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $6.6 million, or 25.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  These increases in both years were driven by higher card administration costs coupled with higher fraud losses.

Regulatory fees decreased $45.1 million, or 58.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $61.6 million, or 400.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The decrease in 2024 and the increase in 2023 was driven by the FDIC special assessment of $52.8 million recorded in 2023.

Other noninterest expense decreased $3.7 million, or 10.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $8.9 million, or 20.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022.  The decreases in both 2024 and 2023 were driven by lower charitable contribution expenses and operational losses.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense totaled $100.0 million, $71.6 million, and $100.3 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. These amounts equate to effective tax rates of 18.5%, 17.0%, and 18.9% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2023 to 2024 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and higher non-deductible acquisition costs in 2024. These increases were partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits, net of related amortization.  The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 is primarily attributable to a larger portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and excludable life insurance policy gains.

For further information on income taxes refer to Note 16, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Segments

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking (collectively, the Business Segments). Senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company’s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments.  The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each Business Segment using methodologies that are refined on an ongoing basis. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at December 31, 2024.  Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-K to conform to the Company’s current organizational structure.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Commercial Banking net income increased $69.2 million, or 27.8%, to $318.2 million compared to the same period in 2023.  Net interest income increased $67.2 million, or 11.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period last year, driven by strong loan growth, earning asset mix changes and the increase in short-term interest rates.

Noninterest income increased $32.6 million, or 33.4%, over the same period in 2023.  This increase was primarily due to increases of $11.0 million in investment security gains, $7.4 million in bankcard income, $5.8 million in other income driven by a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2024 and increased life insurance income, and $4.0 million in service charges on deposit accounts.  Noninterest expense decreased $9.7 million, or 2.7%, as compared to the same period in 2023.  This decrease was driven by a decrease of $20.8 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, partially offset by increases of $7.0 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $2.1 million in marketing and business development, $1.6 million in processing fees and $1.6 million in bankcard expense.

Net interest income increased $7.1 million, or 3.7%, compared to the same period last year, due to an increase in funds transfer pricing due to the increase in interest rates.  Provision for credit losses increased $1.4 million as compared to 2023, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in the macro-economic metrics in 2024 as compared to 2023.  Noninterest income increased $50.4 million, or 14.5%, primarily due to increases of $28.4 million in trust and securities processing income driven by higher fund services and corporate trust revenue, an increase of $7.1 million in brokerage income, $6.5 million in bankcard income, an increase of $4.7 million in bond trading income, and an increase of $4.0 million in other income driven by the gain on the sale of UMB Distribution Services, LLC during the fourth quarter.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in service charges on deposit accounts.  Noninterest expense increased $25.6 million, or 6.7% as compared to 2023, primarily driven by increases of $18.0 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $8.6 million in bankcard expense, $6.1 million in processing fees, $1.7 million in legal and consulting expense, and $1.2 million in equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.1 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses.

Balance Sheet Analysis

Loans and Loans Held For Sale

Loans represent the Company’s largest source of interest income.  Loan balances held for investment increased by $2.5 billion, or 10.7%, in 2024.  This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $1.2 billion, or 13.9%, in commercial real estate loans, $971.6 million, or 9.8%, in commercial and industrial loans, and $226.5 million, or 7.7% in consumer real estate loans.

Commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans continue to represent the largest segments of the Company’s loan portfolio, comprising approximately 42.5% and 39.5%, respectively, of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 2024 and 42.8% and 38.4%, respectively, of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 2023.

Commercial and industrial loans represent the largest percent of total loans.  Commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2024 increased $971.6 million, or 9.8%, as compared to December 31, 2023.

As a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate comprises 39.5% of total loans compared to 38.4% in 2023.  Commercial real estate loans increased $1.2 billion, or 13.9%, compared to 2023.  Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than consumer real estate loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower’s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options, which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Due to these risks, the Company is actively monitoring its exposure to commercial real estate.

Generally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80%.  Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have guarantees as additional security. The Company’s investment CRE portfolio (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) totaled 28.5% and 26.5% of total Company loans as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average investment CRE loan was approximately $7.2 million and $5.8 million, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 90% are recourse loans as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These loans have an average loan-to-value of 57% as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Notwithstanding, commercial real estate loans, in general, may be more adversely impacted by conditions in the real estate market or the economy.

The following table presents the Company’s investment CRE (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) by industry.  The table separately discloses the top five industries as a percentage of the Company’s loan portfolio as of either period presented, while the remainder are included in “Other.”

The shift to work-from-home and hybrid work environments has caused a decreased utilization of, and demand for, office space.  The Company is actively monitoring its exposure to office space in its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio.  The average loan size in the Company’s office portfolio was approximately $8.9 million and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  The average loan-to-value of the office portfolio was 63% and 64% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 84% are recourse loans as of the end of both periods. Further, only 18% and 30% of the Company’s office portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is in central business districts, which have been more heavily impacted by the shift to remote work. The remainder of the Company’s office portfolio is in suburban or medical properties.

Consumer real estate loans increased $226.5 million, or 7.7%, compared to 2023.  These loans represented 12.4% of total loans as of December 31, 2024, compared to 12.8% as of December 31, 2023.

For further information on loan portfolio segments refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk – Credit Risk Management” in Item 7A of this report.

Investment Securities

The Company’s investment portfolio contains trading, available-for-sale (AFS), and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as well as FRB stock, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and other miscellaneous investments.  Investment securities totaled $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and comprised 28.5% and 31.9% of the Company’s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates.

During 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion were transferred from the AFS classification to the HTM classification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.  The transfers of securities were made at fair value at the time of transfer.  See further information in Note 4, “Securities” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s AFS securities portfolio comprised 56.9% of the Company’s investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2024, compared to 53.3% at December 31, 2023.  The Company’s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities.  This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources.  The average life of the AFS securities portfolio increased from 52.6 months at December 31, 2023 to 56.0 months at December 31, 2024. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity.  The Company’s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company’s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk and credit risk.

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities.  There were $10.5 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at December 31, 2024.

The Company’s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private placement bonds.  The Company’s HTM portfolio, net of the ACL totaled $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $312.3 million from December 31, 2023.  The average life of the HTM portfolio was 9.1 years at December 31, 2024, compared to 8.4 years at December 31, 2023.

52

The securities portfolio generates the Company’s second largest component of interest income.  The AFS, HTM, and Other securities portfolios achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.96% for 2024, compared to 2.66% in 2023.  Securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $633.3 million at year-end, compared to a net unrealized loss of $624.2 million the preceding year.

This market value change primarily reflects the impact of a longer average life and increasing market interest rates as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.  These amounts are reflected, on an after-tax basis, in the Company’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in shareholders’ equity, as an unrealized loss of $478.5 million at year-end 2024, compared to an unrealized loss of $471.9 million for 2023. The AFS securities portfolio contains securities that have unrealized losses (see the table of these securities in Note 4, “Securities,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The unrealized losses in the Company’s investments were caused by changes in interest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers.  The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and Government Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-backed securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company does not believe the decline in value in these portfolios is related to credit impairments and instead is due to increasing market interest rates.  For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the majority of the Company’s holdings are in general obligation bonds, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt.  For the State and political, Corporates, and Collateralized loan obligations portfolios, the Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis.  The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends.  The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost.  As of December 31, 2024, there is no ACL related to the Company’s available-for-sale securities as the decline in fair value did not result from credit issues.

Included in Tables 14 and 15 are analyses of the fair value and average yield (tax-equivalent basis) of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

Other Earning Assets

Federal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial institutions, which allow for either the daily investment of excess funds or the daily borrowing of another institution’s funds in order to meet short-term liquidity needs.  The net borrowed position was $70.4 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $8.8 million at December 31, 2023.

The Bank buys and sells federal funds as agent for non-affiliated banks.  Because the transactions are pursuant to agency arrangements, these transactions do not appear on the balance sheet and averaged $161.7 million in 2024 and $192.6 million in 2023.

At December 31, 2024, the Company held securities purchased under agreements to resell of $545.0 million compared to $240.3 million at December 31, 2023.  The Company uses these instruments as short-term secured investments, in lieu of selling federal funds, or to acquire securities required for collateral purposes.  Balances will fluctuate based on the Company’s liquidity and investment decisions as well as the Company’s correspondent bank borrowing levels.  These investments averaged $303.0 million in 2024 and $310.5 million in 2023.

The Company also maintains an active securities trading inventory.  The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 2024 were $22.3 million, compared to $14.0 million in 2023, and were recorded at fair market value.  As discussed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Trading Account” in Part II, Item 7A, the Company offsets the trading account securities by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily.

Interest-bearing due from banks totaled $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 compared to $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and includes amounts due from the FRB and interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions.  The amount due from the FRB averaged $3.4 billion and $2.0 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase in the FRB balance at December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in deposit balances.  The interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions totaled $110.8 million and $78.7 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits represent the Company’s primary funding source for its asset base.  In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company’s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its asset management and mutual fund servicing businesses in order to attract and retain additional core deposits.  Deposits totaled $43.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and $35.8 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $7.3 billion, or 20.5%. There were $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion of brokered deposits as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deposits averaged $35.3 billion in 2024, and $31.8 billion in 2023.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits averaged $10.1 billion in 2024 and $10.6 billion in 2023.  These deposits represented 28.5% of average deposits in 2024, compared to 33.5% in 2023.  The Company’s large commercial customer base provides a significant source of noninterest-bearing deposits.  Many of these commercial accounts do not earn interest; however, they receive an earnings credit to offset the cost of other services provided by the Company.

As of December 31, 2024, there were an estimated $31.0 billion of uninsured deposits, as compared to $24.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 72.0% and 68.2% of total deposits as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  A portion of these uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at the Bank.  Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.4 billion and collateralized deposits of $6.0 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $22.7 billion as of December 31, 2024.  Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.0 billion and collateralized deposits of $6.2 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 52.6% and 45.3% as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of deposits in the program, respectively.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which it believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities.  Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets, and higher expenses for extended liability maturities.  The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary’s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders’ equity increased $366.1 million, or 11.8% to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders’ equity from 2023 to 2024 is largely due to an increase in retained earnings.

The Board authorized, at its April 26, 2022 meeting, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company’s common stock during the twelve months following the meeting (a Repurchase Authorization).  The Board authorized, at its July 25, 2023, and April 30, 2024 meetings, the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock.  The July 2023 Repurchase Authorization terminated on April 30, 2024, and the April 2024 Repurchase Authorization will terminate on April 29, 2025.  During 2024 and 2023,  the Company did not

57

repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to any of its announced Repurchase Authorizations.  The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.

On April 28, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with HTLF, a Delaware corporation and Blue Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement and the merger were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and HTLF. Pending regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of the Company and HTLF, and the merger closed on January 31, 2025. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, HTLF stockholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.55 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of HTLF stock, with a total market value of approximately $2.8 billion.

Additionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2.8 million shares of its common stock. The underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420 thousand shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28, 2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to the 420 thousand shares of the Company's common stock. The forward sale agreements are classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, 
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
. The Company expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $231.8 million from the sale of shares of common stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution’s assets.  The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB.  Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%.  A financial institution’s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets.

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset.  Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings.  The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%.  The leverage ratio is tier 1 core capital to total average assets less goodwill and intangibles.  The Company's capital position as of December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company, under an agreement to repurchase the same issues at an agreed-upon price and date.  Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2024, and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased averaged $2.3 billion in 2024 and $2.2 billion in 2023.  The Company enters into these transactions with its downstream correspondent banks, commercial customers, and various trust, mutual fund, and local government relationships.

The Company is a member bank with the FHLB of Des Moines, and through this relationship, the Company owns FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances.  The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB.  As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $10.2 million and $55.2 million of FHLB stock, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding advances at the FHLB of Des Moines. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had one short-term advance for $1.0 billion outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines.  Additionally, in both 2024 and 2023, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. The letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2024 expired in January 2025 and was subsequently renewed with an expiration date in March 2025.  Based on the collateral pledged, the Company had $1.8 billion of borrowing capacity remaining at the FHLB at December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the BTFP. The FRB terminated the BTFP during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $12.5 billion.

In addition to the borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of $12.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of December 31, 2024.

Long-term debt totaled $385.3 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $383.2 million at December 31, 2023.  In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032.  The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering

59

expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank.  The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64% due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027.

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030.  The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.

The remainder of the Company’s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) in 2015 and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities.  These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million and had a carrying value of $76.8 million at December 31, 2024 and $75.6 million at December 31, 2023.  Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month term SOFR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.  For further information on long-term debt refer to Note 9, “Borrowed Funds,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has material off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates.  These commitments and contingent liabilities are not required to be recorded on the Company’s balance sheet.  Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.  See Table 20 below, as well as Note 15, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for detailed information and further discussion of these arrangements.  Management does not anticipate any material losses from its off-balance sheet arrangements.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were $8.3 million.  The Company cannot reasonably estimate the settlement of these liabilities.  Therefore, these liabilities have been excluded from the table above.  See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits.

For further discussion of capital and liquidity, see the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Liquidity Risk” in Item 7A of this report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies and litigation.  Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates.

Management believes that the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to the allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company’s ACL represents management’s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company’s assets held at amortized cost. The Company’s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company’s lifetime historical loss experience, management’s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management’s recorded ACL.  To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
.  The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost, which include the Company’s loan and held-to-maturity security portfolios.

The estimation process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans.  These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience

61

and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics.  This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that is based on evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement.  This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered in its estimate.

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company’s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis.  If the Company’s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s).  Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses.

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan and held-to-maturity security portfolios considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.  While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the ACL is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control, including the performance of its portfolios, the economy, and changes in interest rates. As such, significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance.  Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on the Company’s Provision for credit losses and ACL reported in its Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.

For more information on loan portfolio segments, the Company’s ACL methodology, and management’s assumptions in estimating the ACL, refer to the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” within Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management

Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument.  These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices.  Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading.

The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading.  The following discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.

Interest Rate Risk

In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates.  To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board.  The ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure.  The Company’s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis.  The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time.  On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps, rate floors, and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans, trading securities, trust preferred securities, and deposits.  See further information in Note 17 “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overall, the Company attempts to manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk and credit risk.

Net Interest Income Modeling

The Company’s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin.  This analysis incorporates all of the Company’s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment.  Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200-basis-point upward or a 300-basis-point downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two-year period.  In ramp scenarios, rates change gradually for a one-year period and remain constant in year two.  In shock scenarios, rates change immediately and the change is sustained for the remainder of the two year scenario horizon.  Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management outlook and repricing strategies.  Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes.  The results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results on a regular basis.

63

Table 21 shows the net interest income percentage increase or decrease over the next twelve- and twenty-four-month periods as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.

The Company is liability sensitive to changes in interest rates in the next year.  Net interest income is predicted to decrease in all upward rate scenarios and increase in all downward rate scenarios.  In year two, net interest income is predicted to increase in all upward rate shock scenarios and decrease in all downward rate shock scenarios.  In rate ramp scenarios net interest income is predicted to increase in all scenarios except for the 100-basis-point upward ramp scenario.  The Company’s ability to price deposits consistent with its historical approach is a key assumption in these scenarios.

Repricing Mismatch Analysis

The Company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time.  While a traditional repricing mismatch analysis (gap analysis) provides a snapshot of interest rate risk, it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not, in fact, reprice at the same time or the same degree.  Also, it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income.

64

Table 22 is a static gap analysis, which presents the Company’s assets and liabilities, based on their repricing or maturity characteristics and reflecting principal amortization.  Table 23 presents the break-out of fixed and variable rate loans by repricing or maturity characteristics for each loan class.

Trading Account

The Bank carries taxable governmental securities in a trading account that is maintained in accordance with Board-approved policy and procedures.  The policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account and requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and regulations and mandates the use of a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters.  The risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily.  This account had a balance of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $18.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading.  The discussion in Table 22 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.

Other Market Risk

The Company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts.  See Note 10, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms.  The Company utilizes a centralized credit administration function, which provides information on the Bank’s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal risk grading system and overall credit exposure.  Loan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards.  In addition, the Company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the Bank.  This review team performs periodic

66

examinations of the Bank’s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan administration.  The respective regulatory authority of the Bank also reviews loan portfolios.

A primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans.  Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans on nonaccrual.  The Company’s nonperforming loans increased $6.1 million to $19.3 million at December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.  There was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on nonperforming loans during 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The Company had $1.6 million and $1.7 million of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  Other repossessed assets totaled $26.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $7.6 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower’s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted.  The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash.

Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers.  The Company had $196 thousand of restructured loans at December 31, 2024 and $548 thousand at December 31, 2023.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity represents the Company’s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds.  The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds.  Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position.  The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets, which include $7.8 billion of high-quality securities available for sale.  The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits.  Additionally, management believes it can raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms in the future, should the need arise.

Another factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements.  All customer repurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security.  The U.S. Government, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require the Company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-insured deposit limitations.  These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed due to the pledging restriction.  At December 31, 2024, $10.5 billion, or 80.1%, of securities were pledged or used as collateral, compared to $10.1 billion, or 79.2%, at December 31, 2023.

The Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity.  These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit.  The total amount of these commercial commitments at December 31, 2024 was $18.8 billion.  Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.

The Company’s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases.  Management fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future.  The declaration and payment of dividends to shareholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of the Board and depend on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.  There can be no assurance the Company will declare and pay dividends to shareholders.  The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company.  For the most part, the Bank can pay dividends at least equal to its current year’s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval.  The Company also uses cash to inject capital into the Bank and its non-Bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as to fund strategic initiatives.

Additionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2.8 million shares of its common stock. The underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420 thousand shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28, 2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to the 420 thousand shares of the Company's common stock. The forward sale agreements are classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, 
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
. The Company expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $231.8 million from the sale of shares of common stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements.

 In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032.  The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027.

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030.  The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank.  The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.

The Company is a member bank with the FHLB of Des Moines, and through this relationship, the Company owns FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances.  The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB.  As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $10.2 million and $55.2 million of FHLB stock, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding advances at the FHLB of Des Moines. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had one short-term advance for $1.0 billion outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines.  Additionally, in both 2024 and 2023, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. The letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2024 expired in January 2025 and was subsequently renewed with an expiration date in February 2025.  Based on the collateral pledged, the Company had $1.8 billion of borrowing capacity remaining at the FHLB at December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the BTFP. The FRB terminated the BTFP during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $12.5 billion.

In addition to the borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of $12.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of December 31, 2024.

Operational Risk

Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties.  This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service.  This risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.

The Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions.  In the event of a breakdown in internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.  In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data.

69

The Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company’s operations.  These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company’s financial strength, the environment in which it operates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation.  The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis.  In certain cases, the Company has experienced losses from operational risk.  Such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income.  While there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls, systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

UMB Financial Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UMB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses on certain loans evaluated on a collective basis

As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total allowance for credit losses on loans was $259.1 million as of December 31, 2024, a substantial portion of which related to the allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis for the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments (the collective ACL). The collective ACL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a pool basis for loans where similar risk characteristics exist and is determined using relevant available information from internal and external sources related to historical credit loss experience, current

71

conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The Company uses probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) models for the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments. For the commercial and industrial segment, the collective ACL is calculated by modeling PD over future periods multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. For the commercial real estate segment, the collective ACL is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. Primary risk drivers are segment specific and include macro-economic variables and risk ratings of the individual loans within the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan segments. After the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, the Company reverts to historical loss experience for each portfolio using a cliff or straight-line reversion method. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative factors which represent adjustments to historical loss experience.

We identified the assessment of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and historical loss rates and their significant assumptions, including average prepayment rates, the economic forecast scenario, macro-economic variables, the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, lengths of time and methods of reversion, and risk ratings, and (2) the qualitative factors and their significant assumptions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the collective ACL, including controls related to the:

•
design of the collective ACL methodology

•
continued use of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models

•
determination and measurement of the significant assumptions used in the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models

•
continued use of the qualitative factors

•
performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models

•
analysis of the overall ACL results, trends, and ratios

•
risk ratings assigned to loans

We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•
evaluating the Company’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

•
evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the continued use and performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models by comparing them to relevant Company specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices

•
assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use

•
evaluating the methodology used to develop the economic forecast scenario and underlying assumptions by comparing it to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practices

•
testing the historical credit cycle period and evaluating the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends

72

•
testing individual risk ratings for a selection of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral

•
evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
UMB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its branches and offices primarily in the Midwestern and Southwestern regions of the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies to assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation.
Consolidation
The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements (references hereinafter to the Company in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include wholly owned subsidiaries).  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Interest on loans and securities is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding.  This includes the impact of amortization of premiums and discounts.  Interest accrual is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful.  Noninterest income is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied.
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the FRB.  Cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks.  Amounts due from the FRB are interest-bearing for all periods presented and are included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

This table provides a summary of cash and cash equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of

, respectively.

Loans and Loans Held for Sale
Loans are classified by the portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, specialty lending, commercial real estate, consumer real estate, consumer, credit cards, and leases and other.

A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan.  If a loan is collateral dependent, the Company records a valuation allowance equal to the carrying amount of the loan in excess of the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective rate, based on the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral.

80

A loan is accounted for as a modification made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty when a modification has been granted that is deemed concessionary and not temporary to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty.  The Company’s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions.  These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition.  If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered to be collateral dependent and is evaluated for credit loss as part of the allowance for credit loss analysis.
Loans, including those that are considered to be collateral dependent, are evaluated regularly by management.  Loans are considered delinquent when payment has not been received within 
30
 days of its contractual due date.  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal is 
90
 days or more past due unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal unless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible.

The adequacy of the ACL on loans is based on management’s judgment and continuous evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio. Consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to each specific segmentation of loans includes lifetime historical loss experience, the impact of the current economic environment, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and detailed analysis of loans determined to be collateral dependent.  The actual losses incurred over the lifetime of the portfolio, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ from the amounts estimated by management.

The Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, to address the credit risk to which the Company is exposed via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is included in the Accrued expenses and taxes line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  In order to maintain the allowance for off-balance sheet items at an appropriate level, a provision to increase or reduce the allowance is included in the Provision for credit losses line item in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.  The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected amount to be funded.
Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Loan fees (net of certain direct loan origination costs) on loans held for sale are deferred until the related loans are sold or repaid. Gains or losses on loan sales are recognized at the time of sale and determined using the specific identification method.
Securities
Debt securities available for sale principally include U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, certain securities of state and political subdivisions, corporates, and collateralized loan obligations.  Debt securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair value.  Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in AOCI until realized.

Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, based on management’s intention, and the Company’s ability to hold them to maturity.  The Company classifies certain U.S. Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, and securities of state and political subdivisions as held to maturity.

Trading securities, acquired for subsequent sale to customers, are carried at fair value.  Market adjustments, fees and gains or losses on the sale of trading securities are considered to be a normal part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking income.
Securities may be transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.  Transfers of securities are made at fair value at the time of transfer.  The unrealized holding gain or loss at the time of transfer is retained in AOCI and amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities.  
No
 gains or losses are recognized at the time of the transfer.

81

Equity-method investments
The Company accounts for certain other investments using equity-method accounting.  For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag.  When transparency in pricing exists, other investments are considered equity securities with readily determinable fair values. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  To test goodwill for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit.  If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required.  Otherwise, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying amounts to determine if an impairment exists and the amount of impairment loss.  An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value.

No
 goodwill impairments were recognized in 
2024, 2023, or 2022
.  Other intangible assets, which relate to core deposits, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships, are amortized over their useful life.  Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances dictate.   
No
 intangible asset impairments were recognized in 
2024, 2023, or 2022
.  The Company does 
no
t have any indefinite lived intangible assets.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is computed primarily on the straight-line method.  Premises are depreciated over 
15
 to 
40 year
 lives, while equipment is depreciated over lives of 
3
 to 
20 years
.  Gains and losses from the sale of Premises and equipment are included in Other noninterest income and Other noninterest expense, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including Premises and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.  The impairment review includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value.  If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value.  
No
 impairments were recognized in 
2024, 2023, or 2022
.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  The provision for deferred income taxes represents the change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year excluding the tax effect of the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available for sale and certain derivative items.
The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent these assets will more likely than not be realized. All available evidence is considered in making such determination, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized, and any changes to the valuation allowance are recorded in income tax expense.
The Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that it will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recorded as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 
50

82

 percent 
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained. The benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax positions are generally recognized in the first period in which the more-likely-than-not threshold is met at the reporting date, the tax matter is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or when the related statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. When the Company determines that an unrecognized tax benefit liability is no longer necessary, the liability is reversed, and a tax benefit is recognized in the period in which it is determined that the unrecognized tax benefit liability is no longer necessary.  The recognition, derecognition and measurement of tax positions are based on management’s best judgment given the facts, circumstance and information available at the reporting date.

The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other noninterest expense.  Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related liability lines in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company has recognized an immaterial amount in interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits.
Derivatives
The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Currently, 15 of the Company’s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships.  The remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives are not used to manage risks within the Company’s assets or liabilities. All changes in fair value of the Company’s non-designated derivatives and fair value hedges are recognized directly in earnings.  Changes in fair value of the Company’s cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Per Share Data
Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.  Diluted year-to-date income per share includes the dilutive effect of 
309,142
, 
260,177
, and 
406,477
 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and nonvested restricted stock units granted by the Company that were outstanding at 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Certain options and restricted stock units issued under employee benefit plans were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
no

outstanding stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2023
, there were 
55,649
 outstanding stock options or restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended 
December 31, 2022
, there were 
no
 outstanding stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.  For stock options, restricted stock, and service-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or an observed market price, if such a price exists.  For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is based on the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.  Such cost is generally recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, in some cases, when performance metrics are met. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation on an actual basis as they occur.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Troubled Debt Restructurings 
In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” The ASU eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also added requirements to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases, disclosed by credit-quality indicator and class of financing receivable. The amendments in this update were adopted prospectively on January 1, 2023.  The adoption of the amendments had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional and revised financial statement disclosures.  See Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” for related disclosures.
Equity-Method Investments 
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, “Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.”  The ASU allows entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits.  Previously, this method was only available for qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures.  The Company adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2024, upon which the Company elected to continue the use of the practical expedient under ASC 323-740-35-4 to account for low-income housing and historic tax credit investments.  Under the practical expedient, the cost of a tax equity investment is amortized in proportion to income tax credits only and is recorded on a net basis within income tax expense.  The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional disclosures. See Note 16, “Income Taxes” for related disclosures.

Segment Reporting
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The ASU requires expanded segment disclosures, including disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. The Company adopted the amended guidance for the annual financial statements in 2024 and the interim disclosure requirements will be effective for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional disclosures. See Note 12, “Business Segment Reporting” for related disclosures.
Income Taxes
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”  The ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.  The amendments in this update require additional disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional disclosures.

3. 
LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Loan Origination/Risk Management
The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level of risk within the loan portfolio.  Diversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.  Authority levels are established for the extension of credit to ensure consistency throughout the Company.  It is necessary that policies, processes, and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit transactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to.  The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the risk assessment on a continual basis.  Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews.  The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company’s policies and procedures.

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business.  Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower.  The cash flows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.  Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee.  In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds

84

for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts from its customers.

Specialty lending loans include Asset-based loans, which are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for traditional bank financing.  Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the loan, rather than on the borrower’s general financial condition.  The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan management practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite loans to these borrowers.

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans.  These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.  Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan.  The Company requires that an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in conformity with current market conditions and regulatory requirements.  The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner-occupied real estate.  Also included in Commercial real estate are Construction loans that are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis or absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners.  Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project.  Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project.  Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained.  These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, economic conditions, completion of the construction project, and the availability of long-term financing.
Consumer real estate loans, including residential real estate and home equity loans, are underwritten based on the borrower’s loan-to-value percentage, collection remedies, and overall credit history.

Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability.  The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and leases.  The underwriting and review practices combined with the relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk.  Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more are considered non-performing.
Credit cards include both commercial and consumer credit cards.  Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria similar to commercial loans, including an analysis of the borrower’s cash flow, available business capital, and overall creditworthiness of the borrower.  Consumer credit cards are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability.  The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer credit cards and periodically reviews the distribution of credit scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit risk on its consumer credit card loans. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company purchased a co-branded credit card portfolio. The purchase included $
109.4
 million in credit card receivables.
Credit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure.  Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk management practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process.  Control factors or techniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor’s financial capacity, and monitoring the client’s activities.  Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate characteristics.

Further, the Company has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable.

Credit Quality Indicators
As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and general economic conditions.
The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate loans. Changes in credit risk are monitored on a continuous basis and changes in risk ratings are made when identified.  The loan ratings are summarized into the following categories:  Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful.  Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is considered to be a Pass loan.  A description of the general characteristics of the loan rating categories is as follows:
•
Special Mention
 – This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the borrower’s credit position at some future date.  The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
•
Substandard
 – This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Assets so classified must 

89

have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified as substandard.
•
Doubtful
 – This rating represents an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage of strengthening the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined.  Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, liquidation procedures, capital injection, or perfecting liens.
Commercial and industrial
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial and industrial loans is included below:
Equipment, accounts receivable, and inventory
 General commercial and industrial loans are secured by working capital assets and non-real estate assets.  The general purpose of these loans is for financing capital expenditures and current operations for commercial and industrial entities.  These assets are short-term in nature.  In the case of accounts receivable and inventories, the repayment of debt is reliant upon converting assets into cash or through goods and services being sold and collected.  Collateral-based risk is due to aged short-term assets, which can be indicative of underlying issues with the borrower and lead to the value of the collateral being overstated.
Agriculture 
Agricultural loans are secured by non-real estate agricultural assets.  These include shorter-term assets such as equipment, crops, and livestock.  The risks associated with loans to finance crops or livestock include the borrower’s ability to successfully raise and market the commodity.  Adverse weather conditions and other natural perils can dramatically affect farmers’ or ranchers’ production and ability to service debt.  Volatile commodity prices present another significant risk for agriculture borrowers.  Market price volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues and expenses.
Overdrafts
 Commercial overdrafts are typically short-term and unsecured.  Some commercial borrowers tie their overdraft obligation to their line of credit, so any draw on the line of credit will satisfy the overdraft.
Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

The following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Specialty lending
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Specialty loans is included below:
Asset-based lending
 General asset-based loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate.  The purpose of these loans is for financing current operations for commercial customers.  The repayment of debt is reliant upon collection of the accounts receivable within 30 to 90 days or converting assets into cash or through goods and services being sold and collected.  The Company tracks each individual borrower credit risk based on their loan to collateral position.  Any borrower position where the underlying value of collateral is below the fair value of the loan is considered out-of-margin and inherently higher risk.
The following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by risk rating for asset-based loans as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Commercial real estate
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial real estate loans is included below:
Owner-occupied
 Owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate.  These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles.  The loans rely on the owner-occupied operations to service debt which cover a broad spectrum of industries.  Real estate debt can carry a significant amount of leverage for a borrower to maintain.
Non-owner-occupied
 Non-owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate.  These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles.  The key element of risk in this type of lending is the cyclical nature of real estate markets.  Although national conditions affect the overall real estate industry, the effect of national conditions on local markets is equally important.  Factors such as unemployment rates, consumer demand, household formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas.  In addition to geographic considerations, markets can be defined by property type.  While all sectors are influenced by economic conditions, some sectors are more sensitive to certain economic factors than others.
Farmland 
Farmland loans are secured by real estate used for agricultural purposes such as crop and livestock production. Assets used as collateral are long-term assets that carry the ability to have longer amortizations and

91

maturities.  Longer terms carry the risk of added susceptibility to market conditions. The limited purpose of some Agriculture-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment problems emerge.
5+ Multi-family
 5+ multi-family loans are secured by a multi-family residential property. The primary risks associated with this type of collateral are largely driven by economic conditions. The national and local market conditions can change with unemployment rates or competing supply of multi-family housing.   Tenants may not be able to afford their housing or have better options and this can result in increased vacancy.  Rents may need to be lowered to fill apartment units.  Increased vacancy and lower rental rates not only drive the borrower’s ability to repay debt but also contribute to how the collateral is valued.
1-4 Family construction
 1-4 family construction loans are secured by 1-4 family residential real estate and are in the process of construction or improvements being made. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget. Market conditions also play an important role in understanding the risk profile.  Risk from adverse changes in market conditions from the start of development to completion can result in deflated collateral values.
General construction
 General construction loans are secured by commercial real estate in process of construction or improvements being made and their repayment is dependent on the collateral’s completion.  Construction lending presents unique risks not encountered in term financing of existing real estate. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget.  Commercial properties under construction are susceptible to market and economic conditions.  Demand from prospective customers may erode after construction begins because of a general economic slowdown or an increase in the supply of competing properties.
Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

Consumer real estate
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer real estate loans is included below:
HELOC
 HELOC loans are revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential property. The primary risk is the borrower’s inability to repay debt.  Revolving notes are often associated with HELOCs that can be secured by real estate without a 1st lien priority.  Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic downturns.
First lien: 1-4 family 
First lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a first lien on 1-4 family residential property. These term loans carry longer maturities and amortizations.  The longer tenure exposes the borrower to multiple economic cycles, coupled with longer amortizations that result in smaller principal reduction early in the life of the loan. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values.
Junior lien: 1-4 family
 Junior lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a junior lien on 1-4 family residential property. The Company’s primary risk is the borrower’s inability to repay debt and not being in a first lien position. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic downturns.
A borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual.  Charge-offs and borrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-based risk factors.

Consumer
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer loans is included below:
Revolving line
 Consumer Revolving lines of credit are secured by consumer assets other than real estate.  The primary risk associated with this collateral is related to market volatility and the value of the underlying financial assets.
Auto 
Direct consumer auto loans are secured by new and used consumer vehicles.  The primary risk with this collateral class is the rate at which the collateral depreciates.
Other
 This category includes Other consumer loans made to an individual.  The primary risk for this category is for those loans where the loan is unsecured.  This collateral type also includes other unsecured lending such as consumer overdrafts.
A borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual.  Charge-offs and borrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-based risk factors.

Credit cards
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact Credit card loans is included below:
Consumer
 Consumer credit card loans are revolving loans made to individuals.  The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt which is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay. The highly competitive environment for credit card lending provides consumers with ample opportunity to hold several credit cards from different issuers and to pay only minimum monthly payments on outstanding balances. In such an environment, borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a personal catastrophic event.
The consumer credit card portfolio is segmented by borrower payment activity.  Transactors are defined as accounts that pay off their balance by the end of each statement cycle.  Revolvers are defined as an account that carries a balance from one statement cycle to the next.  These accounts incur monthly finance charges, and, sometimes, late fees.  Revolvers are inherently higher risk and are tracked by credit score.
Commercial
 Commercial credit card loans are revolving loans made to small and commercial businesses.   The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt which is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay. Borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a catastrophic event.
The commercial credit card portfolio is segmented by current and past due payment status.  A borrower is past due after 30 days.  In general, commercial credit card customers do not have incentive to hold a balance resulting in

96

paying interest on credit card debt as commercial customers will typically have other debt obligations with lower interest rates in which they can utilize for capital.

Leases and other
A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Leases and other loans is included below:
Leases
 Leases are either loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures or are loans related to all other direct financing and leveraged leases on property for leasing to lessees other than for household, family, and other personal expenditure purposes.  All leases are secured by the lease between the lessor and the lessee.  These assignments grant the creditor a security interest in the rent stream from any lease, an important source of cash to pay the note in case of the borrower’s default.
Other
 Other loans are loans that are obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., loans to non-depository financial institutions, loans for purchasing or carrying securities, or all other non-consumer loans.  Risk associated with other loans is tied to the underlying collateral by each type of loan.  Collateral is generally equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, 1-4 family residential construction and susceptible to the same risks mentioned with those collateral types previously.  Other risks consist of collateral that is secured by the stock of a non-depository financial institution, which can be unlisted stock with a limited market for the stock, or volatility of asset values driven by market performance.
Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from loans’ and HTM securities’ amortized cost bases to present the net amount expected to be collected on the instrument.  Loans and HTM securities are charged off against the ACL when management believes the balance has become uncollectible.  Expected recoveries are included in the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.  Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and is tracked over an economic cycle to capture a ‘through the cycle’ loss history.  Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in portfolio industry-based segmentation, risk rating and credit score changes, average prepayment rates, changes in environmental conditions, or other relevant factors.  For economic forecasts, the Company uses the Moody’s baseline scenario.  The Company has developed a dynamic reasonable and supportable forecast period that ranges from 
one
 to 
three years
 and changes based on economic conditions.  The Company’s reasonable and supportable forecast period is 
one
 year.  After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical losses.  The reversion method applied to each portfolio can either be cliff in which the Company reverts immediately to historical losses or straight-line over four quarters.

The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist.  The ACL also incorporates qualitative factors which represent adjustments to historical credit loss experience for items such as concentrations of credit and results of internal loan review.  The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.  The Company’s portfolio segmentation consists of Commercial and industrial, Specialty lending, Commercial real estate, Consumer real estate, Consumer, Credit cards, Leases and other, and Held-to-maturity securities.  Multiple modeling techniques are used to measure credit losses based on the portfolio.

The ACL for Commercial and industrial and Leases and other segments are measured using a probability of default and loss given default method.  Primary risk drivers within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans along with changes of macro-economic variables.  The economic variables utilized are typically comprised of leading and lagging indicators.  The ACL for Commercial and industrial loans is calculated by modeling probability of default (PD) over future periods multiplied by historical loss given default rates (LGD) multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs.

Collateral positions for Specialty lending loans are continuously monitored by the Company and the borrower is required to continually adjust the amount of collateral securing the loan.  Credit losses are measured for any position where the amortized cost basis is greater than the fair value of the collateral.  The ACL for specialty lending loans is calculated by using a bottom-up approach comparing collateral values to outstanding balances.

The ACL for the Commercial real estate segment is measured using a PD and LGD method.  Primary risk characteristics within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans, along with changes of macro-economic variables, such as interest rates, CRE price index, median household income, construction activity, farm income, and vacancy rates.  The ACL for Commercial real estate loans is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs.

98

The ACL for the Consumer real estate and Consumer segments are measured using an origination vintage loss rate method applied to the loans’ amortized cost balance.  The primary risk driver within the segments is year of origination along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and the home price index.

The Credit card segment contains both consumer and commercial credit cards.  The ACL for Consumer credit cards is measured using a PD and LGD method for Revolvers and average historical loss rates across a defined lookback period for Transactors.  The PD and LGD method used for Revolvers is similar in nature to the method used in the Commercial and industrial and Commercial real estate segments.  Primary risk drivers within the segment are credit ratings of the individual card holders along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and retail sales.  The ACL for Commercial credit cards is measured using roll-rate loss rate method based on days past due.

The ACL for the State and political HTM securities segment is measured using a loss rate method based on historical bond rating transitions.  Primary risk drivers within the segment are bond ratings in the portfolio along with changes of macro-economic conditions.  There is no ACL for the U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed HTM securities portfolios as they are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government.  For further discussion on these securities, including the aging and amortized cost balance of HTM securities, see Note 4, “Securities.”

See the credit quality indicators presented previously for a summary of current risk in the Company’s portfolio.  Changes in economic forecasts will affect all portfolio segments, updated financial records from borrowers will affect portfolio segments by risk rating, updated credit scores will affect consumer credit cards, payment performance will affect consumer and commercial credit card portfolio segments, and updated bond credit ratings will affect held-to-maturity securities.  The Company actively monitors all credit quality indicators for risk changes that will influence the current estimate.

Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for prepayments when appropriate.  The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a concessionary loan term has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company.

Credit card receivables do not have stated maturities.  In determining the estimated life of a credit card receivable, management first estimates the future cash flows expected to be received and then applies those expected future cash flows to the credit card balance.  Expected credit losses for credit cards are determined by estimating the amount and timing of principal payments expected to be received as payment for the balance outstanding as of the reporting period until the expected payments have been fully allocated.  The ACL is recorded for the excess of the balance outstanding as of the reporting period over the expected principal payments.

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis.  Loans evaluated individually include loans on nonaccrual, loans that include modifications deemed concessionary made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or any loans specifically identified, and are excluded from the collective evaluation.  When it is determined that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for undiscounted selling costs as appropriate.  All loans are classified as collateral dependent if placed on non-accrual or include modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

Modifications made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
In the normal course of business, the Company may execute loan modifications with borrowers.  These modifications are analyzed to determine whether the modification is considered concessionary, long term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.  The Company’s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions.  These modifications allow the borrower short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition.  If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note.

For the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
five
 modifications on residential real estate loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty with a total pre-modification loan balance of $
1.1
 million and a total post-modification balance of $
1.1
 million.  For the year ended December 31, 
2023, the Company did not modify any loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

102

The Company had 
no
 c
ommitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company has modified an existing loan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default.  Determination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
 had 
no
 lo
an modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within the 12 months following the modification date.

The unrealized losses in the Company’s investments were caused by changes in interest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers.  The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and GSE mortgage-backed securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates.

For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the majority of the Company’s holdings are in general obligation bonds, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt.  For the State and political, Corporates, and Collateralized loan obligations portfolios, the Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis.  The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends.

104

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $
4.9
 million impairment on one Corporate available-for-sale security.
As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was 
no
 ACL related to the Company’s available-for-sale securities as the decline in fair value did not result from credit issues.

There were 
no
 sales of securities held to maturity during 2024, 2023, or 2022.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $
4.1
 billion and a fair value of $
3.8
 billion were transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.  The transfers of securities were made at fair value at the time of transfer.  The unrealized holding gain or loss at the time of transfer is retained in AOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities.  
No
 gains or losses were recognized at the time of the transfers.  The amortized cost balance of securities held to maturity in the tables above includes a net unamortized unrealized loss of $

The unrealized losses in the Company’s held-to-maturity portfolio were caused by changes in the interest rate environment.  The U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed securities are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Therefore, the Company’s expected lifetime loss for these portfolios is zero and there is no ACL recorded for these portfolios. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates.
For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the Company’s holdings are in general obligation bonds as well as private placement bonds, which have very low historical default rates due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt.  The Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends. The underlying bonds are evaluated for credit losses in conjunction with management’s estimate of the ACL based on credit rating.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Payment of dividends by the Bank to the parent company is subject to various regulatory restrictions.  For national banks, the governing regulatory agency must approve the declaration of any dividends generally in excess of the sum of net income for that year and retained net income for the preceding two years.

The Bank maintains a reserve balance with the FRB as required by law.  During 2024, this amount averaged $
3.4
 billion, compared to $
2.0
 billion in 
2023.

At December 31, 2024, the Company is required to have minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capit
al ratios of 
4.5
%, 
6.0
% and 
8.0
%, respectively.  The Company’s actual ratios at that date were 
11.29
%, 
11.29
% and 
13.21
%, respectively.  The Company is required to have a minimum leverage ratio of 
4.0
%, and the leverage ratio at 
December 31, 2024
, was 
8.50
%.
As of December 31, 2024
, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well-capitalized the Bank must maintain total risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, common equity tier 1, and tier 1 leverage ratios of 
10.0
%, 
8.0
%, 
6.5
%, and 
5.0
%, respectively.  There are no conditions or events that have occurred since the receipt of the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s categorization.
In addition, under amendments to the BHCA introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as the Volcker Rule, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds. The limits on proprietary trading are largely focused on purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of short-term resale, benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital charges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance programs, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The fund activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are in conformance with the Volcker Rule.

See a description of the Company’s Repurchase Authorizations in Note 14, “Common Stock and Earnings Per Share,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provided in Item 8 of this report.

115

Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan
At the April 24, 2018 shareholders’ meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (OICP) which became effective as of April 24, 2018. The OICP permits the issuance to key employees of the Company various types of awards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards.  Service-based restricted stock unit awards contain a service requirement and the performance-based restricted stock unit awards contain performance and service requirements. The number of shares of the Company’s stock reserved for issuance under the OICP is 
5.40
 million shares.
At the April 30, 2024 shareholders’ meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the OICP pursuant to which, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s stock available for issuance under the OICP increased by 
1.85
 million shares. This increased the number of shares of the Company’s stock reserved for issuance under the OICP from 
5.40
 million shares to 
7.25
 million shares.
The service-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and the majority contain a service requirement with a four-year graded vesting schedule in which 
50% of the units are vested after two years
, 
75% are vested after three years
, and 
100% are vested after four years
.  Grants of service-based restricted stock units made beginning in 2023 contain a service requirement with a three-year pro-rata vesting schedule.  Certain other grants utilize vesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or have a cliff vesting.
The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and contain a service and a performance requirement.  The performance requirement is based on two predetermined performance requirements over a three-year period. The service requirement portion is a three-year cliff vesting.  If the minimum performance requirement is not met, the participants do not receive the shares.
The dividends on service-based restricted stock units are treated as two separate transactions.  First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock units.  Those cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock units.  Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock units have the same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, similar to all dividend transactions.  Dividends are not paid on performance-based restricted stock units.

12. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following 
three
 reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking (collectively, the Business Segments, and each, a Business Segment).  These segments reflect the type of customer served, how products and services are provided, how executive management responsibilities are assigned, and reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The Company’s CODM is comprised of a group of senior executive officers led by the Company's chief executive officer, chief administrative officer, chief financial officer, and the Bank's 
chief executive officer
.
Business Segment financial information is produced using an internal reporting system which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing (FTP), and allocations of noninterest expense and income taxes. The process for determining FTP is based on a number of factors and assumptions, including prevailing market interest rates, the expected lives of various assets and liabilities, and the Company’s broader funding profile. These estimates and allocations are periodically reviewed and refined. 
The CODM uses the Business Segment net income in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments, including evaluating the cost or opportunity value of funds within each Business Segment and identifying areas of focus for organic growth or acquisition.
 For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at 
December 31, 2024. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this filing to conform to the current organizational structure.

The following summaries provide information about the activities of each segment:
Commercial Banking
 serves the commercial banking and treasury management needs of the Company’s small to middle-market businesses through a variety of products and services.  Such services include commercial loans, commercial real estate financing, commercial credit cards, letters of credit, loan syndication services, and consultative services.  In addition, the Company’s specialty lending group offers a variety of business solutions including asset-based lending, mezzanine debt and minority equity investments.  Treasury management services include depository services, account reconciliation and cash management tools such as, accounts payable and receivable solutions, electronic fund transfer and automated payments, controlled disbursements, lockbox services, and remote deposit capture services.
Institutional Banking
 is a combination of banking services, fund services, asset management services, and healthcare services provided to institutional clients.  This segment also provides fixed income sales, trading and underwriting, corporate trust and escrow services, as well as institutional custody.  Institutional Banking includes UMBFS, which provides fund administration and accounting, investor services and transfer agency, and other services to mutual fund and alternative investment groups.  Healthcare services provides healthcare payment

117

solutions including custodial services for health savings accounts (HSAs) and private label, multipurpose debit cards to insurance carriers, third-party administrators, software companies, employers, and financial institutions.
Personal Banking

Products offered include deposit accounts, retail credit cards, private banking, installment loans, home equity lines of credit, and residential mortgages.  The range of client services extends from a basic checking account to estate planning and trust services and includes private banking, brokerage services, and insurance services in addition to a full spectrum of investment advisory, trust, and custody services.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates revenue that are within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
:

Trust and securities processing
 – Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, and mutual fund and alternative asset servicing.  The performance obligations related to this revenue include items such as performing full bond trustee service administration, investment advisory services, custody and record-keeping services, and fund administrative and accounting services.  These fees are part of long-term contractual agreements and the performance obligations are satisfied upon completion of service and fees are generally a fixed flat monthly rate or based on a percentage of the account’s market value per the contract with the customer.  These fees are primarily recorded within the Company’s Institutional and Personal Banking segments.

Trading and investment banking
 – Trading and investment banking income consists of income earned related to the Company’s trading securities portfolio, including futures hedging, dividends, bond underwriting, and other securities incomes.  The vast majority of this revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 320, 
Debt and Equity Securities
, and is out of the scope of ASC 606. A portion of trading and investment banking represents fees earned for management fees, commissions, and underwriting of corporate bond issuances.  The performance obligations related to these fees include reviewing the credit worthiness of the customer, ensuring appropriate regulatory approval and participating in due diligence.  The fees are fixed per the bond prospectus and the performance obligations are satisfied upon registration approval of the bonds by the applicable regulatory agencies.  Revenue is recognized at the point in time upon completion of service and when approval is granted by the regulators.

Service charges on deposits
 – Service charges on deposit accounts represent monthly analysis fees recognized for the services related to customer deposit accounts, including account maintenance and depository transactions processing fees.  Commercial Banking and Institutional Banking depository accounts charge fees in accordance with the customer’s pricing schedule while Personal Banking account holders are generally charged a flat service fee per month.  Deposit service charges for the healthcare accounts included in the Institutional Banking segment are priced according to either standard pricing schedules with individual account holders or according to service agreements between the Company and employer groups or third-party administrators.  The Company satisfies the performance obligation related to providing depository accounts monthly as transactions are processed and deposit service charge revenue is recorded monthly.  These fees are recognized within all Business Segments.

Insurance fees and commissions
 – Insurance fees and commissions includes all insurance-related fees earned, including commissions for individual life, variable life, group life, health, group health, fixed annuity, and variable

119

annuity insurance contracts. The performance obligations related to these revenues primarily represent the placement of insurance policies with the insurance company partners.  The fees are based on the contracts with insurance company partners and the performance obligations are satisfied when the terms of the policy have been agreed to and the insurance policy becomes effective.

Brokerage fees
 – Brokerage fees represent income earned related to providing brokerage transaction services, including commissions on equity and commodity trades, and fees for investment management, advisory and administration.  The performance obligations related to transaction services are executing the specified trade and are priced according to the customer’s fee schedule.  Such income is recognized at a point in time as the trade occurs and the performance obligation is fulfilled.  The performance obligations related to investment management, advisory and administration include allocating customer assets across a wide range of mutual funds and other investments, on-going account monitoring and re-balancing of the portfolio.  These performance obligations are satisfied over time and the related revenue is calculated monthly based on the assets under management of each customer.  All material performance obligations are satisfied as of the end of each accounting period.

Bankcard fees
 – Bankcard fees primarily represent income earned from interchange revenue from MasterCard and Visa for the Company’s processing of debit, credit, HSA, and flexible spending account transactions.  Additionally, the Company earns income and incentives related to various referrals of customers to card programs.  The performance obligation for interchange revenue is the processing of each transaction through the Company’s access to the banking system.  This performance obligation is completed for each individual transaction and income is recognized per transaction in accordance with interchange rates established by MasterCard and Visa.  The performance obligations for various referral and incentive programs include either referring customers to certain card products or issuing exclusively branded cards for certain customer segments.  The pricing of these incentive and referral programs are in accordance with the agreement with the individual card partner.  These performance obligations are completed as the referrals are made or over a period of time when the Company is exclusively issuing branded cards.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company also has approximately $
39.4

million, $
39.7
 million, and $
34.5
 million of expense, respectively, recorded within the Bankcard fees line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income related to rebates and rewards programs that are outside of the scope of ASC 606.

Investment securities gains, net
 – In the regular course of business, the Company recognizes gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities.  Additionally, the Company recognizes gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values and equity securities without readily determinable fair values.  These gains and losses are recognized in accordance with ASC 320, 
Debt and Equity Securities
, and are outside of the scope of ASC 606.

Other income – 
The Company recognizes other miscellaneous income through a variety of other revenue streams, the most material of which include letter of credit fees, certain loan origination fees, gains on the sale of assets, derivative income, and bank-owned and company-owned life insurance income.

The Board authorized, at its April 26, 2022 meeting, the repurchase of up to 
two
 million shares of the Company’s common stock during the twelve months following the meeting.  The Board authorized, at its July 25, 2023 and April 30, 2024 meetings, the repurchase of up to 
one
 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The July 2023 Repurchase Authorization terminated on April 30, 2024, and the April 2024 Repurchase Authorization will terminate on April 29, 2025.  All share purchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations are intended to be within the scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if the Company satisfies the manner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential common shares that were outstanding during the year.

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and futures contracts.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The contract or notional amount of those instruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.  Many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

122

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement.  These conditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the customer’s financial condition.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  The interest rate is generally a variable rate.  If the commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such time as credit is extended.  For credit card customers, the Company has the right to change or terminate terms or conditions of the credit card account at any time.  Since a large portion of the commitments and unused credit card lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on an individual basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation.  Collateral pledged by customers varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and equipment, stock, securities and certificates of deposit.
Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce.  Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company payable upon the non-performance of a customer’s obligation to a third party.  The Company issues standby letters of credit for terms ranging from 
three months
 to 
six years
.  The Company generally requires the customer to pledge collateral to support the letter of credit.  The maximum liability to the Company under standby letters of credit at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $
404.7

million and $
407.6
 million, respectively.  As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, standby letters of credit totaling 
$
26.7

million and $
29.7
 million, respectively, were with related parties to the Company.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities.  The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary.  Collateral varies but may include such items as those described for commitments to extend credit.
Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date, of a specified instrument, at a specified yield.  Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movement in securities values and interest rates.  Instruments used in trading activities are carried at fair value and gains and losses on futures contracts are settled in cash daily.  Any changes in the fair value are recognized in trading and investment banking income.
The Company uses contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the trading portfolio.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 notional amounts outstanding for these contracts.   There were

no
 open futures contract positions during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.  There was 
no

net futures activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.  The Company controls the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis.  For operating purposes, the Company maintains certain balances in foreign banks. Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly basis to avoid foreign exchange risk on these foreign balances.  The Company will also enter into foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange needs of customers.  The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a foreign currency at a future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy the foreign currency at the same future date to a customer.  During 2024, contracts to purchase and to sell foreign currency averaged approximately
 $
46.8
 million compared to $
19.3
 million during 
2023.  The net gains on these foreign exchange contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
6.1
 million, $
4.2
 million and $
3.4
 million, respectively.
With respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company’s business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas.  At December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any significant credit concentrations in any particular industry.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure
The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company.  The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.  The estimate is based on expected utilization rates by portfolio segment.  Utilization rates are influenced by historical trends and current conditions.  The expected utilization rates are applied to the total commitment to determine the expected amount to be funded.  The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected amount to be funded.
The following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:
Revolving Lines of Credit: includes commercial, construction, agricultural, personal, and home-equity.  Risk inherent to revolving lines of credit often are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default.  During these financial troubles, the borrower could have less than desirable assets collateralizing the revolving line of credit.  The financial strain the borrower is experiencing could lead to drawing against the line without the ability to pay the line down.
Non-Revolving Lines of Credit: include commercial and personal.  Lines that do not carry a revolving feature are generally associated with a specific expenditure or project, such as to purchase equipment or the construction of real estate.  The predominate risk associated with non-revolving lines is the diversion of funds for other expenditures.  If the funds get diverted, the contributory value to collateral suffers.
Letters of Credit: includes standby letters of credit.  Generally, a standby letter of credit is established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and the applicant.  These obligations might be the performance of a service or delivery of a product.  If the obligations are not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.
The ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $
4.1

million and $
5.1
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was recorded in the Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  A reduction of $
950

thousand of provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024
. Provision of $
2.0
 million and $
500
 thousand were recorded for off-balance sheet credit exposures for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.  Provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the Provision for credit losses line of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to interpret tax laws and regulations to determine its taxable income.  Periodically, the Company is subject to examinations by various taxing authorities that may give rise to differing interpretations of these laws.  Upon examination, agreement of tax liabilities between the Company and the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns may ultimately be different.  The Company is in the examination process with four state tax authorities for various years between tax years 2020 and 2022.  The Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
Deferred income taxes result from differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities for income tax return purposes.

As of December 31, 2024, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximatel
y $
2.5

million are included in the miscellaneous deferred tax assets line item above.  These deferred tax assets include approximately $
70.2

million related to net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce our income taxes payable in those future periods.  Most of these net operating losses expire at various times between 
2025
 and 
2044

and some have an indefinite carryforward.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, due to cumulative losses, the Company established a state valuation allowance of $
3.8
 m
illion, against certain state deferred tax assets.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a valuation allowance of $
2.5
 m
illion and $
1.2
 million, respectively, for certain state net operating losses as they are not expected to be realized.  In addition, as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a valuation allowance of 
$
8.6
 million and $
2.1
 million, respectively, to reduce certain other state deferred tax assets to the amount managemen
t believes will be more likely than not realized.
The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are included in the Other assets line of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 2019 in the jurisdictions in which it files.

Liabilities Associated With Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled 
$
8.3

million and $
10.9
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of associated deferred tax benefit, that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $
6.5
 million and $
8.6
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits relate to state tax positions that have a corresponding federal tax benefit. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not expect this change to have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s loans and borrowings. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk of the Company’s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these

127

derivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets

The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Company’s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates.  Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.  As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company did 
no
t have any interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk.

During 2022 and 2023, the Company terminated 10 fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company's municipal bond securities.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
 the Company reclassified $
6.1
 million and $
4.7
 million, respectively, from AOCI to Interest income in connection with these terminated hedges.  The unrealized gain on the terminated fair value hedges remaining in AOCI was $
50.4
 million net of tax, and $
55.0
 million net of tax, as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The hedging adjustments will be amortized through the contractual maturity date of each respective hedged item.
For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps, floors, and floor spreads as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
two
 interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV.  These swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $
51.5
 million at both 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

128

Interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium.  Interest rate floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the purchased floor rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium, and involve payment of variable-rate amounts to the counterparty if interest rates fall below the sold floor rate on the contract. As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
13
 interest rate floors and floor spreads with an aggregate notional amount of $
3.0
 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.  As of 
December 31, 2023
, the Company had 
three
 interest rate floors and floor spreads with an aggregate notional amount of $
1.0
 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.

In 
2020
, the Company terminated an interest rate floor designated as a cash flow hedge.  As of 
December 31, 2024
 there was 
no
 gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI.  As of December 31, 2023, the gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI was $
2.7
 million, or $
2.0
 million net of tax.  The unrealized gain was reclassified into Interest income as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings through the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company’s hedged items.  Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor and floor spread derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments are received or paid on the Company’s items.  The Company expects to reclassify $
0.8
 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest expense and $
9.4
 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest income during the next 12 months.  As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 
11.7
 years.
Non-designated Hedges

The remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships.  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers.  The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.  Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.  As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.  The changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
298
 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
5.5
 billion related to this program.  As of 
December 31, 2023
, the Company had 
258
 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
4.3
 billion.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2024, the Com
pany had 
no
t posted any collateral as there were 
no
 deriv
atives in a net liability position. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2024
, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.

Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at

130

commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the hierarchy.  In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis:
Trading Securities 
Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities.
Securities Available for Sale 
Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available.  If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.  Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the year, if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold.  Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values 
Fair values are based on quoted market prices.
Company-owned Life Insurance
 Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.

Bank-owned Life Insurance 
Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.

132

Derivatives
 Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
Securities sold not yet purchased
 Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis:
Collateral Dependent Assets 
Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated as part of the ACL on an individual basis.  Those assets for which there is an associated allowance are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  Adjustments are recorded on certain assets to reflect write-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral.  The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued.  In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the Company’s property management group and the Company’s credit department. The valuation of collateral dependent assets and impaired loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis.  Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3.

Other real estate owned and Other repossessed assets 
Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets consist of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine

133

vehicles. Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets are recorded as held for sale initially at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs.  The initial valuation of the foreclosed property is obtained through an appraisal process similar to the process described in the collateral dependent/impaired loans paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are reviewed quarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those measurements are classified as Level 3.
Fair value disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

Cash and short-term investments 
The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of their fair values.
Securities held to maturity 
For U.S. Agency and mortgage-backed securities, as well as general obligation bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available.  If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.  Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate.  For private placement bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates.
Other securities 
Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and equity securities without readily determinable fair values, including equity-method investments and other miscellaneous investments.  The carrying amount of the FRB and FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount.  Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices.  Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Loans 
Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and credit card.  Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories.  The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows. The

135

discount rates used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs, and optionality of such instruments.
Demand and savings deposits 
The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts was the amount payable on demand at period-end.

Time deposits 
The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Other borrowings 
The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities. Federal funds purchased are classified as Level 1 based on availability of quoted market prices and repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are classified as Level 2.
Long-term debt 
Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt.
Other off-balance sheet instruments 
The fair value of loan commitments and letters of credit are determined based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  Neither the fees earned during the year on these instruments nor their fair value at period-end are significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

On 
January 31, 2025
, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Heartland Financial USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (HTLF), in an all-stock transaction, issuing a total of 
23.6
 million shares of the Company
’s common stock and 
4.6
 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of the Company’s 
7.00
% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Company’s preferred stock). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of 
April 28, 2024
, (i) HTLF merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and (ii) one day after the closing date of the acquisition of HTLF by the Company, HTLF’s wholly owned bank subsidiary, a Colorado-chartered non-member bank (HTLF Bank), merged with and into UMB Bank, National Association, the Company’s national bank subsidiary (the Bank), with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank
.
Total consideration for the acquisition was $
2.9
 billion, consisting of the Comp
any’s common stock valued at $
2.8
 billion (based on the Company’s common stock price of $
117.90
) and the Company’s preferred stock valued at $
115.2
 million (based on the Company’s closing preferred stock price of $
25.05
). Each HTLF common stock share was converted into 
0.55

138

finalized 
within one year from the date of acquisition. Measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date.

CONTROL
S AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
  At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “Disclosure Controls and Procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
  Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and effected by the Board, management and other personnel, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In addition, given the Company’s size, operations and footprint, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time.

Based on the evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), management (with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) under the oversight of the Board of Directors, has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective at the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  KPMG LLP, Kansas City, Missouri, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm ID: 
185
), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included within this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at the end of the period covered by this report.  KPMG LLP's attestation report is set forth below.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
  No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
UMB Financial Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited UMB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
