(1) Includes shares acquired pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. Under the terms of the Company's share-based incentive programs, the Company accepts previously owned shares of common stock surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with equity compensation. These purchases do not count against the maximum value of shares remaining available for purchase under Repurchase Authorizations.

(2) Includes shares acquired under the Board of Directors approved Repurchase Authorization(s).

On April 30, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company’s common stock, which will terminate on April 29, 2025 (a Repurchase Authorization).  The Company has not made any repurchases other than through the Repurchase Authorization, but did acquire shares pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. The Company is not currently engaging in repurchases.  In the future, it may determine to resume repurchases.  All share purchases pursuant to a Repurchase Authorization are intended to be within the scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if the Company satisfies the manner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own shares of common stock.  For discussion of management's intentions regarding dividends, see “Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and “Liquidity Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report.
