Forward-Looking Statements
​
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following discussion contain statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. In some cases you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” or the negative of such words or other similar words or phrases. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements because they involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:
●
the risk that we continue to incur losses and might never achieve or maintain profitability;
●
the risk that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and such capital may not be available to us, or if received, may not be available to us on favorable terms;
●
the risk that we may not be able to expand our business or manage our future growth effectively;
●
our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting;

the risk that delays in or not completing our product development and hydrogen plant construction goals may adversely affect our revenue and profitability;

the anticipated benefits and actual savings and costs resulting from the implementation of cost-reduction measures that include workforce reductions and limits on discretionary spending, inventory and capital expenditures;
●
the risks associated with global economic uncertainty, including inflationary pressures, fluctuating interest rates, currency fluctuations, and supply chain disruptions
;
●
the risk of elimination, reduction of, or changes in qualifying criteria for government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy products, or the nonrenewal of such subsidies and incentives;
●
the risk that the Department of Energy loan may be delayed, or that we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the Department of Energy to receive the loan;
●
the risks, liabilities, and costs related to environmental, health, and safety matters;
●
the risk that our lack of extensive experience in manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products may impact our ability to manufacture and market said products on a profitable and large-scale commercial basis;
●
the risk that a sale or issuance of a significant number of shares of stock could depress the market price of our common stock;
●
the risk of dilution to our stockholders and/or impact to our stock price should we need to raise additional capital;

The risks included here are not exhaustive, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance, including factors and risks included in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from these contained in any forward-looking statements. While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. Except as may be required by applicable law, we do not undertake or intend to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

Summary of Risk Factors
​
The risk factors detailed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. The following is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A:
●
We have incurred losses and anticipate continuing to incur losses;

●
We may not be able to expand our business or manage our future growth effectively;
●
If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud and may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, which can harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence;
●
We may be unable to successfully execute and operate our hydrogen production projects and such projects may cost more and take longer to complete than we expect;
●
The DOE funding of the loan may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan;

Our purchase orders may not ship, be commissioned or installed, or convert to revenue, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow;

The funding of the loan guarantee from the Department of Energy may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the Department of Energy to receive the loan guarantee;
●
The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy technologies, or the failure to renew such subsidies and incentives, could reduce demand for our products, lead to a reduction in our revenues, and adversely impact our operating results and liquidity;
●
Our future plans could be harmed if we are unable to leverage, attract or retain key personnel;
●
We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business;
●
Our ability to source parts and raw materials from our suppliers could be disrupted or delayed in our supply chain which could adversely affect our results of operations;

●
Unfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition, and overall results of operations;
●
Certain component quality issues have resulted in adjustments to our warranty accruals and the accrual for loss contracts;
●
We are dependent on information technology in our operations and the failure of such technology may adversely affect our business.

●
Our success depends on our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and execute our business strategy;

hydrogen generation projects, and manufacturing facilities,
 and failure of a supplier to develop and supply components on mutually agreeable terms or at all, or our inability to substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products, increase our cost of production, or affect our ability to generate hydrogen, which would in turn negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services;
●
We may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties for certain aspects of continued product developments, manufacturing, distribution, sale, servicing, and supply components for our products;
●
We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets, or properties, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, and impair our financial results; 
●
Our stock price and stock trading volume have been and could remain volatile, and the value of your investment could decline and if securities analysts do not maintain coverage of us or if they publish unfavorable or inaccurate research or reports about our business, our stock, or our industry, the price of our stock and the trading volume could decline;
●
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us;
●
Provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law may discourage or delay an acquisition of the Company by a third party that stockholders may consider favorable and may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a forum a stockholder finds favorable;
●
We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock;
●
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.
