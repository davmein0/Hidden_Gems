Item 1A. Risk Factors
​
The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following material risks could harm our business and future results of operations and could result in the trading price of our common stock declining and a partial or complete loss of your investment. These risks are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and trading price of our common stock. The discussion contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties. Refer to the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements”.
​
A. MARKET RISKS
​
We may be unable to successfully execute and operate our hydrogen production projects and such projects may cost more and take longer to complete than we expect.
​
As part of our vertical integration strategy, the Company is developing and constructing hydrogen production facilities at locations across the United States and Europe. Our ability to successfully complete, operate these projects and obtain green certification for some of these facilities is not guaranteed. These projects will impact our ability to meet and supplement the hydrogen demands for our products and services, for both existing and prospective customers. Our hydrogen production projects are dependent, in part, upon our ability to meet our internal demand for electrolyzers and liquefiers required for such projects. The timing and cost to complete the construction of our hydrogen production projects are also subject to a number of factors outside of our control such as delays related to contractors, suppliers or other third parties. Such projects may take longer and cost more to complete and become operational than we expect. For example, construction at our Georgia plant took longer than we expected before becoming operational in 2024.
​

The viability and competitiveness of our hydrogen production facilities will depend, in part, upon favorable laws, regulations, and policies related to hydrogen production. Some of these laws, regulations, and policies are nascent, and there is no guarantee that they will be favorable to our projects. For further information on risks associated with government regulations, see “Regulatory Risks”. Additionally, our facilities will be subject to numerous and new permitting, regulations, laws, and policies, many of which might vary by jurisdiction. Hydrogen production facilities are also subject to robust competition from well-established multinational companies in the energy industry. There is no guarantee that our hydrogen production strategy will be successful, amidst this competitive environment.
​
Our products and performance depend largely on the availability of hydrogen and recent insufficient supplies of hydrogen could negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services.
​
Our products and services depend largely on the availability of hydrogen. Although we are in the process of building multiple hydrogen production plants, our business could be materially and adversely affected by an inadequate availability of hydrogen or our failure to secure hydrogen supply at competitive prices. We produce liquid hydrogen at our Georgia and Tennessee facilities. There is no assurance that our hydrogen production will scale at the rate we anticipate or that we will complete additional hydrogen production plants on schedule or at all. Additionally, we are dependent upon hydrogen suppliers to provide us with hydrogen for the commercialization of our products and services. We have experienced supply chain issues relating to the availability of hydrogen, including but not limited to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts, which has led to volume constraints, delay in our deployments and service margin improvements, and negatively impacted the amount of hydrogen we have been able to provide under certain of our supply and other agreements. If hydrogen suppliers elect not to participate in the material handling market, or if supply chain issues relating to the availability of hydrogen continue, insufficient supplies of hydrogen may result. If hydrogen is not readily available or if hydrogen prices are such that energy produced by our products costs more than energy provided by other sources, then our products could be less attractive to potential users and our products’ value proposition could be negatively affected which could materially and adversely affect our sales and the deployment of our products and services.

Inflationary trends, economic uncertainty, market trends, political instability, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of us and our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.
​
Adverse economic conditions and political instability in the geographic markets we serve, such as tight credit markets, inflation, limited capital spending, delay or reduction in consumer spend, and changes in government priorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, increases in the cost of raw materials, and the expenses associated with the distribution and transportation of these materials and products we sell, can have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of us or our suppliers. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our products and services at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which could reduce our profit margins. For example, with respect to our service business, we have experienced inflationary increases in labor, parts and related overhead. This contributed to the increase in our estimated projected costs to service fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, which resulted in an increase in the provision for loss contracts related to service during 2024. If these trends continue, we may have to record additional service loss provisions in the future. We also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in consumer spending or a negative reaction to our pricing. 
​
Increases in interest rates may increase our cost of borrowing and result in limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and equity capital. In addition, if there is a government shutdown in the United States, especially a prolonged shutdown, it could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.
​
With respect to our customers, the demand for our products and services is sensitive to their production activity, capital spending and demand for their products and services. In the past couple of years, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad, including inflation and higher interest rates. Impacts of such economic weakness include falling overall demand for goods and services, leading to reduced profitability, reduced credit availability, higher borrowing costs, reduced liquidity, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, and bankruptcies. These developments have led to supply chain disruption and transportation delays which have caused incremental freight charges, which have negatively impacted our business and our results of operations. In addition, as our customers react to global economic conditions, we have seen them reduce spending on our products and take additional precautionary measures to limit or delay expenditures and preserve capital and liquidity. In 2024, we implemented price increases across our offerings including equipment, service and hydrogen fuel, which caused customers to change or delay their purchasing decisions with us. Reductions in customer spending on our solutions, delays in customer purchasing decisions, lack of renewals, inability to attract new customers, uncertainty about business continuity as well as pressure for extended billing terms or pricing discounts, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.
​
Additionally, many of our customers operate in markets that may be impacted by market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate changes, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.
​
Volatile commodity prices and shortages may adversely affect our gross margins and financial results.
​
Some of our products contain commodity-priced materials. Commodity prices and supply levels affect our costs. For example, nickel, platinum, titanium and iridium are key materials in our PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and hydrogen infrastructure. Platinum, titanium, and iridium are scarce natural resources, and we are dependent upon a sufficient supply of these commodities. These resources may become increasingly difficult to source due to various cost, geopolitical, or other reasons, which in turn might have a material adverse effect on our business.
​
17

Table of Contents
While we do not anticipate significant near- or long-term supply shortages with respect to our demand of platinum, titanium, or iridium, a shortage could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable PEM fuel cells, PEM electrolyzers, or hydrogen production facilities, or raise our cost of producing such products and services. In addition, global inflationary pressures have recently increased, which could potentially increase commodity price volatility. Additionally, the geopolitical events in Ukraine could have a potentially significant impact on iridium supply that may impact our ability to produce or products or raise our cost of producing such products depending on the volume of iridium needed and success of iridium reduction engineering design efforts. Our ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions, and the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins.
​
Our ability to source parts and raw materials from our suppliers could be disrupted or delayed in our supply chain which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
​
Our operations require significant amounts of necessary parts and raw materials. Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources; however, we believe there are some component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, particularly those suppliers and vendors that supply materials in very limited supply worldwide or supply commodities that have high degree of volatility, whose loss to us or general unavailability could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. If we are unable to source these parts or raw materials, our operations may be disrupted, or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, reduced availability or interruption in supplies, whether resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements, supplier financial condition, increases in duties and tariff costs, disruptions in transportation, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, severe weather, or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in 2023, we experienced shortages in the supply of liquid hydrogen due to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts. These volume constraints delayed our deployments and service margin improvements and negatively impacted the amount of hydrogen we have been able to provide under certain of our supply and other agreements. Furthermore, ongoing global economic trends have caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures, component shortages, and transportation delays, which have impacted our business.
​
We face risks associated with our plans to market, distribute, and service our products internationally. 
​
We market, distribute, sell and service our product offerings internationally and expect to continue investing in our international operations. We have limited experience operating internationally, including developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. Our success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability and that of our partners to secure and maintain relationships with foreign sub-distributors, and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements. Additionally, our planned international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and could be adversely affected due to, among other things, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, acts or threats of terrorism, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, fund transfer restrictions, capital controls, exchange rate controls, taxes, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, changes in legislation or regulations and other additional developments or restrictive actions over which we will have no control.
​
Doing business in foreign markets requires us to be able to respond to rapid changes in market, legal, and political conditions in these countries. As we expand in international markets and explore potential business activities across the globe, we may face numerous challenges. Such challenges might include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; potential conflicts or disputes that countries may have to deal with, among other things, data privacy requirements; labor laws and anti-competition regulations; export or import restrictions; laws and business practices favoring local companies; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables; difficulties in managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. We face risks associated with our plans to market, distribute, and service our products and services internationally and any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The success of our international expansion will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in navigating the different legal, regulatory, economic, social, and political environments.

Our investments in joint ventures may involve numerous risks that may affect the ability of such joint ventures to make distributions to us.
​
We currently conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants. Investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that our joint venture participants might experience business or financial stress that impact their ability to effectively operate the joint venture, or might become bankrupt or may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, in which case the joint venture may be unable to access needed growth capital without additional funding from us. For example, HyVia, our joint venture with Renault, entered receivership proceedings opened by judgment of the Commercial Court of Versailles in December 2024 as a direct consequence of the slow emergence of hydrogen mobility ecosystems locally, coupled with significant development costs of hydrogen innovation and an insufficient regulatory environment. Subsequently, HyVia has entered into a judicial liquidation proceeding opened by judgment of the Economic Activities Court of Versailles dated February 18, 2025 (judgment publication being still pending). In addition, our joint venture participants may have economic, tax, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or those of the joint venture, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Furthermore, joint venture participants may take actions that are not within our control, which may expose our investments in joint ventures to the risk of lower values or returns. Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our day-to-day business. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our co-venturers. Each of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
​
We made certain assumptions and projections regarding the future of the markets served by our joint venture investments that included projected raw materiality availability and pricing, production costs, market pricing and demand for the joint venture’s products. These assumptions were an integral part of the economics used to evaluate these joint venture investment opportunities prior to consummation. To the extent that actual market performance varies from our models, our ability to achieve projected returns on our joint venture investments may be impacted in a materially adverse manner. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with such joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations. In addition, should any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the joint venture to make future distributions to us.
​
Our products and services face intense competition.
​
The markets for energy products, including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and hydrogen production are intensely competitive. Our expansion into electrolyzer manufacturing and hydrogen production similarly faces robust competition — both from incumbent companies and new emerging business interests in the United States and abroad. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and may have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development, and commercialization of products more quickly and effectively than we can. There are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and alternative energy generation in the United States and abroad, including, among others, major electric, oil, chemical, natural gas, battery, generator and specialized electronics firms, as well as universities, research institutions and foreign government-sponsored companies. These firms are engaged in forms of power generation such as advanced battery technologies, generator sets, fast charged technologies and other types of fuel cell technologies. Well established companies might similarly seek to expand into new types of energy products, including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. Additionally, some competitors may rely on other different competing technologies for fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. We believe our technologies have many advantages. In the near future, we expect the demand for our products — electrolyzers in particular — to largely offset any hypothetical market preference for competing technologies. However, changes in customer preferences, the marketplace, or government policies could favor competing technologies. The primary current value proposition for our fuel cell customers stems from productivity gains in using our solutions. Longer term, given evolving market dynamics and changes in alternative energy tax credits, if we are unable to successfully develop future products that are competitive with competing technologies in terms of price, reliability and longevity, customers may not buy our products. Technological advances in alternative energy products, battery systems or other fuel cell, electrolyzer, or hydrogen technologies may make our products less attractive or render them obsolete. 
​

Table of Contents
We will continue to be dependent on certain third-party key suppliers for components of our products, hydrogen generation projects, and manufacturing facilities. The failure of a supplier to develop and supply components on mutually agreeable terms or at all, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products, could increase our cost of production or could affect our ability to generate hydrogen, which would in turn negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services.
​
We rely on certain key suppliers for critical components in our products, and there are numerous other components for our products that are sole sourced. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our suppliers or build relationships with new suppliers, or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand on mutually agreeable terms, we may be unable to manufacture our products, or our products may be available only at a higher cost or after a delay. The Company could experience supply chain-related delays for components of our products, hydrogen generation projects, and manufacturing facilities that could impact our cost of hydrogen production or could affect our ability to generate hydrogen. In addition, to the extent that our supply partners use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative sources. Furthermore, we may become increasingly subject to domestic content sourcing requirements and Buy America preferences, as required by federal infrastructure funding and various tax incentives in the United States, and we may become subject in the future to domestic sourcing requirements that may become relevant to the European Union. Domestic content preferences potentially mandate our Company to source certain components and materials from United States-based suppliers and manufacturers. Conformity with these provisions potentially depends upon our ability to increasingly source components or materials from within the United States. An inability to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to successfully leverage tax incentives or compete for certain federal infrastructure funding sources imposing such mandates.
​
In addition, the failure of a supplier to develop and supply components in a timely manner or at all, or to develop or supply components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes. Any such delays have resulted and could continue to result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments or loss of revenue and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
​
B. FINANCIAL AND LIQUIDITY RISKS
​
Our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue to meet our obligations is dependent upon our ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity.
​
Our ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry tailwinds and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. In 2024, we continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses of approximately $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
To operate more efficiently and control our expenditures, in 2024 we implemented a broad range of cost saving measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce reductions and various other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, in March 2025, we announced additional measures to optimize our operational footprint, resource and ongoing expenses, which included additional reductions in the workforce and additional reductions in discretionary spending, inventory and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that the anticipated cost savings, operating efficiencies or other benefits will be achieved, within the anticipated timeframes or at all, or that they will not be significantly and materially less than anticipated. Our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings is subject to many estimates and assumptions, including business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, such as our ability to maintain business relationships and successfully negotiate changes to existing agreements with respect to pricing increases, contract terms, and delivery times, among others. Many of these uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control and if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, it may impact our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings. In addition, our cost savings initiatives may subject us to litigation risks 
20

Table of Contents
and expenses and may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a negative effect on employee morale, productivity or ability to attract highly skilled employees.
​
If our cost saving measures fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits, it may negatively impact our current forecast of cash flows and we may be required to initiate further cost savings activities or negotiate further changes to existing agreements with vendors, suppliers and service providers. Further, our cost saving measures may result in unexpected expenses or liabilities and/or write-offs. Our lack of cash flows may also constrain our business and subject us to significant risks, including being unable to make the necessary investments in our business, which can adversely impact our ability to effectively pursue our business objectives, including delays in the construction of our hydrogen plants or delays in our ability to fulfill purchase orders. Our inability to successfully execute our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
To the extent our cost saving measures are not sufficient to drive a substantial reduction in cash burn throughout 2025 and we are unable to repay our debt and other obligations as they become due with cash on hand or from other sources, we will need to restructure or refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow more cash or raise equity. Additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing debt and other obligations, or if available, such additional debt or equity financing may not be available in a sufficient amount, on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations specified in our then existing debt instruments. In addition, in the event we decide to sell additional assets, we can provide no assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that could be realized by us from any such asset sale.
​
We have incurred losses and anticipate continuing to incur losses.
​
We have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation and we will continue to incur net losses until we can produce sufficient revenue to cover our costs. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.6 billion. We have continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. Our net losses were approximately $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $724.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities was $728.6 million, $1.1 billion and $828.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to devote significant resources to optimize our current production and manufacturing capacity, construct hydrogen plants and manage inventory to deliver our end-products and related services.
​
We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until we can produce and sell our products and services on a large-scale and cost-effective basis. We cannot guarantee when we will operate profitably, if ever. In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused. The profitability of our products depends largely on material and manufacturing costs and the price of hydrogen. The hydrogen infrastructure that is needed to support our growth readiness and cost efficiency must be available and cost efficient. We must continue to shorten the cycles in our product roadmap with respect to improvement in product reliability and performance that our customers expect. We must execute on successful introduction of our products into the market. We must accurately evaluate our markets for, and react to, competitive threats in both other technologies (such as advanced batteries) and our technology field. Finally, we must continue to lower our products’ build costs and lifetime service costs. If we are unable to successfully take these steps, we may never operate profitably, and, even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
​
We will have to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt transactions and/or complete one or more strategic transactions to continue our business and such capital may not be available to us or, if received, may not be available to us on favorable terms.
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had net working capital of $729.0 million, which was comprised of the net amount of current assets of $1.5 billion and current liabilities of $748.5 million. Included in net working capital as of December 31, 2024 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $205.7 million and current restricted cash of $198.0 million. This compares to net working capital of $822.2 million as of December 31, 2023, which was comprised of the net amount of current assets of $1.8 billion and current liabilities of $964.8 million. Included in net working capital as of December 31, 2023 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $135.0 million and current restricted cash of $216.6 million.
​
Our cash requirements relate primarily to working capital needed to operate and grow our business, including funding operating expenses, managing our inventory to support both shipments of new units and servicing the installed 
21

Table of Contents
base, supporting equipment leased and equipment related to Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) for customers under long-term arrangements, funding our GenKey “turn-key” solution, which includes the installation of our customers’ hydrogen infrastructure as well as delivery of the hydrogen fuel, continued expansion of our markets, such as Europe and Asia, continued development and expansion of our products, such as Progen, payment of lease obligations under sale/leaseback financings, mergers and acquisitions, strategic investments and joint ventures, liquid hydrogen plant construction, expanding production facilities and the repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt. Our ability to meet future liquidity needs and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the timing and quantity of product orders and shipments; attaining and expanding positive gross margins across all product lines; the timing and amount of our operating expenses; the timing and costs of working capital needs, including our ability to manage inventory; the timing and costs of building a sales base; the ability of our customers to obtain financing to support commercial transactions; our ability to obtain financing arrangements to support the sale or leasing of our products and services to customers, and the terms of such agreements that may require us to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements; the timing and costs of developing marketing and distribution channels; the timing and costs of product service requirements; the timing and costs of hiring and training product staff; the extent to which our products gain market acceptance; the timing and costs of product development and introductions; the extent of our ongoing and new research and development programs; and changes in our strategy or our planned activities.
​
To improve our financial condition and liquidity, we will have to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital we need on favorable terms when required or at all. In periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility, the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected. For example, we are party to certain agreements with collateral requirements and capital or margin calls, and we cannot predict when and what amounts may be called. We primarily use external financing to provide working capital needed to operate and grow our business. Sufficient sources of external financing may not be available to us on cost effective terms
. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we have implemented a broad range of cost saving measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce reductions and various other cost reduction initiatives, to reduce our cash burn. In addition, in March 2025, we announced additional reductions in the workforce and additional reductions in discretionary spending, inventory and capital expenditures. Our ability to continue our operations is contingent upon our ability to successfully implement cost saving measures such as those referenced above and if we fail to do so and are unable to raise sufficient capital and/or complete one or more strategic transactions, we would be forced to modify or cease operations, liquidate assets or pursue bankruptcy proceedings.
​
The DOE funding of the loan may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan guarantee.
​
On January 16, 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) agreed to arrange a multi-draw term loan facility to be provided by the Federal Financing Bank to a subsidiary of the Company (the “DOE loan”) to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities. Our ability to receive advances under the DOE loan is subject to certain conditions, including the achievement of certain milestones, which may not be achieved at the time that we anticipate, or at all. In addition, whether and when the DOE loan will be funded is subject to a number of factors outside of our control, including legislative enactments and administrative actions. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed the Unleashing American Energy Executive Order, which paused the release of federal funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) and Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act, including DOE loans and grants. As a result, the funding of the DOE loan may take longer than we expect and if we are not able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan, we may have to significantly reduce our spending, delay, or cancel our planned activities or substantially change our corporate structure, and we may not have sufficient resources to conduct our business as planned, which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
​
Our estimated future revenue may not be indicative of actual future revenue or profitability.
​
Our estimated future revenue represents, as of a point in time, expected future revenue from work not yet completed under executed contracts. As of December 31, 2024, our estimated future revenue was approximately $890.6 million. While we anticipate a significant amount of our estimated future revenue will be recognized as revenue over one to ten years, our estimated future revenue is subject to order cancellations and delays. We or our customers may attempt to cancel or modify orders in estimated future revenue, and we may not be able to convert all of our estimated future revenue into revenue and cash flows. In addition, if production of products are delayed resulting from parts availability 
22

Table of Contents
and other constraints stemming from supply chain disruptions, revenue recognition can occur over longer periods of time, and products may remain in estimated future revenue for extended periods of time. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in quarterly levels of estimated future revenue can result because the estimated future revenue may reach levels which may not be sustained in subsequent quarters. Our estimated future revenue should not be relied on as a measure of actual future revenue or profitability.
​
If we cannot obtain financing to support the sale of our products and service to our customers or our power purchase agreements with customers, such failure may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position. 
​
Historically, we have obtained or provided third-party financing sources to finance the sale of our products and services to our customers or our PPAs with our customers. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulty in obtaining or providing adequate financing for these PPA arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain or provide such financing has impacted our product sales and results of operations, and may result in the loss of material customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we have been required, and may be required in the future, to continue to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements. As a result, such cash will not be available to us for other purposes, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. For example, as of December 31, 2024, approximately $835.0 million of our cash was restricted to support such leasing arrangements, comprised of cash deposits and collateralizing letters of credit, which prevents us from using such cash for other purposes. Because we are currently focusing more on cash generation, we have paused new PPAs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and have shifted our approach to enable customers to deal directly with banks, which may temper short-term revenue growth. Although we expect PPAs to become a cash source in the near-term and for restricted cash to be released over time, our ability to realize these benefits is not guaranteed.
​
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business. 
​
At December 31, 2024, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $729.7 million, which consisted of $173.2 million of the $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Debenture due November 11, 2026 (the “6.00% Convertible Debenture”), $147.9 million of the $140.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2026 (the “7.00% Convertible Senior Notes”), $58.3 million of the $58.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2025 (the “3.75% Convertible Senior Notes”), $2.9 million of long-term debt, and $347.4 million of finance obligations consisting primarily of debt associated with sale of future revenues and sale/leaseback financings.
Our indebtedness could have negative consequences on our future operations, including:
●
we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;
●
we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes;
●
our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions could increase;
●
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general could be limited; and
●
our amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt.
​
Our ability to generate cash to repay our indebtedness is subject to the performance of our business, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
​
The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes or the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.
​
Under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 470-20, 
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes or the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the 
23

Table of Contents
accounting for the convertible senior notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible senior notes. As a result, we are required to record a non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible senior notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible senior notes. As a result, we report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include the amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock.
​
In addition, on January 1, 2021, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) using the modified retrospective approach. Consequently, the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes is now accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. This accounting change removed the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company’s convertible notes at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization. The cumulative effect of the accounting change upon adoption on January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by $120.6 million, reduced accumulated deficit by $9.6 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $130.2 million. Future interest expense of the convertible notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance and net loss per share will be computed using the if-converted method for convertible instruments.
​
The convertible note hedges may affect the value of our common stock.
​
In conjunction with the pricing of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “3.75% Notes Capped Call”) with certain counterparties at a price of $16.3 million. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that underlie the initial 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes 
and 
is generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call is initially $6.7560 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 60%

over the last then-reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $4.11 per share on the date of the transaction and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call becomes exercisable if the conversion option is exercised.
The option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes or following any repurchase of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, if any such convertible note hedge transaction fails to become effective, the option counterparties may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
​
We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. 
The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and are subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.

Unfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition, and overall results of operations.
​
Actual events, concerns or speculation about disruption or instability in the banking and financial services industry, such as liquidity constraints or lack of available credit, the failure of individual institutions, or the inability of individual institutions or the banking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractual obligations, could significantly impair our access to capital, delay access to deposits or other financial assets, or cause actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. Similarly, these events, concerns or speculation could result in less favorable financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our customers, suppliers and other business partners also could be adversely affected by these risks as described above, which in turn could result in their committing a breach or default under their contractual agreements with us, their insolvency or bankruptcy, or other adverse effects.
​
Any decline in available funding, lack of credit in the market, or access to cash and liquidity resources, or non-compliance of banking and financial services counterparties with their contractual commitments to us, our customers, suppliers and other partners could, among other risks, have material adverse impacts on our ability to meet our operating expenses and other financial needs, could result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations, and could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
C. OPERATIONAL RISKS
​
We may not be able to expand our business or manage our future growth effectively.
​
We may not be able to expand our business or manage future growth. We plan to continue to improve our manufacturing processes, which will require successful execution of:
​
●
expanding our existing customers and expanding to new markets;
●
ensuring manufacture, delivery, and installation of our products;
●
ensuring timely construction and completion of hydrogen generation projects, which may be delayed due to the Company’s inexperience with these project types, supply chain issues, and federal, state, and local permitting and regulatory issues;
●
implementing and improving additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems and procedures and controls;
●
integration of acquisitions;
●
leveraging existing personnel and/or hiring additional employees;
●
expanding and upgrading our technological capabilities;
●
managing relationships with our customers and suppliers and strategic partnerships with other third parties;
●
maintaining adequate liquidity and financial resources; and
●
continuing to increase our revenues from operations.
​
Ensuring delivery of our products is subject to many market risks, including scarcity, significant price fluctuations, and competition. Maintaining adequate liquidity is dependent upon a variety of factors, including continued revenues from operations, working capital improvements, and compliance with our debt instruments. We may not be able to achieve our growth strategy and increase production capacity as planned during the foreseeable future. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.
​
If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud and be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, which can harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.
​
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we fail to maintain effective internal 
25

Table of Contents
control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud and be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, which can harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.
​
Delays in or not completing our product and project development goals or products experiencing technical defects may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. 
​
Delays in meeting our development goals (including delivery of electrolyzers to customers, as well as the completion of hydrogen generation projects), products experiencing technical defects, or delays in meeting cost or performance goals (including power output) will delay the profitable commercialization of our products. If such an event or events occur, potential purchasers of our products may choose alternative technologies and any delays could allow potential competitors to gain market advantages. We cannot assure that we will successfully meet our commercialization schedule in the future.
​
Periodically, we may enter into contracts with our customers for certain products that have not been developed or produced. There can be no assurance that we will complete the development of these products and meet the specifications required to fulfill customer agreements and deliver products on schedule. Pursuant to such agreements, the customers would have the right to provide notice to us if, in their good faith judgment, we have materially deviated from such agreements. Should a customer provide such notice, and we cannot mutually agree to a modification to the agreement, then the customer may have the right to terminate the agreement, which could have a material adverse effect upon our future business.
​
Other than our current products, which we believe to be commercially viable at this time, we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete research and development of other commercially viable products that could be critical to our future. If we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products we may not be able to become profitable. The profitable commercialization of our products depends on our ability to reduce the costs of our components and subsystems, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce these costs. In addition, the profitable commercialization of our products requires achievement and verification of their overall reliability, efficiency and safety targets, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop, acquire or license the technology necessary to achieve these targets. We must complete additional research and development to fill our product portfolios and deliver enhanced functionality and reliability in order to manufacture additional commercially viable products in commercial quantities. In addition, while we continue to conduct tests to predict the overall life of our products, we may not have run our products over their projected useful life prior to large-scale commercialization. As a result, we cannot be sure that our products will last as long as predicted, resulting in possible warranty claims and commercial failures.
​
Our purchase orders may not ship, be commissioned or installed, or convert to revenue, which could have an adverse impact on revenue and cash flow.
​
Some of the orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied, or may be cancelled, prior to shipment or prior to commissioning or installation, some of which are outside of our control. Orders for the Company’s products and services approximated $890.6 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024. The time periods from receipt of an order to shipment date and installation vary widely and are determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the customer contract and the customer’s deployment plan. For example, we have experienced delays in product launches, and there may also be product redesign or modification requirements that must be satisfied prior to shipment of units under certain of our agreements. If the designs are not finalized on schedule or the redesigns or modifications are not completed, some or all of our orders may not ship or convert to revenue. In certain cases, we disclose anticipated, pending orders with prospective customers for our various products, including PEM fuel cell, electrolyzer, stationary product and hydrogen sales; however, those prospective customers may require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied prior to entering into a purchase order with us, some of which are outside of our control. Such conditions or contingencies that may be required to be satisfied before we receive a purchase order may include, but are not limited to, successful product demonstrations or field trials. Converting orders into revenue is also dependent upon our customers’ ability to obtain financing. Some conditions or contingencies that are out of our control may include, but are not limited to, government tax policy, government funding programs, and government incentive programs. Additionally, some conditions and contingencies may extend for several years. We may have to compensate customers, by either reimbursement, forfeiting portions of associated revenue, or other methods depending on the terms of the customer contract, based on the failure on any of these conditions or contingencies, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow.

​
Our future plans could be harmed if we are unable to leverage, attract or retain key personnel.
​
We have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce, including scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturing, and marketing and sales professionals. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to leverage, attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel. However, we do not know whether we will be successful in leveraging or retaining qualified personnel. Furthermore, our ability to retain key employees could be adversely impacted if we do not have a sufficient number of shares available under our equity incentive plan to issue to our employees, or if our stockholders do not approve requested share increases or a new equity incentive.
​
In February 2024, we announced the cost-reduction initiatives that included strategic workforce adjustments as well as other expense reduction initiatives (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). These initiatives may as yet yield unintended consequences and result in unforeseen costs well beyond the execution of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond our intended workforce adjustments, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees and adverse impact to our reputation as an employer, which may make it difficult for us to continue to retain remaining employees or hire new employees now or in the future. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees or to external service providers. If we are not able to successfully manage the above, there may be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may need to undertake additional workforce reductions or restructuring activities in the future. Additionally, in March 2025, we announced cost-reduction initiatives that are anticipated to include strategic workforce adjustments, facility consolidation, and other expense reduction initiatives (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”) that may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may yield unintended consequences and costs that are not fully realized until this year, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond our intended workforce adjustments, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees and adverse impact to our reputation as an employer, which may make it difficult for us to continue to retain remaining employees this year or hire new employees now or in the future.
​
In general, our industry continues to experience change and be subject to significant competitive pressures with respect to the retention of top talent. The loss of key employees may occur due to perceived opportunity for promotion, compensation levels or composition of compensation, work environment or other individual reasons. We have from time-to-time experienced, and we may in the future experience, labor shortages and other labor-related issues. A number of factors might adversely affect the labor force available to us in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration, and such factors can also impact the cost of labor. The Trump Administration has issued several executive orders restricting immigration and may, either through executive authority or through new legislation, impose additional restrictions. These and any future changes in immigration laws and enforcement policies could impact the availability and cost of labor. In addition, the IRA includes certain prevailing wage requirements related to tax credit availability which may impact labor costs of the Company and our contractors and subcontractors going forward. An increase in labor costs and the unavailability of skilled labor (including apprentices) or increased turnover could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The loss or interruption of the services by any of our key employees, the inability to identify, attract or to hire qualified personnel in the future, the inability to successfully implement executive officer, key employee or other personnel transitions, or delays in hiring qualified personnel could materially and adversely affect our development and profitable commercialization plans and, therefore, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
​
We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business.
​
We are currently, and in the future may continue to be, subject to legal proceedings and similar disputes. In connection with any disputes or litigation in which we are involved, we may incur costs and expenses in connection with defending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any ruling in connection therewith. It is often challenging to predict the outcome of legal proceedings and similar disputes with certainty. Determining reserves for any litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment calls. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, including diversion of management resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies”.

Certain component quality issues have resulted in adjustments to our warranty reserves and the accrual for loss contracts.
​
In the past, quality issues have arisen with respect to certain components in certain products that are currently being used at customer sites. Under the terms of our extended maintenance contracts, we have had to retrofit units subject to component quality issues with replacement components to improve the reliability of our products for our customers. We recorded a provision for loss contracts related to service in the current and prior years. Though we continue to work with our vendors on these component issues to improve quality and reliability, unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise, and additional material charges may be incurred in the future. Quality issues also could cause profitable maintenance contracts to become unprofitable.
​
In addition, from time to time we have experienced other unexpected design, manufacturing or product performance issues, which has led to delayed delivery dates. We make significant investment in the continued improvement of our products and maintain appropriate warranty reserves for known and unexpected issues; however, unknown malfunctions or defects could result in unexpected material liabilities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and prospects. In addition, an actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market’s perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products and could divert the attention of our management, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.
​
We are dependent on information technology in our operations and the failure of such technology may adversely affect our business. Security breaches of our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, or use of malware or phishing or other malicious techniques by threat actors, have in the past and could in the future impact our operations or lead to liability, or damage our reputation and financial results.
​
We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. The inability to implement new systems or delays in implementing new information technology systems may also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, the inability to implement or any delays in implementing new security measures can also affect our ability to protect against increasingly sophisticated threat actors. Any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws.
​
Information technology system and/or network disruptions could harm the Company’s operations. Failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from security compromises or breaches, including cyber-attacks, could result in the misuse of company assets, unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential business information, disruption to the company, diversion of management resources, regulatory inquiries, legal claims or proceedings, reputational damage, loss of sales, reduction in value of our investment in research and development, among other costs to the company. Although we believe risks from cybersecurity threats have not to date materially affected us, we have experienced and may continue to experience both successful and unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems on which we maintain proprietary and confidential information. For example, in or around March 2023, an unauthorized actor accessed our computer network and executed a ransomware attack, resulting in the encryption of certain of our computer systems, including systems used to store proprietary and confidential data, and exfiltration of personal information related to certain individuals. Upon detection, we took immediate steps to contain, assess and remediate the incident, including engaging outside legal counsel and external forensic investigators. We restored the affected systems and our business remained operational with no material disruption during the restoration period.
​
The risk of a security compromise, breach, or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, insider threats, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and harder to detect and fight against and threat actors continue to become more sophisticated in their malicious techniques. Additionally, outside or unauthorized parties may attempt to access our confidential information through other means, for example by fraudulently inducing our employees to disclose confidential information through phishing emails or deceptive advertising campaigns. We actively seek to prevent, detect, and investigate any unauthorized access. These threats are also continually evolving, and as a result, will become increasingly difficult to detect. In addition, the increased prevalence of employees working from home may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our information technology system has been and could be 
28

Table of Contents
penetrated by outside or unauthorized parties. To date, these risks, threats or attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, business strategy or financial results, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have a material impact in the future. Going forward, we may expend additional resources, expenses, and legal and professional fees to further enhance the security of our information technology systems and continually assess our current security measures. In addition, we may be subject to governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines or litigation, or we may suffer from reputational damage or public statements against us as a result of unauthorized access to our information technology systems. 
​
The delays in the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause disruption to our operations. 
​
The delays in the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in 2024 could impede our ability to manufacture products, order materials, generate management reports, invoice customers, and comply with laws and regulations. Any of these types of disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. In addition, the implementation of the new ERP system will require significant investment of human and financial resources. We may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, re-work due to changes in business plans or reporting standards, and the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. Extended delays could include operational risk, including cybersecurity risks, and other complications. If we are unable to implement the new ERP system as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
​
We may not be able to protect important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs defending against claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others. 
​
PEM fuel cell technology was first developed in the 1950s, and fuel processing technology has been practiced on a large scale in the petrochemical industry for decades. Accordingly, we do not believe that we can establish a significant proprietary position in the fundamental component technologies in these areas. However, our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary system-level technologies, systems designs and manufacturing processes. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other policies and procedures related to confidentiality to protect our intellectual property. However, some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application. Moreover, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will issue or, in the case of patents issued or to be issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes. Even if all of our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, our patents may be challenged or invalidated. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending patent infringement suits or otherwise protecting our intellectual property rights. For example, we have been subject to a lawsuit against Joule Processing, LLC and Plug Power Inc., which alleges misappropriation of trade secrets under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, among other complaints. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies”. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. Moreover, patent applications filed in foreign countries may be subject to laws, rules and procedures that are substantially different from those of the United States, and any resulting foreign patents may be difficult and expensive to obtain and enforce. In addition, we do not know whether the USPTO will grant federal registrations based on our pending trademark applications. Even if federal registrations are granted to us, our trademark rights may be challenged. It is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt trademarks similar to ours, thus impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending trademark infringement suits.
​
Furthermore, we might encounter difficulties protecting intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. Certain jurisdictions do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection. Enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and adverse impacts to our intellectual property rights. 
​
Further, our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If we are found to be infringing third party patents, we could be required to pay substantial royalties and/or damages, and we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture or sale of our 
29

Table of Contents
products, and could necessitate the expenditure of significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property.
​
We may need to pursue lawsuits or legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain names, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If third parties prepare and file applications for trademarks used or registered by us, we may oppose those applications and be required to participate in proceedings to determine the priority of rights to the trademark. Similarly, competitors may have filed applications for patents, may have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or technology that block or compete with ours. We may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of invention and the right to a patent for the technology. Litigation and interference proceedings, even if they are successful, are expensive to pursue and time consuming, and we could use a substantial amount of our management and financial resources in either case.
​
Confidentiality agreements to which we are party may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and processes could allow our competitors to limit or eliminate any competitive advantages we may have.
​
Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. Further, the implementation of new accounting pronouncements or a change in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our financial results.
​
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
​
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For example, our revenue recognition, loss accrual for service contracts, goodwill and impairment of long-lived assets policies are complex, and we often must make estimates and assumptions that could prove to be incorrect. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories, loss accrual for service contracts, impairment of long-lived assets, and provision for common stock warrants. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
​
Our products use, or generate, flammable fuels that are inherently dangerous substances, which could subject our business to product safety, product liability, other claims, product recalls, negative publicity, or heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products.
​
Our fuel cell systems use hydrogen gas in catalytic reactions. While our products do not use this fuel in a combustion process, hydrogen gas is a flammable fuel that could leak and combust if ignited by another source. Further, any such accidents involving our products or other products using similar flammable fuels could materially suppress demand for, or heighten regulatory scrutiny of, our products. Our expansion into electrolyzer manufacturing, hydrogen production, and the transport of hydrogen fuel similarly involve hydrogen in either gaseous or liquified form. Additionally, the production of hydrogen through electrolysis also results in the generation of oxygen. As a result, oxygen must be separated and controlled during the hydrogen production process. Such activities are subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with flammable gases.
​
30

Table of Contents
The risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of fuel cell products, electrolyzers, hydrogen production, and in products fueled by hydrogen, which is a flammable gas. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions or design defects could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, an actual or perceived problem with our products could adversely affect the market’s perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies”.
​
Our success depends on our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and execute our business strategy.
​
If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our future financial performance and success depend in large part on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or be able to continue improving our operating results. In particular, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute our ongoing, or any future, investments, achieve operating cost savings targeted through focused improvements and capacity optimization, including improvements to service performance through scale of manufacturing and vertical integration, and opportunistically pursue strategic transactions. Implementation of our business strategy may be impacted by factors outside of our control, including competition, commodity price fluctuations, industry, legal and regulatory changes or developments and general economic and political conditions. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.
​
Although we have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake productivity and manufacturing system and process transformation initiatives to improve service performance, we cannot assure you that all of these initiatives will be completed or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be fully realized. Even when we are able to generate new efficiencies in the short- to medium-term, we may not be able to continue to reduce costs and increase productivity over the long-term. There can be no assurance if and when any of these initiatives will be successfully and fully executed or completed.
​
D. REGULATORY RISKS
​
The funding of the loan guarantee from the Department of Energy may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the Department of Energy to receive the loan guarantee.
​
As previously announced, the Company received a conditional commitment for an up to $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the DOE Loan Programs Office to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities. Our ability to benefit from this loan guarantee is subject to certain technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions, including negotiation of definitive financing documents, to be satisfied before funding of the loan guarantee. Whether and when our DOE loan guarantee will be funded is subject to a number of factors outside of our control, including political administration changes, legislative enactments, administrative actions. The funding of such loan guarantee may take longer than we expect, and if we are not able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan guarantee, our business may be adversely affected.
​
The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy technologies, or the failure to renew such subsidies and incentives, could reduce demand for our products, lead to a reduction in our revenues, and adversely impact our operating results and liquidity. The Company’s ability to benefit from these subsidies and incentives is not guaranteed.
​
We believe that the near-term growth of alternative energy technologies will be affected by the availability and size of government and economic incentives. Many of these government incentives expire, phase out over time, may be reduced or discontinued, no longer have available funding, may be implemented differently by changes in administrative agencies, or require renewal by the applicable authority. For example, the IRA contained hundreds of billions in credits and incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, EVs and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions. The IRA contains numerous tax incentives relevant to us, 
31

Table of Contents
including: (i) the Section 45V Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen, which provides a production tax credit of up to $3 per kg of qualified clean hydrogen over a 10-year credit period for the production of qualified clean hydrogen at a qualified facility in the United States; (ii) the extension and amendment of the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) through 2024 for fuel cells and energy storage property; (iii) and the new Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which provides a tax credit for investment in facilities that generate “zero emissions” electricity or store energy, among other provisions. In the more than two years since enactment, numerous rulemakings have imposed additional, and sometime unanticipated, strictures on IRA incentives. As discussed below, the impact of these regulatory requirements – namely the Company’s ability to qualify for IRA incentives, is still not fully known. Further, it is uncertain how the new political administration will interpret and implement the IRA – in particular, for recently published regulations immediately predating the change in political administration. The Trump administration may seek to jettison recently promulgated regulations, and further, Congress may similarly seek to review certain Biden administration regulations or entirely repeal enactments and programs under the IRA or the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (“IIJA”). Relatedly, the Trump administration’s executive orders suspending disbursements under the IRA and/or IIJA may have materially adverse impact on the Company. The scope and impact of this executive order are unknown; however, the Company has substantially relied upon numerous tentative forms of federal incentives under the IRA and/or IIJA, including but not limited to grants for R&D activities, programmatic funding, and direct pay tax incentives. Depending upon the breath of implementation, the executive order could have a materially adverse impact on the Company.
​
The Company’s ability to ultimately benefit from IRA tax credits and incentives is not guaranteed and is dependent upon its ability to comply with the federal government’s implementation, guidance, rulemakings, and/or regulations or such incentives and programs. For example, there is no guarantee that the Company’s projects will comply with the final Section 45V regulations promulgated in December 2025 – in particular, temporal matching, incrementality, and regionality limitations on the use of renewable energy credits and environmental attributes. 
​
Similarly, the Company’s fuel cell products may not qualify for any investment tax credit. The final regulations for the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit provide onerous strictures for fuel cell credit eligibility – namely compliance with the credit’s “zero emissions” criteria, which could likely require a fuel cell’s exclusive use of electrolytic hydrogen. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to comply with Section 48E’s proposed standards for fuel cells. The effect of the final regulations on our business is not yet known but if we are not able to comply with the final eligibility requirements and our competitors are able to do so, our business may be adversely affected. Concurrently, the preexisting Section 48 ITC was only available for fuel cells projects beginning construction before January 1, 2025. There is no guarantee that Congress will seek to extend the recently expired Section 48 ITC for fuel cells. As a result of the Section 48E final regulations, compounded with the expiration of the Sectio 48 ITC for fuel cells, no federal investment tax credit may be available for the Company’s fuel cell products. 
​
Furthermore, political administration changes, future legislative enactments, administrative actions, expiration or changes to clean energy tax credits, policies or other incentives might be more favorable to other technologies or could limit, amend, repeal, or terminate policies or other incentives that the Company currently hopes to leverage, such as the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office Loan Guarantee. For example, the Section 48 ITC for qualified fuel cell properties expired for fuel cell properties beginning construction after December 31, 2024, and as a result, there is no guarantee that Plug’s fuel cell product will qualify for any federal tax credit thereafter. Any reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application of expiration of tax incentives or other government subsidies and economic incentives, or the failure to renew such tax credits, governmental subsidies, or economic incentives, may result in the diminished economic competitiveness of our products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect the growth of alternative energy technologies, including our products, as well as our future operating results and liquidity.
​
Changes in U.S. or foreign trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes as well as geopolitical conditions and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry. Our business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our manufacturers, component suppliers, and other business partners are located. For example, geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, any potential worsening or expansion of these conflicts and wars, and U.S.-China relations, could impact supply chains, trade and movement of resources and the price of commodities and affect our ability to obtain raw materials. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the occurrence or threat of wars or 
32

Table of Contents
other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, further escalation of these geopolitical conflicts, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, , further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, further disruptions to the global supply chain and other adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions. 
​
Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other measures, such as taxes or controls on imports or exports of goods, which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain. For example, effective February 4, 2025, the U.S. government implemented an additional tariff on goods being imported from China and announced additional tariffs for goods imported into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada beginning in March 2025. The Company cannot predict what additional changes to trade policy will be made by the presidential administration or Congress, including whether existing tariff policies will be maintained or modified, what products may be subject to such policies or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can the Company predict the effects that any such changes would have on its business. However, such steps, if adopted, could increase the Company’s costs and adversely impact its business and operations. In addition, changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted, and could again result, in reactions from U.S. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies. For example, in response to the U.S. government’s additional tariff on imports from China, on February 4, 2025, the Chinese government announced that it would implement a tariff on certain goods being imported into China from the U.S. These changes in U.S. trade policy or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
​
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations that could impose significant costs and liabilities on us and impact our business practices, including climate change and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) reporting requirements.
Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, product safety, emissions of pollution into the environment, and human health and safety. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with these laws and regulations. These costs and obligations are likely to expand and change as our Company grows, makes acquisitions, and conducts business in new locations. Furthermore, federal, state, and local governments are increasingly regulating and restricting the use of certain chemicals, substances, and materials. Some of these policy initiatives could foreseeably be impactful to our business. For example, laws, regulations, or other policy initiatives might address substances found within component parts to our products, in which event our Company would be required to comply with such requirements.
​
Our facilities in the U.S. are subject to regulation by OSHA, which regulates the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local residents. We are also subject to occupational safety regulations in other countries. Our failure to comply with government occupational safety regulations, including OSHA requirements, or general industry standards relating to employee health and safety, keep adequate records or monitor occupational exposure to regulated substances could expose us to liability, enforcement, and fines and penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Violation of these laws or regulations or the occurrence of an explosion or other accident in connection with our fuel cell systems at our properties or at third party locations could lead to injuries, property damage, litigation, substantial liabilities and sanctions, including fines and penalties, cleanup costs, manufacturing delays or the requirement to undertake corrective action. Further, environmental laws and human health and safety and regulations, and the administration, interpretation, and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Each of these considerations is further magnified by our expansion into new regulatory jurisdictions with which we may be unfamiliar.
​
Additionally, certain environmental laws impose liability, which can be joint and several, as well as strict, on current and previous owners and operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and damage to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was 
33

Table of Contents
not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. They can also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated, and such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. Our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
​
Corporate responsibility practices and ratings are important to some investors and other stakeholders who may have differing and conflicting views as to their preferred approach to corporate responsibility matters. Expectations regarding corporate responsibility may impact our business practices and the price of our securities. Changing practices have in the past and may in the future include expanded mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, inclusion and diversity, labor, and risk oversight, and these could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report on, which may prove difficult, expensive and time consuming. In addition, the adoption of increased government regulations and changes in investor preference related to corporate responsibility matters may result in changes to our business practices, including increasing expenses or capital expenditures. We have communicated certain initiatives regarding ESG matters and we may in the future communicate revised or additional initiatives. If our initiatives are unsuccessful or we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees and other stakeholders, our reputation could be adversely affected. In recent years, corporate initiatives relating to ESG matters, including workplace diversity, equity and inclusion, have attracted negative commentary and regulatory attention in the broader business sector. Legislation, regulatory initiatives, litigation, legal opinions, federal executive orders and increased scrutiny related to corporate responsibility matters could expose the Company to additional compliance obligations, costs, and potential liabilities.
​
We acknowledge the significant challenge presented by climate change, and see our transformational work in developing cost-effective, renewable hydrogen, and fuel cell energy as part of the solution. Our commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted in our products, mission, core values, and people. However, we acknowledge that climate change will potentially have wide-ranging impacts, including potential impacts to our Company. Unanticipated environmental, societal, economic, or geopolitical effects of climate change might affect business operations. For example, increasingly severe and frequent weather events might disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect our customers. Relatedly, government policies addressing climate change could similarly impact our business operations. There is no guarantee that such potential changes in laws, regulations, or policies will be favorable to our Company, our technologies, to existing or future customers, or to large-scale economic, environmental, or geopolitical conditions.
​
Our business is subject to government regulation.
​
Our products are subject to certain federal, state, local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including, for example, state and local ordinances relating to building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections, hydrogen transportation and siting and related matters. See Item 1, “Business — Government Regulations” for additional information. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Further, as products are introduced into the market commercially, governments may impose new regulations. We do not know the extent to which any such regulations may impact our ability to manufacture, distribute, install and service our products. Any regulation of our products, whether at the federal, state, local or foreign level, including any regulations relating to the production, operation, installation, and servicing of our products may increase our costs and the price of our products, and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. Furthermore, certain business activities may require the Company to navigate a myriad of state or local-level laws and regulations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
​
There is no guarantee that local, state, federal, or international jurisdictions will adopt laws, regulations and policies that are favorable to hydrogen or fuel cell technologies. As various jurisdictions pursue climate change and decarbonization policies, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and oversight.
​

Table of Contents
Changes in tax laws or regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
​
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. A number of factors may adversely affect our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; the availability of loss or credit carryforwards to offset taxable income; changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof; or examinations by U.S. federal, state or foreign jurisdictions that disagree with interpretations of tax rules and regulations in regard to positions taken on tax filings. A change in any of our effective tax rates due to any of these factors may adversely affect the carrying value of our tax assets and our future results from operations.
​
In addition, as our business grows, we are required to comply with increasingly complex taxation rules and practices. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and in foreign tax jurisdictions as we expand internationally, which requires additional expertise to ensure compliance with various domestic and international tax laws. The development of our global tax footprint and compliance with these laws may impact how we conduct our business and affect our financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
​
The changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of net operating losses (“NOLs”) may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs. 
​
Changes in U.S. federal income or other tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act, as passed by Congress in August 2022, may impact our tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal NOL carryforwards of $3.0 billion, which begin to expire in various amounts and at various dates in 2033 through 2037 (other than federal NOL carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017, which are not subject to expiration). As of December 31, 2024, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $24.7 million, which begin to expire in 2033. Utilization of our NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation if the ownership change limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and similar state provisions are triggered by changes in our ownership. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of the Company by “5-percent shareholders” that exceed 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Based on studies of the changes in ownership of the Company, it has been determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred in 2013 that limited the amount of pre-change NOLs that can be used in future years. NOLs incurred after the most recent ownership change are not subject to Section 382 of the Code and are available for use in future years. If we undergo any ownership changes, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Any such limitation may significantly reduce our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards. 
​
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act modified, among other things, rules governing NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the NOLs into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five year carryback and indefinite carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. In future years, if and when the valuation allowance related to our NOLs is partially or fully released, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017. 
​
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.
​
Our contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our offerings to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, an increasing 
35

Table of Contents
portion of our operating revenues and operating expenses are earned or incurred outside of the United States, and an increasing portion of our assets are held outside of the United States. These operating revenues, expenses, and assets are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be adversely affected.
​
Additionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including regional conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, trade tariff developments, and inflation have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. 
We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, so we 
may not be able to effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our operating results.
​
E. STRATEGIC RISKS
​
We may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties for certain aspects of continued product developments, manufacturing, distribution, sale, servicing, and supply components for our products.
​
We will need to maintain and may need to enter into additional strategic relationships in order to complete our current development and commercialization plans regarding our fuel cell products, electrolyzers, hydrogen production, and potential new business markets. We may also require partners to assist in the sale, servicing, and supply of components for our current and anticipated products and projects, which are in development. If we are unable to identify, negotiate, enter into, and maintain satisfactory agreements with partners, including those relating to the supply, distribution, service and support of our current and anticipated products and projects, we may not be able to complete our product development and commercialization plans on schedule or at all. We may also need to scale back these plans in the absence of needed partners, which could adversely affect our future prospects for development and commercialization of future products and projects. While we have entered into relationships with suppliers of some key components for our products, we do not know when or whether we will secure supply relationships for all required components and subsystems for our products, or whether such relationships will be on terms that will allow us to achieve our objectives. Our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed if we fail to secure and maintain relationships with entities that can develop or supply the required components for our products and provide the required distribution and servicing support. Additionally, the agreements governing our current relationships allow for termination by our partners under certain circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. If any agreements with our partners were to terminate, there could be a material adverse impact on the continued development and profitable commercialization of our products and the operation of our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
​
We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets or properties, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, and impair our financial results.
​
From time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies, or products, or enter into strategic initiatives, which may enhance our capabilities, expand our manufacturing network, complement our current offerings, or expand the breadth of our markets. For example, in 2021, we acquired Applied Cryo Technologies, Inc., which added significant capabilities, expertise, and technologies, including a liquid hydrogen delivery network and fleet, liquid hydrogen storage, and hydrogen mobility fueling, and Frames Holding B.V. (“Frames”), which added engineering, process, and systems integration expertise, enabling us to scale the delivery of green hydrogen solutions. In addition, in 2022, we acquired Joule Processing LLC (“Joule”), whose cryogenic process technology we adopted to efficiently liquefy hydrogen by leveraging advanced cooling processes at low temperatures.
​
Entering into acquisitions and investments and other strategic initiatives involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among other things:
​
●
expenses, delays, or difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses, facilities, technologies, products, operations, and existing contracts of a target company, including the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses;
36

Table of Contents
●
expending significant cash or incurring substantial debt to finance acquisitions, which indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments;
●
mistaken assumptions about volumes or the timing of those volumes, revenues or costs, including synergies;
●
negative perception of the acquisition by customers, financial markets or investors; 
●
difficulty in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company; 
●
inability to achieve anticipated synergies or increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business; 
●
the assumption of unknown liabilities;
●
exposure to potential lawsuits;
●
limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;
●
the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns; 
●
unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas;
●
customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses;
●
the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize; or 
●
the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs. 
​
Our failure to successfully complete or integrate such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to successfully grow through strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable target businesses, facilities, technologies, and products and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions or strategic relationships we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such transactions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, facilities, technologies, or products into our business or retain any key personnel or suppliers. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted. As a result, if our forecasted assumptions for these acquisitions and investments are not accurate, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we had anticipated.
​
F. RISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
​
Our stock price and stock trading volume have been and could remain volatile, and the value of your investment could decline and if securities analysts do not maintain coverage of us or if they publish unfavorable or inaccurate research or reports about our business, our stock, or our industry, the price of our stock and the trading volume could decline. 
​
The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. During 2023 and 2024, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $18.88 per share to a low of $1.60 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in securities analysts’ recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, including one or more of our strategic partners, events relating to our determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Furthermore, technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors.

For example, we are subject to securities class action litigation filed after a drop in the price in our common stock in March 2021 and March 2023, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
​
We expect that the trading market for our common stock will be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. There are many large, well-established companies active in our industry and portions of the markets in which we compete, which may mean that we receive less widespread analyst coverage than 
37

Table of Contents
our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades their evaluations or lowers their expectations of our Company, our stock, or our industry, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.
​
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us. 
​
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately (i) 33,049,906 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes at a conversion price of $4.25 per share, (ii) 11,611,699 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes at a conversion price of $5.03 per share and (iii) 61,206,897 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Convertible Debenture at a conversion price of $2.90 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 38,690,148 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $8.64 per share and 82,022,634 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, of which 98,296,804 were vested as of December 31, 2024.
​
Moreover, subject to market conditions and other factors, we may issue shares of common stock, or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock, in connection with a financing, acquisition, employee arrangement or otherwise. Any such issuance, including pursuant to any at-the-market agreements, such as the at-the-market offering program that we entered into with B. Riley Securities, Inc., or any line of equity, such as the standby equity purchase agreement that we entered with YA II PN, LTD, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.
​
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the conversion of the notes or preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and future equity issuances will result in dilution to investors. The market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to an increased number of shares available for sale in the market.
​
Provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law may discourage or delay an acquisition of the Company by a third party that stockholders may consider favorable and may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a forum a stockholder finds favorable.
​
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. These provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election of directors. These provisions include, but are not limited to: the ability of our Board to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the terms of those shares, including preference and voting rights, without a stockholder vote; the exclusive right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board; the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; the prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; advance notice informational and procedural requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing business to be brought before a stockholder meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; a prohibition against stockholders nominating a number of their own nominees at the annual meeting of the stockholders that exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such annual meeting; the ability of our Board, by majority vote and without shareholder approval, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and staggered terms for our directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders.
​
In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of, or a claim based on, a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The amended and restated bylaws further provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.
​
We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.

​
Because the choice of forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of severing certain causes of action between federal and state courts, stockholders seeking to assert claims against us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder, may be discouraged from bringing such claims due to a possibility of increased litigation expenses arising from litigating multiple related claims in two separate courts. The choice of forum provisions may therefore limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Cybersecurity Risk Management
​
We face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business and recognize the growing threat within the general marketplace and our industry. In the ordinary course of our business, we use, store, and process data, including data of our employees, partners, collaborators, and vendors. Cybersecurity threats and incidents include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and networks, or our partners, collaborators, vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business, to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential or personal information and other cybersecurity breaches. We consider cybersecurity risk a serious threat to our business. To help the Company identify, assess, and mitigate risks to this data and our systems, 
we have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program 
that is informed by recognized industry standards and frameworks and incorporates elements of the same.

Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a number of components, including information security program assessments and continuous monitoring of critical risks from cybersecurity threats using automated tools. 
We periodically engage third parties to conduct risk assessments on our systems, including penetration testing and other vulnerability analyses
. In 2024, Plug continued to fortify its comprehensive cybersecurity and risk controls. We maintain an insider threat program designed to identify, assess, and address potential risks from within our Company and evaluate potential risks consistent with industry practices, customer requirements, and applicable law, including privacy and other considerations. We mandated an annual cybersecurity awareness training module, enhanced our Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) based discipline of change and incident management, and overhauled our monthly patching/vulnerability management rigor. Additionally, Plug continued leveraging top-tier third party support for external and perimeter examination: completing exhaustive Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scans (performed by OrbitalFire), establishing a robust Network Operations Center (NOC), and leveraging industry-leading endpoint monitoring and detection services (CrowdStrike). Additionally, we have implemented an employee education program whereby employees are able to attend cybersecurity awareness training during the onboarding process.
​
Governance
​
The 
Vice President of Information Technology
 (“
VP of IT
”) oversees the daily operations of our cybersecurity risk management program and plays a central role in assessing and managing critical risks from cybersecurity threats with the support of additional IT professionals. 
The VP of IT role is currently held by an individual who has approximately twenty years of experience in information security management, application portfolio management, and IT governance, risk, and compliance.

The VP of IT periodically 
reports
 on the cybersecurity program to the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
​
Our governance framework includes oversight by the 
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
. 
The Audit Committee meets quarterly with the CFO regarding the cybersecurity risk management program, including as relates to critical cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity initiatives and strategies. Additionally, on an annual basis, the VP of IT reports the current state of cybersecurity risk management to the full Board of Directors.
 The Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management.
​
Although we have designed our cybersecurity program and governance procedures above to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we have experienced, and we may in the future experience, threats to and breaches of our data and systems, including ransomware attacks and phishing attacks. 
To date, these risks, threats or attacks have not had a material impact on our operations
, business strategy or financial results, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have a material impact in the future. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled “We are dependent on information technology in our operations, and the failure of such technology may adversely affect our business. Security breaches of our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, or use of malware or phishing or other malicious techniques by threat actors, have in the past and could in the future lead to liability, impact our operations, or damage our reputation and financial results” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
