Overview 
​
Plug is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly electrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions.
​
While we continue to develop commercially viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions, we have 
expanded our offerings to support a variety of commercial operations that can be powered with clean hydrogen. We provide electrolyzers that allow customers — such as refineries, producers of chemicals, steel, fertilizer and commercial refueling stations — to generate hydrogen on-site
. 
We are focusing our efforts on (a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) production of hydrogen; and (c) stationary power systems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and generation facilities, in either a backup power or continuous power role, and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for telecommunication logistics, transportation, and utility customers. Plug expects to support these products and customers with an ecosystem of vertically integrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for mobility and power applications.
​
Our current product and service portfolio includes: 
​
GenDrive
: GenDrive is our hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell system, providing power to material handling EVs, including Class 1, 2, 3 and 6 electric forklifts, automated guided vehicles, and ground support equipment.
​
GenSure
: GenSure is our stationary fuel cell solution providing scalable, modular PEM fuel cell power to support the backup and grid-support power requirements of the telecommunications, transportation, and utility sectors; our GenSure High Power Fuel Cell Platform supports large scale stationary power and data center markets.
​
Progen
: Progen is our fuel cell stack and engine technology currently used globally in mobility and stationary fuel cell systems. This includes Plug’s membrane electrode assembly (“MEA”), a critical component of the fuel cell stack used in zero-emission fuel cell systems.
​
GenFuel
: GenFuel is our liquid hydrogen fueling, delivery, generation, storage, and dispensing system.
​
GenCare
: GenCare is our ongoing “Internet of Things”-based maintenance and on-site service program for GenDrive fuel cell systems, GenSure fuel cell systems, GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products and Progen fuel cell engines. 
​
GenKey
: GenKey is our vertically integrated “turn-key” solution combining either GenDrive or GenSure fuel cell power with GenFuel fuel and GenCare aftermarket service, offering complete simplicity to customers transitioning to fuel cell power.

Electrolyzers
: The design and implementation of 5MW and 10MW electrolyzer systems that are modular, scalable hydrogen generators optimized for clean hydrogen production. Electrolyzers generate hydrogen from water using electricity and a special membrane and “green” hydrogen is generated by using renewable energy inputs, such as solar or wind power.
​
Liquefaction Systems
: Plug’s 15 ton-per-day and 30 ton-per-day liquefiers are engineered for high efficiency, reliability, and operational flexibility — providing consistent liquid hydrogen to customers. This design increases plant reliability and availability while minimizing parasitic losses like heat leak and seal gas losses. 
​
Cryogenic Equipment:
 E
ngineered equipment including trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquified hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.
​
Liquid Hydrogen:
 Liquid hydrogen provides an efficient fuel alternative to fossil-based energy. We produce liquid hydrogen through our electrolyzer systems and liquefaction systems. Liquid hydrogen supply will be used by customers in material handling operations, fuel cell electric vehicle fleets, and stationary power applications.
​
We provide our products and solutions worldwide through our direct sales force, and by leveraging relationships with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealer networks. Plug is currently targeting Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East and North America for expansion in adoption. The European Union (the “EU”) has rolled out ambitious targets for the hydrogen economy, with the United Kingdom also taking steps in this direction, and Plug is seeking to execute on our strategy to become one of the European leaders in the hydrogen economy. This includes a targeted account strategy for material handling, securing strategic partnerships with European OEMs, energy companies, utility leaders and accelerating our electrolyzer business.

Operating Activities
​
The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $728.6 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. This decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to cash inflows related to the Company’s accounts receivables and inventory, partially offset by an increase in net loss, a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue and other contract liabilities.
​
Investing Activities
​
The net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was ($402.4) million and $728.1 million, respectively. The change from cash inflow to cash outflow from investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities during the year ended December 31, 2024 as the Company no longer holds available-for-sale securities.
​
Financing Activities
​
The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $983.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds from the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, as amended (as described below), with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”) 
45

Table of Contents
and proceeds from the convertible debenture during the year ended December 31, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from finance obligations.
​
The Company has continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses of approximately $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $724.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s working capital was $729.0 million at December 31, 2024, which included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $205.7 million and current restricted cash of $198.0 million.
​
The future use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of our businesses, the optimal allocation of our resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of capital, market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time and at terms favorable to the Company.
​
The Company has an “at-the-market” equity offering program with B. Riley pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell through or to B. Riley, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion under a sales agreement. The Company has the right at its sole discretion to direct B. Riley to act on a principal basis and purchase directly from the Company up to $11.0 million of shares of its common stock on any trading day if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $1.0 billion (or up to $10.0 million if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion) and up to $55.0 million of shares in any calendar week if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $1.0 billion (or up to $30.0 million if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion). On February 23, 2024 and November 7, 2024, the Company and B. Riley amended the at-the-market equity program to increase the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock available for issuance under the program to $1.0 billion. The amended program will terminate upon the earliest of (a) December 31, 2025 with respect to principal transactions and January 17, 2026 with respect to agency transactions, (b) the sale of all shares of common stock under the program or (c) termination of the sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 219,835,221 shares of its common stock at a weighted-average sales price of $3.08 per share for net proceeds of $666.9 million under the ATM agreement. 
​
On July 22, 2024, the Company sold 78,740,157 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $2.54 per share for net proceeds of $191.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount and related offering expenses.
​
On November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Debenture Purchase Agreement (the “Debenture Purchase Agreement”) with YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (“Yorkville”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Yorkville an unsecured convertible debenture in aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million in exchange for the payment of $190.0 million. For more information, see Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”.
​
In addition, on February 10, 2025, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with Yorkville (the “SEPA”), pursuant to which the Company has the right, at its option, to sell to Yorkville up to $1.0 billion in the aggregate gross sales of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth therein. The Company has the right, but not the obligation, from time to time at its sole discretion to direct Yorkville to purchase directly from the Company up to $10.0 million shares of its common stock on any trading day.
​
On March 3, 2025, the Company announced the 2025 Restructuring Plan. The 2025 Restructuring Plan includes initiatives to reduce our workforce, realign the Company’s manufacturing footprint and streamline the organization to enhance operational efficiency and improve overall liquidity. The expected annual savings from the 2025 Restructuring Plan are expected to be significant and will begin to be realized beginning in the second half of 2025.
​
The Company believes that its working capital, cash position and restricted cash to be released over the next 12 months, together with its right to direct B. Riley to purchase shares from the Company under the “at-the-market” equity offering program and its right to direct Yorkville to purchase shares from the Company under the SEPA, will be sufficient to fund its on-going operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

As part of the settlement, the Company paid a civil monetary penalty to the SEC in the amount of $1.25 million on September 20, 2023. On August 30, 2024, the Company certified with the SEC staff that the Company completed the undertakings set forth in the SEC settlement, which included fully remediating its material weaknesses. After reviewing the evidence of compliance provided by the Company, the SEC found that the evidence provided satisfied the undertaking requirement.
​
Restructuring Plans
​
In February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance the Company’s financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a competitive market, the Company approved the 2024 Restructuring Plan, a comprehensive initiative that encompassed a broad range of measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions. In March 2025, the Company approved another initiative, the 2025 Restructuring Plan, which included initiatives to reduce the Company’s workforce, realign the Company’s manufacturing footprint and streamline the organization to enhance operational efficiency and improve overall liquidity. The expected annual savings from the 2025 Restructuring Plan are expected to be significant and will begin to be realized beginning in the second half of 2025.
​
Department of Energy Loan Guarantee
​
On May 14, 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (the “DOE”) issued a conditional commitment letter to the Company and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company for a loan guarantee of up to $1.66 billion through the DOE’s Loan Programs Office to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities. On January 16, 2025, the Company closed its loan guarantee from the DOE that is intended to support the Company’s domestic hydrogen production plant buildout. The approval and funding of any disbursements of the loan guarantee will be subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, evidence of satisfaction

of certain technical and performance related conditions precedent, adequate project funding, reports from certain technical consultants and advisors, and the receipt of certain financial models demonstrating compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the loan guarantee agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such a loan or on terms that are acceptable to the Company. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, for a description of risks related to the DOE loan guarantee.
​
Inflation, Material Availability and Labor Shortages 
​
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources; however, we believe there are some component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, particularly those suppliers and vendors that supply materials in very limited supply worldwide or supply commodities that have a high degree of volatility, whose loss to us or general unavailability could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. For example, although we believe the liquid hydrogen supply challenges of the past may have lessened in recent months, we may again experience similar challenges relating to the availability of hydrogen, including but not limited to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts as they have in the past, which could negatively impact the amount of hydrogen we are able to provide under certain of our hydrogen supply agreements and other customer agreements. Furthermore, global commodity pricing has been volatile and has been influenced by political events and worldwide economic trends, which has impacted our sourcing strategies, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and financial condition. We have mitigated and are continuing to mitigate these risks by continuing to diversify our supply chain, including diversifying our global supply chain and implementing alternate system architectures that we expect will allow us to source from multiple fuel cell, electrolyzer stack and air supply component vendors. While we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components, insourcing and localized manufacturing when feasible, we are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, product and sales forecasting, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. However, ongoing changes to, and evolution of, our products designs such as simultaneous design/build efforts and new product serviceability trends, or incorrect forecasting or updates to previously forecasted volumes could present challenges to those strategies despite best efforts in leveraging supplier relationships and capabilities. With respect to production, although cost pressures from global energy prices and inflation have been less volatile than previous years, an increase in cost pressures or a rise in inflation could negatively affect our business again, which could have a pricing impact on our key raw materials. We have a regionally diverse supply chain, and in cases where we have single sourced suppliers (typically due to new technology and products or worldwide shortages due to global demand), we work to engineer alternatives in our product design or develop new supply sources while covering short- and medium-term risks with supply contracts, building up inventory, and development partnerships. However, if we are unable to reduce such inventory, that could tie up working capital.
​
We continue to take proactive steps through our supply chain team to limit the impact of supplier challenges generally and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and transportation vendors to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we have continued discussions with suppliers with respect to the terms of our supply agreements, and the outcome of such discussions, including whether those discussions yield the desired modifications in the terms of such supply agreements, may impact the timing of when we receive shipments of certain supplies or result in other supply chain issues.
​
With respect to our service business, we have experienced inflationary increases in labor, parts and related overhead. This has contributed to the increase in our estimated projected costs to service fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, which resulted in an increase in the provision for loss contracts related to service. If these trends continue, we may have to record additional service loss provisions in the future. We anticipate bookings and revenue will be uneven in the near-term while we pursue sales opportunities.
​
Additionally, we, as well as our suppliers and vendors, have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Tight labor markets have resulted in longer times to fill open positions for us and our suppliers and vendors. Increased employee turnover, reassessment of employee responsibilities given current business needs, changes in the availability of our workers as well as labor shortages have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs which could negatively affect our component or raw material purchasing abilities, and in turn, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
​

Table of Contents
Results of Operations
​
Our primary sources of revenue are from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other, services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, power purchase agreements, and fuel delivered to customers and related equipment. A certain portion of our sales result from acquisitions in legacy markets, which we are working to transition to renewable solutions. Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, cryogenic stationary and on road storage, hydrogen liquefaction systems, electrolyzers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. Revenue from power purchase agreements primarily represent payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company’s GenKey solution. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers and related equipment represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production plants.
​
Provision for Common Stock Warrants
​
On August 24, 2022, the Company issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon (“Amazon”), a warrant (the “Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 16,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events described below under “Common Stock Transactions – Amazon Transaction Agreement in 2022”.
​
In 2017, in separate transactions, the Company issued a warrant to each of Amazon and Walmart to purchase up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events described below under “Common Stock Transactions – Amazon Transaction Agreement in 2017” and “Common Stock Transactions – Walmart Transaction Agreement”. The Company recorded a portion of the estimated fair value of the warrants as a reduction of revenue based upon the projected number of shares of common stock expected to vest under the warrants, the proportion of purchases by Amazon, Walmart and their affiliates within the period relative to the aggregate purchase levels required for vesting of the respective warrants, and the then-current fair value of the warrants.
​
The amount of provision for the Amazon and Walmart warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is shown in the table below (in thousands):

Revenue —

sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other
. Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, cryogenic stationary and on road storage, hydrogen liquefaction systems, electrolyzers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure referred to at the site level as hydrogen installations.

Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $321.1 million, or 45.1%, to $390.3 million from $711.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in revenue related to hydrogen site installations, liquefiers, cryogenic equipment, and fuel cell systems. The decrease in the revenue related to sales of cryogenic storage equipment and liquefiers of $120.2 million was primarily due to product mix with respect to cryogenic equipment, fewer projects and a slower rate of progress on existing liquefier projects as they near completion compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue related to sales of fuel cell systems decreased $129.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of GenDrive units sold, with 3,119 units sold during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 6,392 units sold during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in hydrogen infrastructure revenue of $114.5 million was primarily due to volume, with 15 hydrogen site installations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 52 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, there was a decrease of $10.3 million related to the sales of engineered oil and gas equipment from the Frames acquisition, for which sales are not expected to continue beyond current commitments. Furthermore, the pace of development of the hydrogen economy has been slower than anticipated and has impacted hydrogen equipment deployments. Finally, there was an increase in the provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue, which increased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenue related to electrolyzers of $53.0 million, primarily due to 153 one megawatt equivalent units sold for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 133 one megawatt equivalent units sold for the year ended December 31, 2023. Included in the 153 one megawatt equivalent units sold for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 29 electrolyzer systems sold compared to two electrolyzer systems sold during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Income 
Tax
es
​
The Company recorded $2.7 million of income tax benefit and $7.4 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to an incremental change to the valuation allowance recorded in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the U.S., which remain fully reserved. Except for a few service entities mainly in Europe, all deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s Netherlands subsidiary established a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets that will not be realized.
​
The domestic net deferred tax asset generated from the Company’s net operating loss has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforward will not be realized. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax expense.

6.00% Convertible Debenture
​
On November 11, 2024, the Company entered into the Debenture Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued to Yorkville a convertible debenture (the “6.00% Convertible Debenture”) in exchange for the payment of $190.0 million. The 6.00% Convertible Debenture was issued in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The 6.00% Convertible Debenture ranks pari passu in right of payment with all other outstanding and future senior indebtedness of the Company.

The 6.00% Convertible Debenture bears interest at a rate of 6.00% per annum and is payable on the second year anniversary of the issuance date of the 6.00% Convertible Debenture (the “Maturity Date”) or earlier redemption date. The interest rate will increase to a rate of 16.0% per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the 6.00% Convertible Debenture.

The 6.00% Convertible Debenture provides that Yorkville may convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the 6.00% Convertible Debenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, at an initial conversion price of $2.90 (the “Fixed Price”), representing a conversion premium of 146% to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on November 11, 2024. In certain circumstances, Yorkville will be permitted to convert up to $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Convertible Debenture plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, each calendar month beginning with December 2024, at a conversion price equal to the lower of the (1) Fixed Price and (2) 97.25% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price for the Company’s common stock during the three trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion date (the “Market Price”); provided that such Market Price is not less than $0.3941 (the “Floor Price”). The Fixed Price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including if the Company issues shares of common stock at price per share that is less than the Fixed Price or certain convertible securities with a conversion price that is less than the Fixed Price (the “Dilutive Price”), in which case the Fixed Price would be adjusted to equal the Dilutive Price, subject to certain exceptions. Yorkville is not permitted to convert the 6.00% Convertible Debenture to the extent that the shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion thereof would exceed

7.00% Convertible Senior Notes
​
On March 20, 2024, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the Company’s outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to which the Company exchanged $138.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, and accrued and unpaid interest of $1.6 million on such notes to, but excluding, March 20, 2024, for $140.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s new 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, in each case, pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. Following the exchange, approximately $58.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged.
​
This transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.0 million in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2024. Loss on extinguishment of debt arises from the difference between the net carrying amount of the Company’s debt and the fair value of the assets transferred to extinguish the debt.

The 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are governed by the terms of an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of March 20, 2024, entered into between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes bear cash interest at the rate of 7.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2024, to holders of record at the close of business on the preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively. The 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier converted or redeemed or repurchased by the Company.

​
The conversion rate for the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes is initially 235.4049 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $4.25 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 20% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 12, 2024. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2025, the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after December 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes at any time regardless of these conditions. Conversions of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be settled in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election.

​
Subject to certain exceptions and subject to certain conditions, holders of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes may require the Company to repurchase their 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) prior to maturity for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

​
The 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time on or after June 5, 2025, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the then-applicable conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the three trading days immediately preceding the date the Company sends the related redemption notice, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company sends such redemption notice.
​
In certain circumstances, conversions of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes in connection with “Make-Whole Fundamental Changes” (as defined in the Indenture) or conversions of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes called for redemption may result in an increase to the conversion rate, provided that the conversion rate will not exceed 282.4859 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes, subject to adjustment. In such circumstance, a maximum of 39,659,890 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment, may be issued upon conversion of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes. There were no conversions of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2024.

​
On May 18, 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2025 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. On May 29, 2020, the Company issued an additional $12.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. On March 12, 2024, the Company exchanged $138.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes for $140.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s new 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. Following the exchange, approximately $58.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged.
​
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. The notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.
​
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of its current or future subsidiaries.
​
Holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2024 in the following circumstances:
​
1)
during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
​
2)
during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
​
3)
if the Company calls any or all of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes for redemption, any such notes that have been called for redemption may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
​
4)
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes.
​
On or after December 1, 2024, the holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the 
58

Table of Contents
maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. There were no conversions of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
​
The initial conversion rate for the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes is 198.6196 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.03 per share of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $15.2 million of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes were converted and the Company issued approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in conjunction with these conversions.

​
In addition, following certain corporate events or following issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its notes called for redemption during the related redemption period in certain circumstances.
​
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 5, 2023 and before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the three trading days immediately preceding the date the Company sends the related redemption notice, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company sends such redemption notice. 
​
If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase their notes for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
​
The Company accounts for the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes as a liability. We incurred transaction costs related to the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes of approximately $7.0 million, consisting of initial purchasers’ discount of approximately $6.4 million and other issuance costs of $0.6 million which were recorded as debt issuance cost (presented as contra debt in the consolidated balance sheets) and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes.

The estimated fair value of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $44.9 million and $213.2 million, respectively. The fair value estimation was primarily based on a quoted price in an active market.
​
Capped Call 
​
In conjunction with the pricing of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “3.75% Notes Capped Call”) with certain counterparties at a price of $16.2 million. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call covers, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that underlie the initial 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes 
and 
is generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call is initially $6.7560 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 60%

over the last then-reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $4.11 per share on the date of the transaction and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call becomes exercisable if the conversion option is exercised.
The net cost incurred in connection with the 3.75% Notes Capped Call has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets at the time the transactions were entered into. The book value of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call is not remeasured.

Amazon Transaction Agreement in 2022
​
On August 24, 2022, the Company and Amazon entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “2022 Amazon Transaction Agreement”), under which the Company concurrently issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon, a warrant (the “2022 Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 16,000,000 shares (the “2022 Amazon Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events described below. The Company and Amazon entered into the 2022 Amazon Transaction Agreement in connection with a concurrent commercial arrangement under which Amazon agreed to purchase hydrogen fuel from the Company through August 24, 2029.
​
1,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares vested immediately upon issuance of the 2022 Amazon Warrant. 15,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will vest in multiple tranches over the 7-year term of the 2022 Amazon Warrant based on payments made to the Company directly by Amazon or its affiliates, or indirectly through third parties, with 15,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares fully vesting if Amazon-related payments of $2.1 billion are made in the aggregate. The exercise price for the first 9,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares is $22.9841 per share and the fair value on the grant date was $20.36. The exercise price for the remaining 7,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will be an amount per share equal to 90% of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the Company’s common stock as of the final vesting event that results in full vesting of the first 9,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares. The 2022 Amazon Warrant is exercisable through August 24, 2029. 
​
Upon the consummation of certain change of control transactions (as defined in the 2022 Amazon Warrant) prior to the vesting of at least 60% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, the 2022 Amazon Warrant will automatically vest and become exercisable with respect to an additional number of 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares such that 60% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares shall have vested. If a change of control transaction is consummated after the vesting of at least 60% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, then no acceleration of vesting will occur with respect to any of the unvested 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares as a result of the transaction. The exercise price and the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the 2022 Amazon Warrant are subject to customary antidilution adjustments. 
​
On August 24, 2022, 1,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares associated with tranche 1 vested. The warrant fair value associated with the vested shares of tranche 1 of $20.4 million was capitalized to contract assets based on the grant date fair value and is subsequently amortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 1 was $16.5 million which is recorded in contract assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. During the second quarter of 2023, all 1,000,000 of the Amazon Warrant Shares associated with tranche 2 vested. The warrant fair value 
60

Table of Contents
associated with the vested shares of tranche 2 was $20.4 million and was determined on the grant date of August 24, 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 2 was $16.5 million. Tranche 3 will vest over the next $1.0 billion of collections from Amazon and its affiliates. The grant date fair value of tranche 3 will also be amortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 3 was $0.2 million. Because the exercise price has yet to be determined, if probable of vesting, the fair value of tranche 4 will be remeasured at each reporting period end and amortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 3,000,000 and 2,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares had vested, respectively, and none of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares had been exercised. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2022 Amazon Warrant during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $19.0 million, $4.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
​
Amazon Transaction Agreement in 2017
​
On April 4, 2017, the Company and Amazon entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “2017 Amazon Transaction Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a warrant (the “2017 Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares (the “2017 Amazon Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events. The Company and Amazon entered into the 2017 Amazon Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements between the Company and Amazon with respect to the deployment of the Company’s GenKey fuel cell technology at Amazon distribution centers. The vesting of the 2017 Amazon Warrant Shares was conditioned upon payments made by Amazon or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to the existing commercial agreements. On December 31, 2020, the Company waived the remaining vesting conditions under the 2017 Amazon Warrant, which resulted in the immediate vesting of all the third tranche of the 2017 Amazon Warrant Shares.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all 55,286,696 of the 2017 Amazon Warrant Shares had vested and the 2017 Amazon Warrant was exercised with respect to 34,917,912 shares of the Company’s common stock. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2017 Amazon Warrant during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
​
Walmart Transaction Agreement
​
On July 20, 2017, the Company and Walmart entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Walmart Transaction Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Walmart a warrant (the “Walmart Warrant”) to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events (the “Walmart Warrant Shares”). The Company and Walmart entered into the Walmart Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements between the Company and Walmart with respect to the deployment of the Company’s GenKey fuel cell technology across various Walmart distribution centers. The existing commercial agreements contemplate, but do not guarantee, future purchase orders for the Company’s fuel cell technology. The vesting of the warrant shares was conditioned upon payments made by Walmart or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to transactions entered into after January 1, 2017 under existing commercial agreements.
​
The majority of the Walmart Warrant Shares will vest based on Walmart’s payment of up to $600.0 million to the Company in connection with Walmart’s purchase of goods and services from the Company. The first tranche of 5,819,652 Walmart Warrant Shares vested upon the execution of the Walmart Warrant and was fully exercised as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, $10.9 million, the fair value of the first tranche of Walmart Warrant Shares, was recorded as a provision for common stock warrants and presented as a reduction to revenue on the consolidated statements of operations during 2017. All future provision for common stock warrants is measured based on the fair value of the awards and recorded as a charge against revenue. The second tranche of 29,098,260 Walmart Warrant Shares vested in four installments of 7,274,565 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, made an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $200.0 million in the aggregate.
​
The exercise price for the first and second tranches of Walmart Warrant Shares was $2.1231 per share. After Walmart has made payments to the Company totaling $200.0 million, the third tranche of 20,368,784 Walmart Warrant

Table of Contents
Shares will vest in eight installments of 2,546,098 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $400.0 million in the aggregate. The exercise price of the third tranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares is $6.28 per share, which was determined pursuant to the terms of the Walmart Warrant as an amount equal to 90% of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the Company’s common stock as of October 30, 2023, the final vesting date of the second tranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares. The Walmart Warrant is exercisable through July 20, 2027. The Walmart Warrant provides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holder, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price. The Walmart Warrant provides for certain adjustments that may be made to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise due to customary anti-dilution provisions based on future events. The Walmart Warrant is classified as an equity instrument. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to the Walmart Warrant was $2.6 million.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 40,010,108 and 34,917,912 of the Walmart Warrant Shares had vested, respectively, and the Walmart Warrant was exercised with respect to 13,094,217 shares of the Company’s common stock. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Walmart Warrant during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $19.6 million, $5.9 million, and $7.1 million, respectively.
​
​
Operating and Finance Lease Liabilities
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had operating leases, as lessee, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions that are partially secured by restricted cash, security deposits and pledged escrows (see also Note 1, “Nature of Operations”) as summarized below. These leases expire over the next one to six years. Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
​
Leases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of cancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the Company may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the lessor to renew the lease at market rental rates. No residual value guarantees are contained in the leases. No financial covenants are contained within the lease, however there are customary operational covenants such as assurance the Company properly maintains the leased assets and carries appropriate insurance, etc. The leases include credit support in the form of either cash, collateral or letters of credit. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for a description of cash held as security associated with the leases.

Extended Maintenance Contracts
​
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure that has been sold. We measure loss accruals at the customer contract level. The expected revenues and expenses for these contracts include all applicable expected costs of providing services over the remaining term of the contracts and the related unearned net revenue. A loss is recognized if the sum of expected costs of providing services under the contract exceeds related unearned net revenue and is recorded as a provision for loss contracts related to service in the consolidated statements of operations. As we continue to work to improve quality and reliability, unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise and additional material charges may be incurred in the future. These quality issues could also adversely affect our contract loss accrual. The Company has undertaken and will undertake several other initiatives to extend the life and improve the reliability of its equipment. As a result of these initiatives and our additional expectation that the increase in certain costs will abate, the Company believes that its contract loss accrual is sufficient. However, if elevated service costs persist, the Company will adjust its estimated future service costs and increase its contract loss accrual estimate.
​

Restructuring
​
In February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance our financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a competitive market, we approved the 2024 Restructuring Plan, a comprehensive initiative that encompassed a broad range of measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions. These measures were aimed at increasing efficiency, improving scalability, and maintaining our leadership position in the renewable energy industry. We began executing the 2024 Restructuring Plan in February 2024 and it was effectively completed during the fourth quarter of 2024.
​
The determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. We account for involuntary termination benefits that are provided pursuant to one-time benefit arrangements in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) whereas involuntary termination benefits that are part of an ongoing written or substantive plan are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits (“ASC 712”). We accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 420 in the period in which the plan is communicated to the employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory requirements, we accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 712 when the existing situation or set of circumstances indicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be paid within the next twelve months.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $8.1 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of $6.9 million and other restructuring costs of $1.2 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Severance expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 in accordance with ASC 420 was a result of the separation of full-time employees associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan. As of December 31, 2024, $0.1 million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, other restructuring costs were represented by (1) $0.2 million of legal and professional services costs, and (2) $1.0 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. As of December 31, 2024, $28 thousand of accrued other restructuring costs were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during 2025.
​
Tax Credits
​
Section 45V Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen
​
Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that it qualifies for the PTC under Section 45V as part of the IRA resulting from operation of the Company’s hydrogen production plant located in Georgia. The PTC 
66

Table of Contents
is available for qualified clean hydrogen produced and sold during the 10-year period beginning on the date the qualified clean hydrogen production facility was originally placed in service. The Company has chosen elective pay, also referred to as direct pay, for the 2024 taxable year. This election makes the PTC refundable, as the Company can receive the full value of the credit from the Internal Revenue Service. This election will apply to the 2024 taxable year and the four subsequent taxable years unless revoked. During the remaining five years of the 10-year period to receive the PTC, the Company can elect to transfer all or a portion of the PTC to a third party buyer in exchange for cash. The Company has analogized the accounting of the PTC to accounting for government grants due to the ability to receive payment for the credit regardless of whether the Company has an income tax liability.
​
As the PTC is a refundable credit (i.e., a credit with a direct-pay option available), the PTC is outside the scope of ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”). Therefore, the Company has analogized the accounting of the PTC to accounting for government grants due to the ability to receive payment for the credit regardless of whether the Company has an income tax liability. Under a government grant model, once it is reasonably assured that the entity will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant money should be recognized on a systematic basis over the period in which the entity recognizes the related expenses or losses for which the grant money is intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once it is probable that both of the following conditions will be met: (1) the Company is eligible to receive the grant and (2) the Company is able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grant.
​
With respect to the PTC, based on our current production, the Company expects to qualify for the full $3 per kg credit. For the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company recognized PTC of $4.0 million as a reduction to the fuel delivered to customers and related equipment costs of revenue financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations and $4.5 million as an increase to the other assets financial statement line item in the consolidated balance sheets.
​
Section 48 Credit for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties of Energy Storage Technologies
​
As of December 31, 2024 the Company determined that it qualifies for the Section 48 ITC for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties of Energy Storage Technologies related to its hydrogen storage and liquefaction assets at its Georgia hydrogen plant. A base rate credit of 6% is available to qualified energy storage property in the year that it is placed in-service, with availability of increased credit rates if the property qualifies. The Company determined that it qualified for a rate credit of 30%. As the ITC is considered a transferable tax credit, the Company is accounting for it as a grant related to assets. Therefore, the ITC is recognized as a reduction to the Georgia hydrogen production plant’s cost-basis, recognized within the “property, plant, and equipment, net” financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets, which will reduce future depreciation over the next 30 years. The amount of the ITC, which is recognized in the prepaid expenses, tax credits, and other current assets financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, was $31.3 million.
​
Critical Accounting Estimates
​
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories and intangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, valuation of equity method investments, accrual for service loss contracts, operating and finance leases, allowance for credit losses, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1) the carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
​
We believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions the Company must make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.
67

Table of Contents
​
Revenue Recognition
​
The Company enters into contracts that may contain one or a combination of fuel cell systems and infrastructure, installation, maintenance, spare parts, fuel delivery and other support services. Contracts containing fuel cell systems and related infrastructure may be sold directly to customers or provided to customers under a PPA. The Company also enters into contracts that contain electrolyzer stacks, systems, maintenance, and other support services. Furthermore, the Company enters into contracts related to the sales of cryogenic equipment, liquefaction systems and engineered equipment.
​
The Company does not include a right of return on its products other than rights related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated standard warranty costs at the same time that revenue is recognized for the related product, or when circumstances indicate that warranty costs will be incurred, as applicable. Any prepaid amounts would only be refunded to the extent services have not been provided or the fuel cell systems or infrastructure have not been delivered
.
​
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price specified in a contract with a customer, subject to the allocation of the transaction price to distinct performance obligations as discussed below. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a product or service to a customer. 
​
Promises to the customer are separated into performance obligations and are accounted for separately if they are (1) capable of being distinct and (2) distinct in the context of the contract. The Company considers a performance obligation to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and the Company’s promise to transfer the goods or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
​
Payment terms for sales of fuel cells, infrastructure, and service to customers are typically 30 to 90 days from shipment of the goods. Payment terms on electrolyzer systems are typically based on achievement of milestones over the term of the contract with the customer. Sale/leaseback transactions with financial institutions are invoiced and collected upon transaction closing. Service is prepaid upfront in a majority of the arrangements. The Company does not adjust the transaction price for a significant financing component when the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled within a year.
​
The Company has issued to each of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC and Walmart warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company presents the provision for common stock warrants within each revenue-related line item on the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation reflects the discount that those common stock warrants represent, and therefore revenue is net of these non-cash charges. The provision of common stock warrants is allocated to the relevant revenue-related line items based upon the expected mix of the revenue for each respective contract. See Note 19, “Warrant Transaction Agreements”, for more details.
​
Nature of goods and services
​
The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue.
​
(a)
Sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other
​
(i)
Sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure and equipment
​
Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure, and equipment represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for fuel cells systems and the related infrastructure. For GenDrive fuel cells, given the nascent nature of the Company’s market, the Company considers several inputs, including prices from a limited number of standalone sales as well as the Company’s negotiations with customers. The Company also considers its costs to produce fuel cells as well as comparable list prices in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company uses applicable observable evidence from similar products in the market to determine standalone selling prices for GenSure stationary backup power units and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The 
68

Table of Contents
determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligations requires significant judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. The allocated transaction price related to fuel cell systems and spare parts is recognized as revenue at a point in time which usually occurs upon delivery (and occasionally at time of shipment). Revenue on hydrogen infrastructure installations is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon customer acceptance of the hydrogen infrastructure. The Company uses an input method to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period when such revenue is recognized over time, based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
​
(ii) Sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions
​
Revenue from sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions represents sales of electrolyzer stacks and systems used to generate hydrogen for various applications including mobility, ammonia production, methanol production, power to gas, and other uses.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for electrolyzer systems solutions. Electrolyzer stacks are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of electrolyzer systems. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligations requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. Revenue on electrolyzer systems and stacks is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon title transfer at shipment or delivery to the customer location. In certain instances, control of electrolyzer systems transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure (cost-to-total cost or percentage-of-completion method) of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
​
Payments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related cost of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred.
​
(iii) Sales of cryogenic equipment and other
​
Revenue from sales of cryogenic equipment represents sales of liquefaction system and other cryogenic equipment such as trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquefied hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for liquefaction systems and cryogenic equipment. Liquefaction systems are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of liquefaction systems when sold with other equipment. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligation requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Revenue on liquefaction systems is generally recognized over time. Control transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.

​
(b) Services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure
​
Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine standalone selling prices for services. This approach considers market conditions and constraints while maximizing the use of available observable inputs obtained from a limited number of historical standalone service renewal prices and negotiations with customers. The transaction price allocated to services as discussed above is generally recognized as revenue over time on a straight-line basis over the expected service period, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of routine, recurring maintenance performed throughout the contract period.
​
In substantially all of its transactions, the Company sells extended maintenance contracts that generally provide for a five-to-ten-year service period from the date of product installation in exchange for an up-front payment. Services include monitoring, technical support, maintenance and related services. These services are accounted for as a separate performance obligation, and accordingly, revenue generated from these transactions, subject to the proportional allocation of transaction price, is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the Company may enter into annual service and extended maintenance contracts that are billed monthly. Revenue generated from these transactions is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs are recognized as incurred over the term of the contract. When costs are projected to exceed revenues over the life of the extended maintenance contract, an accrual for loss contracts is recorded. Costs are estimated based upon historical experience and consider the estimated impact of the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, if any. The actual results may differ from these estimates. See “Extended Maintenance Contracts” above.
​
Extended maintenance contracts generally do not contain customer renewal options. Upon expiration, customers may either negotiate a contract extension or switch to purchasing spare parts and maintaining the fuel cell systems on their own.
​
(c)
Power purchase agreements
​
Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company’s GenKey solution.
​
Revenue associated with these agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreements as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits from the Company’s performance of the services. The customers receive services ratably over the contract term.
​
In conjunction with entering into a PPA with a customer, the Company may enter into a separate transaction with third-party financial institutions in which the Company receives proceeds from the sale/leaseback transactions of the equipment and the sale of future service revenue. The proceeds from the financial institution are allocated between the sale of equipment and the sale of future service revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices of equipment and service. The proceeds allocated to the sale of future services are recognized as finance obligations. The proceeds allocated to the sale of the equipment are evaluated to determine if the transaction meets the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting. To meet the sale/leaseback criteria, control of the equipment must transfer to the financial institution, which requires among other criteria the leaseback to meet the criteria for an operating lease and the Company must not have a right to repurchase the equipment (unless specific criteria are met). These transactions typically meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of the equipment and separately recognizes the leaseback obligations.
​
The Company recognizes an operating lease liability for the equipment leaseback obligation based on the present value of the future payments to the financial institutions that are attributed to the equipment leaseback. The discount rate 
70

Table of Contents
used to determine the lease liability is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company also records a right of use asset which is amortized over the term of the leaseback. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the leaseback and is included as a cost of power purchase agreements revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
​
Certain of the Company’s transactions with financial institutions do not meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, no equipment sale is recognized. All proceeds from these transactions are accounted for as finance obligations. The right of use assets related to these transactions are classified as equipment related to the PPAs and fuel delivered to the customers, net in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses its transaction-date incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate for its finance obligations that arise from these transactions. No additional adjustments to the incremental borrowing rate have been deemed necessary for the finance obligations that have resulted from the failed sale/leaseback transactions.
​
In determining whether the sales of fuel cells and other equipment to financial institutions meet the requirements for revenue recognition under sale/leaseback accounting, the Company, as lessee, determines the classification of the lease. The Company estimates certain key inputs to the associated calculations such as: 1) discount rate used to determine the present value of future lease payments, 2) fair value of the fuel cells and equipment, and 3) useful life of the underlying asset(s):
​
●
ASC 842, 
Leases
 (“ASC 842”), requires a lessee to discount its future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in its leases because it does not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to estimate the discount rate for each lease. Adjustments that considered the Company’s actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. 
​
●
In order for the lease to be classified as an operating lease, the present value of the future lease payments cannot exceed 90% of the fair value of the leased assets. The Company estimates the fair value of the lease assets using the sales prices.
​
●
In order for a lease to be classified as an operating lease, the lease term cannot exceed 75% (major part) of the estimated useful life of the leased asset. The average estimated useful life of the fuel cells is 10 years, and the average estimated useful life of the hydrogen infrastructure is 20 years. These estimated useful lives are compared to the term of each lease to determine the appropriate lease classification.

​
(d)
Fuel delivered to customers and related equipment
​
Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production plants. The stand-alone selling price is not estimated because it is sold separately and therefore directly observable.
​
The Company purchases hydrogen fuel from suppliers in most cases (and sometimes produces hydrogen onsite) and sells to its customers. Revenue and cost of revenue related to this fuel is recorded as dispensed and is included in the respective fuel delivered to customers and related equipment lines on the consolidated statements of operations.
​
(e)
Other revenue
​
Other revenue includes payments received for technical services that include engineering services, program management services, procurement services and operations, testing and validation services with HyVia. The scope of these services includes mutually agreed upon services as were requested from time to time by HyVia. Other revenue also includes sales of electrolyzer engineering and design services. The scope of these services includes establishing and defining project technical requirements, standards and guidelines as well as assistance in scoping and scheduling of large-scale electrolyzer solutions.

Impairment
​
During the fourth quarter of 2024, in connection with the Company’s preparation of its consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized that sales and margin projections were likely not to be met for 2024. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, in connection with the Company’s preparation of its consolidated financial statements, the Company performed strategic planning, analyzing its various product lines, and it was determined at that time to update the future sales projections and related cash flow projections for certain of those product lines. As a result, there was a reduction in the cash flow projections during the fourth quarter of 2024 to several of the Company’s asset groups indicating that the carrying values of their long-lived assets (including property, plant, and equipment, equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers, and right of use assets related to operating leases) and finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable.
​
Asset groups are the unit of account for a long-lived asset or assets to be held and used which represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash flow projections for several asset groups was largely attributed to several factors, including the Company failing to meet 2024 sales and margin projections as well as decreased future cash flow projections across certain product lines including stationary, liquefiers and fuel cells for mobility projects related to HyVia. On December 10, 2024, HyVia announced that it entered into legal recovery proceedings recorded by the Commercial Court of Versailles. Additionally, the Company paused certain hydrogen production plant projects during the fourth quarter of 2024. This pause, as well as the decrease in cash flow projections, was primarily due to weakening demand in the global hydrogen market. As a result, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles by comparing the carrying values against undiscounted future cash flow projections and determined that an impairment existed.
​
During the fourth quarter of 2024, a significant amount of property, plant, and equipment were written down to their estimated fair values. The fair value for revenue generating assets was determined using a market approach utilizing prices for similar assets in active markets. The fair value for property, plant, and equipment was determined using a market approach, where available, and where not available, a cost approach. The fair value for equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers was determined using a discounted cash flow income approach considering estimated market rent. The fair value for right of use assets related to operating leases was determined using a discounted cash flow income approach considering estimated market rent. The fair values for finite-lived intangible assets were determined using the income approach.
​
The Company recognized impairment charges of $949.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $269.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in impairment was primarily due to impairment charges of $902.2 million resulting from the ASC 360 impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2024. Of the $902.2 million, $675.5 million was related to property, plant and equipment, $1.6 million was related to equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers, $145.4 million was related to right of use assets related to operating leases, and $79.7 million was related to finite-lived intangible assets. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $38.3 million impairment charge related to contract assets and other current assets in which the Company determined it would be unable to collect the consideration from a customer contract, impairment charges of $0.3 million related to property, plant and equipment as well as other impairment charges of $0.1 million. Other impairment charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $8.4 million, of which $3.0 million related to non-marketable equity securities and $5.4 million related to property, plant and equipment.
​
The impairment charge of $269.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the impairment of goodwill of $249.5 million as well as $2.4 million related to contract assets, $9.7 million related to other current assets, $3.1 million related to property, plant and equipment, $4.6 million was related to right of use assets related to operating leases and $0.2 million related to equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers.
​
To the extent there are further changes in market conditions or the performance of the Company’s long-lived assets, there is a possibility that the Company could incur additional impairment charges in the future.

Inventory Valuation
​
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and net realizable value. All inventory, including spare parts inventory held at service locations, is not relieved until the customer has received the

Table of Contents
product, at which time the customer obtains control of the goods. We maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs within the next twelve months based upon present levels of production. An allowance for potential non-saleable inventory due to damaged, excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory, past history, and expected usage. The Company's estimate of the reserves utilizes certain inputs and involves judgment. The Company evaluates excess and obsolescence and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and, as necessary, reserves inventory based upon a variety of factors, including historical usage, forecasted usage and sales, product obsolescence, anticipated selling price, and anticipated cost to complete to determine product margin and other factors. We review all contracts related to product lines with projected negative margins that are arranged to be sold at a loss in the future as the basis for a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment.
​
Common Stock Warrant Accounting
​
The Company accounts for common stock warrants as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the respective warrant agreements. Common stock warrants that meet certain applicable requirements of ASC Subtopic 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
, and other related guidance, including the ability of the Company to settle the warrants without the issuance of registered shares or the absence of rights of the grantee to require cash settlement, are accounted for as equity instruments. The Company classifies these equity instruments within additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
Common stock warrants accounted for as equity instruments represent the warrants issued to Amazon and Walmart as discussed in Note 19, “Warrant Transaction Agreements”. The Company adopted FASB ASU 2019-08, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation
 (Topic 718) and 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606), which requires entities to measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer.
​
In order to calculate warrant charges, the Company used the Black-Scholes pricing model, which required key inputs including volatility and risk-free interest rate and certain unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of unvested warrants, considered to be probable of vesting, at the time. Based on that estimated fair value, the Company determined warrant charges, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

​
Climate Disclosures
​
In March 2024, the SEC issued Release No. 33-11275, 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors
, which includes final rules that enhance the transparency of climate-related disclosures and require companies to disclose material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks; information about the board of directors' oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition. Companies are also required to disclose the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the notes to the financial statements, and certain large companies are also required to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, when material. As a large accelerated filer, most disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025. The SEC has been the subject of various lawsuits since adopting these rules. As a result of ongoing litigation, the SEC issued an order in April 2024 to stay the effectiveness of the rules while judicial review is pending. We are continuing to monitor developments associated with these rules and are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
​
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
​
Credit Risk
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were maintained with financial institutions in which our current deposits are in excess of insured limits. We believe these institutions have sufficient assets and liquidity to conduct its operations in the ordinary course of business with little or no credit risk to us.
​
Interest Rate Risk
​
The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is primarily limited to our cash equivalents. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments, positions or transactions in any material fashion, except for the 3.75% Notes Capped Call purchased in May 2020 related to the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. Additionally, the Company purchased a common stock forward in March 2018, which was extended upon issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes.
​
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
​
Portions of our revenue and operating expenses that are incurred outside the United States are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro. Our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates is primarily related to operations of Plug Power Europe, our French subsidiary, as well as Frames, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in the Netherlands. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We also have two joint ventures (1) an investment in AccionaPlug S.L., a joint venture with Acciona, and (2) an investment in SK Plug Hyverse, a joint venture with SK Innovation, as well as an investment in the Clean H2 Infra Fund. Our exposure to foreign currency can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from our equity method investments in Acciona and Clean H2 Infra Fund, which all operate in Europe, and SK Plug Hyverse, which operates in Asia. Our AccionaPlug S.L., SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2 Infra Fund exposure presently is immaterial as commercial activities are in early stages.
​
Inflation Risk
​
Inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses, may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to increase our gross margin or reduce our selling and marketing and operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase as much as or more than our operating expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Plug Power Inc. 
​
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Plug Power and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
​
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Plug Power Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Plug Power Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Inventories - Reserves -- Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company establishes inventory reserves against excess, obsolete and damaged goods, and records its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  As part of these processes, the Company reviews all contracts related to product lines with projected negative margins that are expected to be sold at a loss in the future, which serves as the basis for the Company’s lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment.  The Company's estimate of the reserves utilizes certain inputs and involves judgment. The Company evaluates these reserves on a quarterly basis and, as necessary, writes down the valuation of inventory based upon historical usage, forecasted usage and sales, product obsolescence, anticipated selling price, anticipated cost to complete to determine product margin, and other factors. Reserves are included in inventory, net, on the balance sheet. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value as of December 31, 2024, was $158.9 million.
​
We identified the inventory reserves as a critical audit matter because of judgments made by management in determining the reserves. This required a high degree of auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's reserves.
​
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
​
Our audit procedures related to inventory reserves included the following, among others:
​
●
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls associated with management's process for recording inventory reserves.
●
We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's inventory reserve policies, considering historical experience and the underlying assumptions.
●
We tested the calculation of the excess and obsolescence reserve pursuant to the Company's policy, on a sample basis, including the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation.

●
We tested the calculation of the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve pursuant to the Company's policy, on a sample basis, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation.
●
We performed procedures to evaluate management's forecast by tracing demand for our selection to a finished good part and sales orders for that part.
●
We made inquiries of senior financial and operating management to determine whether any strategic, regulatory, or operational changes in the business were consistent with the projections of future demand and future costs that were utilized as the basis for the reserve recorded.
●
We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on consideration of internal communications to management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analysts' reports, as well as any changes within the business. 
​
Impairment — Refer to Notes 2 and 8 of the financial statements
​
Critical Audit Matter Description
​
Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, right of use assets, leasehold improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization and  length of time the asset will be used in the Company’s operations, and (iii) estimated residual values. Fair value is determined using various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Impairment charges resulting from the Company’s impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2024 were $902.2 million.
​
We identified the determination of fair value related to the measurement of impairment of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to determine the fair values of the impaired assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists when performing audit procedures over the impairment of the long-lived assets.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to managements judgements underlying the impairment charge included the following, among others:
​
●
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls associated with management's process for recording the impairment charge.
●
With the assistance of our fair value valuation specialists:
o
Evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies for the asset groups;
o
Evaluated the reasonableness of the key inputs and assumptions utilized in the personal property fair value analysis;
o
Evaluated the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions utilized in the intangible assets fair value analysis including: discount rate, royalty rate, and technology obsolescence factors;
o
Evaluated the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions utilized in the right of use asset fair value analysis including: market rent, market rent growth, and discount rate
●
Tested the underlying data which served as the basis for the determination of fair value to test that the inputs were accurate and complete.
●
Evaluated the Company's disclosures related to impairment to assess their conformity with the applicable accounting standards.

1. Nature of Operations
​
Description of Business
​
Plug is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly electrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions.
​
While we continue to develop commercially viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions, we have 
expanded our offerings to support a variety of commercial operations that can be powered with clean hydrogen. We provide electrolyzers that allow customers — such as refineries, producers of chemicals, steel, fertilizer and commercial refueling stations — to generate hydrogen on-site
. 
We are focusing our efforts on (a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) production of hydrogen; and (c) stationary power systems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and generation facilities, in either a backup power or continuous power role, and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for telecommunication logistics, transportation, and utility customers. Plug expects to support these products and customers with an ecosystem of vertically integrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for mobility and power applications.
​
Our current product and service portfolio includes: 
​
GenDrive
: GenDrive is our hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell system, providing power to material handling EVs, including Class 1, 2, 3 and 6 electric forklifts, automated guided vehicles, and ground support equipment.
​
GenSure
: GenSure is our stationary fuel cell solution providing scalable, modular PEM fuel cell power to support the backup and grid-support power requirements of the telecommunications, transportation, and utility sectors; our GenSure High Power Fuel Cell Platform supports large scale stationary power and data center markets.
​
Progen
: Progen is our fuel cell stack and engine technology currently used globally in mobility and stationary fuel cell systems. This includes Plug’s membrane electrode assembly (“MEA”), a critical component of the fuel cell stack used in zero-emission fuel cell systems.
​
GenFuel
: GenFuel is our liquid hydrogen fueling, delivery, generation, storage, and dispensing system.
​
GenCare
: GenCare is our ongoing “Internet of Things”-based maintenance and on-site service program for GenDrive fuel cell systems, GenSure fuel cell systems, GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products and Progen fuel cell engines. 
​
GenKey
: GenKey is our vertically integrated “turn-key” solution combining either GenDrive or GenSure fuel cell power with GenFuel fuel and GenCare aftermarket service, offering complete simplicity to customers transitioning to fuel cell power.
​
Electrolyzers
: The design and implementation of 5MW and 10MW electrolyzer systems that are modular, scalable hydrogen generators optimized for clean hydrogen production. Electrolyzers generate hydrogen from water using electricity and a special membrane and “green” hydrogen is generated by using renewable energy inputs, such as solar or wind power.
​
Liquefaction Systems
: Plug’s 15 ton-per-day and 30 ton-per-day liquefiers are engineered for high efficiency, reliability, and operational flexibility — providing consistent liquid hydrogen to customers. This design increases plant reliability and availability while minimizing parasitic losses like heat leak and seal gas losses. 
​
Cryogenic Equipment:
 E
ngineered equipment including trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquified hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.

​
Liquid Hydrogen:
 Liquid hydrogen provides an efficient fuel alternative to fossil-based energy. We produce liquid hydrogen through our electrolyzer systems and liquefaction systems. Liquid hydrogen supply will be used by customers in material handling operations, fuel cell electric vehicle fleets, and stationary power applications.
​
We provide our products and solutions worldwide through our direct sales force, and by leveraging relationships with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealer networks. Plug is currently targeting Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East and North America for expansion in adoption. The European Union (the “EU”) has rolled out ambitious targets for the hydrogen economy, with the United Kingdom also taking steps in this direction, and Plug is seeking to execute on our strategy to become one of the European leaders in the hydrogen economy. This includes a targeted account strategy for material handling, securing strategic partnerships with European OEMs, energy companies, utility leaders and accelerating our electrolyzer business.
In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power LA JV, LLC, created a joint venture with Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Olin, named “Hidrogenii” in the third quarter of 2022. The Company has determined Hidrogenii to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and the Company is considered to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary. We believe Hidrogenii will support reliability of supply and speed to market for hydrogen throughout North America and set the foundation for broader collaboration between Plug and Olin. The construction of the 15-ton-per-day hydrogen production plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana progressed as planned in 2024 and is on schedule, as previously announced, for operations in the first quarter of 2025 once the final commissions phase is complete. Hidrogenii is owned 
50
% by Plug Power LA JV, LLC and 
50
% by Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC.
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, entered into a joint venture with Renault named HyVia in the second quarter of 2021. HyVia was formed to manufacture and sell fuel cell powered electric light commercial vehicles (“FCE-LCVs”) and to supply hydrogen fuel and fueling stations to support the FCE-LCV market, in each case primarily in Europe. HyVia is owned 
50
% by Plug Power France and 
50
% by Renault. In December 2024, HyVia entered receivership proceedings after facing challenges in the slow evolution of hydrogen mobility ecosystems in Europe. During 2024, the Company recorded losses for HyVia which resulted in the investments in non-consolidated entities and non-marketable equity securities financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets related to HyVia to be $
0
 as of December 31, 2024. For additional information see Note 4, “Investments”.
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power España S.L. (“Plug Power Spain”), entered into a joint venture with Acciona, named AccionaPlug S.L., in the fourth quarter of 2021. The joint venture intends to develop clean hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal. AccionaPlug S.L. has received funding and is owned 
50
% by Plug Power Spain and 
50
% by Acciona.
​
Plug Power Inc. entered into a joint venture with SK Innovation named SK Plug Hyverse, which was initially funded in the first quarter of 2022. SK Plug Hyverse seeks to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in selected Asian markets. This collaboration aims to provide hydrogen fuel cell systems, hydrogen fueling stations, electrolyzers and clean hydrogen to the Korean and other selected Asian markets. The partnership will leverage SK Innovation’s leadership in chemicals, petroleum and energy as well as Plug’s leading hydrogen platform. This joint venture is owned 
49
% by Plug Power Inc. and 
51
% by SK Innovation.
​
Plug Power Inc. has also invested in a hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity fund, Clean H2 Infra Fund, a special limited partnership registered in France, since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Clean H2 Infra Fund is focused on clean hydrogen infrastructure through financing projects in the production, storage and distribution of clean hydrogen. As of December 31, 2024 the Company’s ownership percentage in the Clean H2 Infra Fund was approximately 
5
%.
​
Liquidity and Capital Resources
​
The Company has continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses of approximately $
2.1
 billion, $
1.4
 billion and $
724.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s working capital was $
729.0
 million at December 31, 2024, which included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $
205.7
 million and current restricted cash of $
198.0
 million.
​
F-10

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
The future use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of our businesses, the optimal allocation of our resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of capital, market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time and at terms favorable to the Company.
​
The Company has an “at-the-market” equity offering program with B. Riley pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell through or to B. Riley, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $
1.0
 billion. The Company has the right at its sole discretion to direct B. Riley to act on a principal basis and purchase directly from the Company up to $
11.0
 million of shares of its common stock on any trading day if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $
1.0
 billion (or up to $
10.0
 million if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $
1.0
 billion) and up to $
55.0
 million of shares in any calendar week if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $
1.0
 billion (or up to $
30.0
 million if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $
1.0
 billion). On February 23, 2024 and November 7, 2024, the Company and B. Riley amended the at-the-market equity program to increase the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock available for issuance under the program to $
1.0
 billion. The amended program will terminate upon the earliest of (a) December 31, 2025 with respect to principal transactions and January 17, 2026 with respect to agency transactions, (b) the sale of all shares of common stock under the program or (c) termination of the sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 
219,835,221
 shares of its common stock at a weighted-average sales price of $
3.08
 per share for net proceeds of $
666.9
 million under the ATM agreement. 
​
On July 22, 2024, the Company sold 
78,740,157
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
2.54
 per share for net proceeds of $
191.0
 million after deducting the underwriting discount and related offering expenses.
​
On November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Debenture Purchase Agreement (the “Debenture Purchase Agreement”) with YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (“Yorkville”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Yorkville an unsecured convertible debenture in aggregate principal amount of $
200.0
 million in exchange for the payment of $
190.0
 million. For more information, see Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”.
​
In addition, on February 10, 2025, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with Yorkville (the “SEPA”), pursuant to which the Company has the right, at its option, to sell to Yorkville up to $
1.0
 billion in the aggregate gross sales of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth therein. The Company has the right, but not the obligation, from time to time at its sole discretion to direct Yorkville to purchase directly from the Company up to $
10.0
 million shares of its common stock on any trading day.
​
On March 3, 2025, the Company announced their 2025 restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”). The 2025 Restructuring Plan includes initiatives to reduce our workforce, realign the Company’s manufacturing footprint and streamline the organization to enhance operational efficiency and improve overall liquidity. The expected annual savings from the 2025 Restructuring Plan are expected to be significant and will begin to be realized beginning in the second half of 2025.
​
The Company believes that its working capital, cash position and restricted cash to be released over the next 12 months, together with its right to direct B. Riley to purchase shares from the Company under the “at-the-market” equity offering program and its right to direct Yorkville to purchase shares from the Company under the SEPA, will be sufficient to fund its on-going operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
​
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
​
Principles of Consolidation
​
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, we include our share of the results of our joint ventures HyVia, AccionaPlug S.L. and SK Plug Hyverse, and our investment in Clean H2 Infra Fund using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest and our ability to exercise significant 
F-11

Table of Contents

​
influence over the operating and financial decisions of HyVia, AccionaPlug S.L., SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2 Infra Fund.
​
We consolidate all entities we control under either the voting interest model, which generally applies when we hold a majority of the voting interest of an entity, or the variable interest model, which applies to arrangements for which we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders’ interests are reflected as non-controlling interest on our consolidated financial statements. We are considered the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of Hidrogenii and consolidate the joint venture within our single reportable segment. For additional information, refer to Note 28, “Variable Interest Entities”.
​
Use of Estimates
​
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories and intangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, valuation of equity method investments, accrual for service loss contracts, operating and finance leases, allowance for credit losses, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1) the carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
​
Revenue Recognition
​
The Company enters into contracts that may contain one or a combination of fuel cell systems and infrastructure, installation, maintenance, spare parts, fuel delivery and other support services. Contracts containing fuel cell systems and related infrastructure may be sold directly to customers or provided to customers under a Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”). The Company also enters into contracts that contain electrolyzer stacks, systems, maintenance, and other support services. Furthermore, the Company enters into contracts related to the sales of cryogenic equipment, liquefaction systems and engineered equipment.
​
The Company does not include a right of return on its products other than rights related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated standard warranty costs at the same time that revenue is recognized for the related product, or when circumstances indicate that warranty costs will be incurred, as applicable. Any prepaid amounts would only be refunded to the extent services have not been provided or the fuel cell systems or infrastructure have not been delivered
.
​
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price specified in a contract with a customer, subject to the allocation of the transaction price to distinct performance obligations as discussed below. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a product or service to a customer. 
​
Promises to the customer are separated into performance obligations and are accounted for separately if they are (1) capable of being distinct and (2) distinct in the context of the contract. The Company considers a performance obligation to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and the Company’s promise to transfer the goods or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
​
Payment terms for sales of fuel cells, infrastructure, and service to customers are typically 
30
 to 
90
 days from shipment of the goods. Payment terms on electrolyzer systems are typically based on achievement of milestones over the 
F-12

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
term of the contract with the customer. Sale/leaseback transactions with financial institutions are invoiced and collected upon transaction closing. Service is prepaid upfront in a majority of the arrangements. The Company does not adjust the transaction price for a significant financing component when the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled within a year.
​
The Company has issued to each of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC and Walmart warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company presents the provision for common stock warrants within each revenue-related line item on the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation reflects the discount that those common stock warrants represent, and therefore revenue is net of these non-cash charges. The provision of common stock warrants is allocated to the relevant revenue-related line items based upon the expected mix of the revenue for each respective contract. See Note 19, “Warrant Transaction Agreements”, for more details.
​
Nature of goods and services
​
The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue.
​
(a)
Sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other
​
(i)
Sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure and equipment
​
Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure, and equipment represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for fuel cells systems and the related infrastructure. For GenDrive fuel cells, given the nascent nature of the Company’s market, the Company considers several inputs, including prices from a limited number of standalone sales as well as the Company’s negotiations with customers. The Company also considers its costs to produce fuel cells as well as comparable list prices in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company uses applicable observable evidence from similar products in the market to determine standalone selling prices for GenSure stationary backup power units and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligations requires significant judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. The allocated transaction price related to fuel cell systems and spare parts is recognized as revenue at a point in time which usually occurs upon delivery (and occasionally at time of shipment). Revenue on hydrogen infrastructure installations is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon customer acceptance of the hydrogen infrastructure. The Company uses an input method to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period when such revenue is recognized over time, based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
​
(ii)
Sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions
​
Revenue from sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions represents sales of electrolyzer stacks and systems used to generate hydrogen for various applications including mobility, ammonia production, methanol production, power to gas, and other uses.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for electrolyzer systems solutions. Electrolyzer stacks are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of electrolyzer systems. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligations requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. Revenue on electrolyzer systems and stacks is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon title transfer at shipment or delivery to the 
F-13

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
customer location. In certain instances, control of electrolyzer systems transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure (cost-to-total cost or percentage-of-completion method) of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
​
Payments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related cost of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred.
​
(iii)
Sales of cryogenic equipment and other
​
Revenue from sales of cryogenic equipment represents sales of liquefaction system and other cryogenic equipment such as trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquefied hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.
​
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for liquefaction systems and cryogenic equipment. Liquefaction systems are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of liquefaction systems when sold with other equipment. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligation requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Revenue on liquefaction systems is generally recognized over time. Control transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. 
​
Revenue on cryogenic equipment is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon title transfer at shipment or delivery to the customer location.
​
Payments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related costs of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred.
​
(b) Services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure
​
Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine standalone selling prices for services. This approach considers market conditions and constraints while maximizing the use of available observable inputs obtained from a limited number of historical standalone service renewal prices and negotiations with customers. The transaction price allocated to services as discussed above is generally recognized as revenue over time on a straight-line basis over the expected service period, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of routine, recurring maintenance performed throughout the contract period.
​
In substantially all of its transactions, the Company sells extended maintenance contracts that generally provide for a 
five
-to-
ten-year
 service period from the date of product installation in exchange for an up-front payment. Services include monitoring, technical support, maintenance and related services. These services are accounted for as a separate performance obligation, and accordingly, revenue generated from these transactions, subject to the proportional allocation of transaction price, is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the Company may enter into annual service and extended maintenance contracts that are billed monthly. 
F-14

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
Revenue generated from these transactions is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs are recognized as incurred over the term of the contract. When costs are projected to exceed revenues over the life of the extended maintenance contract, an accrual for loss contracts is recorded. Costs are estimated based upon historical experience and consider the estimated impact of the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, if any. The actual results may differ from these estimates. See “Extended Maintenance Contracts” below.
​
Extended maintenance contracts generally do not contain customer renewal options. Upon expiration, customers may either negotiate a contract extension or switch to purchasing spare parts and maintaining the fuel cell systems on their own.
​
(c)
Power purchase agreements
​
Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company’s GenKey solution.
​
Revenue associated with these agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreements as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits from the Company’s performance of the services. The customers receive services ratably over the contract term.
​
In conjunction with entering into a PPA with a customer, the Company may enter into a separate transaction with third-party financial institutions in which the Company receives proceeds from the sale/leaseback transactions of the equipment and the sale of future service revenue. The proceeds from the financial institution are allocated between the sale of equipment and the sale of future service revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices of equipment and service. The proceeds allocated to the sale of future services are recognized as finance obligations. The proceeds allocated to the sale of the equipment are evaluated to determine if the transaction meets the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting. To meet the sale/leaseback criteria, control of the equipment must transfer to the financial institution, which requires among other criteria the leaseback to meet the criteria for an operating lease and the Company must not have a right to repurchase the equipment (unless specific criteria are met). These transactions typically meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of the equipment and separately recognizes the leaseback obligations. There were no such transactions during the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
The Company recognizes an operating lease liability for the equipment leaseback obligation based on the present value of the future payments to the financial institutions that are attributed to the equipment leaseback. The discount rate used to determine the lease liability is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company also records a right of use asset which is amortized over the term of the leaseback. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the leaseback and is included as a cost of power purchase agreements revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
​
Certain of the Company’s transactions with financial institutions do not meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, no equipment sale is recognized. All proceeds from these transactions are accounted for as finance obligations. The right of use assets related to these transactions are classified as equipment related to the PPAs and fuel delivered to the customers, net in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses its transaction-date incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate for its finance obligations that arise from these transactions. No additional adjustments to the incremental borrowing rate have been deemed necessary for the finance obligations that have resulted from the failed sale/leaseback transactions.
​
In determining whether the sales of fuel cells and other equipment to financial institutions meet the requirements for revenue recognition under sale/leaseback accounting, the Company, as lessee, determines the classification of the lease. The Company estimates certain key inputs to the associated calculations such as: 1) discount rate used to determine the present value of future lease payments, 2) fair value of the fuel cells and equipment, and 3) useful life of the underlying asset(s):

Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, 
Leases 
(“ASC 842”)
 requires a lessee to discount its future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in its leases

​
because it does not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to estimate the discount rate for each lease. Adjustments that considered the Company’s actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. 
​
●
In order for the lease to be classified as an operating lease, the present value of the future lease payments cannot exceed 90% of the fair value of the leased assets. The Company estimates the fair value of the lease assets using the sales prices.
​
●
In order for a lease to be classified as an operating lease, the lease term cannot exceed 
75
%
 (major part) of the estimated useful life of the leased asset. The average estimated useful life of the fuel cells is 
10 years
, and the average estimated useful life of the hydrogen infrastructure is 
20 years
. These estimated useful lives are compared to the term of each lease to determine the appropriate lease classification.

​
(d)
Fuel delivered to customers and related equipment
​
Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production plants. Depending on the terms of the contract, revenue is recognized either upon delivery or upon consumption. The stand-alone selling price is not estimated because it is sold separately and therefore directly observable.
​
The Company produces hydrogen fuel onsite or purchases hydrogen fuel from suppliers and sells it to its customers. Revenue and cost of revenue related to this fuel is included in the respective fuel delivered to customers and related equipment lines on the consolidated statements of operations.
​
(e)
Other revenue
​
Other revenue includes payments received for technical services that include engineering services, program management services, procurement services and operations, testing and validation services with HyVia. The scope of these services includes mutually agreed upon services as were requested from time to time by HyVia. Other revenue also includes sales of electrolyzer engineering and design services. The scope of these services includes establishing and defining project technical requirements, standards and guidelines as well as assistance in scoping and scheduling of large-scale electrolyzer solutions.
​
Income Taxes
​
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 
​
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC No. 740-10-25, 
Income Taxes-Overall-Recognition
. The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the interest expense line and other expense, net line, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
​
Foreign Currency Translation
​
Foreign currency translation adjustments arising from conversion of the Company’s foreign subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated 
F-16

​
balance sheets. Transaction gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company’s operations give rise to realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses and are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
​
Research and Development
​
Activities that qualify as research and development under ASC 730, 
Research and Development
 (“ASC 730”) include: (i) laboratory research aimed at discovery of new knowledge; (ii) searching for applications of new research findings or other knowledge; (iii) conceptual formulation and design of possible product or process alternatives; (iv) testing in search for or evaluation of product or process alternatives; (v) modification of the formulation or design of a product or process: (vi) design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models; (vii) design of tools, jigs, molds, and dies involving new technology; (viii) design, construction, and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible to the entity for commercial production; (ix) engineering activity required to advance the design of a product to the point that it meets specific functional and economic requirements and is ready for manufacture; and (x) design and development of tools used to facilitate research and development or components of a product or process that are undergoing research and development activities. Costs related to research and development activities by the Company are expensed as incurred.
​
Stock-based Compensation
​
The Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 21, “Employee Benefit Plans”. Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and directors. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at grant-date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes the cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the option’s requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
​
The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue associated with sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure and equipment, cost of revenue for services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations based on the employees’ respective function.
​
The Company has also issued market condition stock options awards that include a market condition. The grant date fair value of market condition stock options awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the cost is recognized using the accelerated attribution method.
​
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, based upon the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company’s statutory tax rate. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the Company’s income tax return are recorded in the income statement.
​
Tax Credits
​
Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that it qualifies for the clean hydrogen production tax credit (“PTC”) under Section 45V as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) resulting from operation of the Company’s hydrogen production plant located in Georgia. The PTC is available for qualified clean hydrogen produced and sold during the 
10-year
 period beginning on the date the qualified clean hydrogen production facility was originally placed in service. The Company has chosen elective pay, also referred to as direct pay, for the 2024 taxable year. This election makes the PTC refundable, as the Company can receive the full value of the credit from the Internal Revenue Service. This election will apply to the 2024 taxable year and the 
four
 subsequent taxable years unless revoked. During the remaining 
five years
 of the 
10-year
 period to receive the PTC, the Company can elect to transfer all or a portion of the PTC to a third party buyer in exchange for cash. The Company has analogized the accounting of the PTC to accounting for government grants due to the ability to receive payment for the credit regardless of whether the Company has an income tax liability. For more information, see Note 27, “Government Assistance”.
​

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
As of December 31, 2024 the Company determined that it qualifies for the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties of Energy Storage Technologies related to its hydrogen storage and liquefaction assets at its Georgia hydrogen plant. A base rate credit of 6% is available to qualified energy storage property in the year that it is placed in-service, with availability of increased credit rates if the property qualifies. The Company determined that it qualified for a rate credit of 30%. As the ITC is considered a transferable tax credit, the Company is accounting for it as a grant related to assets. Therefore, the ITC is recognized as a reduction to the Georgia hydrogen production plant’s cost-basis, recognized within the “property, plant, and equipment, net” financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets, which will reduce future depreciation over the next 
30 years
. For more information, see Note 27, “Government Assistance”.
​
Cash and Cash Equivalents
​
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the fair value of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions located in the U.S. and may at times exceed insured limits.
​
Restricted Cash 
​
Restricted cash consists primarily of cash that serves as support for leasing arrangements. Any cash that is legally restricted from use is classified as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to acquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the restricted cash is included in other long-term assets. Otherwise, restricted cash is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
​
Available-for-sale Securities
​
Available-for-sale securities is comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, with original maturities greater than three months.
 Any credit related losses are recognized as a credit loss allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the statement of operations. Realized gains and losses are due to the sale and maturity of securities classified as available-for-sale and includes the loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss reclassifications for previously unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 investments classified as available-for-sale.
​
Accounts Receivable
​
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed or billable to customers and are ordinarily due between 
30
 and 
120 days
 after the issuance of the invoice. Receivables are reserved or written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer. The allowance for expected credit losses for current accounts receivable is based primarily on past collections experience relative to the length of time receivables are past due; however, when available evidence reasonably supports an assumption that counterparty credit risk over the expected payment period will differ from current and historical payment collections, a forecasting adjustment will be reflected in the allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses and related receivable are reduced when the amount is deemed uncollectible.
​
Inventory
​
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and net realizable value. All inventory, including spare parts inventory held at service locations, is not relieved until the customer has received the product, at which time the customer obtains control of the goods. We maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs within the next twelve months based upon present levels of production. An allowance for potential non-saleable inventory due to damaged, excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory, past history, and expected usage. The Company's estimate of the reserves utilizes certain inputs and involves judgment. The Company 
F-18

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
evaluates excess and obsolescence and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and, as necessary, reserves inventory based upon a variety of factors, including historical usage, forecasted usage and sales, product obsolescence, anticipated selling price, and anticipated cost to complete to determine product margin and other factors. We review all contracts related to product lines with projected negative margins that are arranged to be sold at a loss in the future as the basis for a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment.
​
Property, Plant and Equipment
​
Property, plant and equipment are originally recorded at cost or, if acquired as part of a business combination, at fair value. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as costs are incurred. Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains and losses resulting from the sale of property and equipment are recorded in current operations. Included within machinery and equipment is certain equipment related to our hydrogen plants. The Company records depreciation and amortization over the following estimated useful lives:
​
Building and leasehold improvements

10
 – 
30 years
Machinery and equipment
​
2
 – 
30 years
Software
​
1
 – 
5 years
Hydrogen production plants
​
30 years
​
Equipment Related to PPAs and Fuel Delivered to Customers
​
Equipment related to PPAs and fuel delivered to customers primarily consists of the assets deployed related to PPAs and sites where we deliver fuel to customers as well as equipment related to failed sale/leaseback transactions. Equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis and is included in cost of revenue for PPAs or cost of fuel delivered to customers, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.
​
Investments in Non-consolidated Entities and Non-marketable Equity Securities
​
The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities, such as HyVia, AccionaPlug S.L., SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2 Infra Fund, as equity method investments. 
​
Included in “Investments in non-consolidated entities and non-marketable equity securities” on the consolidated balance sheets are equity investments without readily determinable fair values (“non-marketable equity securities”). Non-marketable equity securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting are measured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer.
​
The Company sells goods and services to related parties, including its equity method investees. Transactions involving services do not result in assets remaining on the books of the investee, and therefore no profit elimination is recorded in accordance with ASC Subtopic 323-10-35, 
Equity Method and Joint Ventures – Subsequent Measurement
. Transactions involving inventory are evaluated if the assets remain on the books of the investee or if they have been sold to a third party – intra-entity profits are eliminated for transactions in which assets remain on the books of the investee.
​
Leases
​
The Company is a lessee in noncancelable (1) operating leases, primarily related to sale/leaseback transactions with financial institutions for deployment of the Company’s products at certain customer sites, and (2) finance leases. The Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842, as amended.
​
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. For finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured in the same manner and date as for operating leases and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
​
F-19

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (2) the lease term, and (3) the lease payments.
​
●
ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in its lease because it does not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to estimate the discount rate for each lease. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. 
Adjustments that considered the Company’s actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality, were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate.
​
●
The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor.
​
●
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments, and for certain finance leases, the exercise price of a Company option to purchase the underlying asset if the Company is reasonably certain at lease commencement to exercise the option.
​
The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right of use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
​
For finance leases, the right of use asset is subsequently amortized using the straight-line method from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the underlying asset or the end of the lease term unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company or the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset. In those cases, the right of use asset is amortized over the useful life of the underlying asset. Amortization of the right of use asset is recognized and presented separately from interest expense on the lease liability.
​
Right of use assets for operating and finance leases are periodically reviewed for impairment losses. The Company uses the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10, 
Property, Plant and Equipment — Overall
, to determine whether a right of use asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize. 
​
The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that require a reassessment of its leases. When a reassessment results in the remeasurement of a lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the corresponding right of use asset.
​
Operating and finance lease right of use assets are presented separately on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The current portions of operating and finance lease liabilities are also presented separately within current liabilities and the long-term portions are presented separately within noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
The Company has elected not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with its short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

​
Intangible Assets
​
Intangible assets consist of acquired technology, customer relationships, trade name and other finite intangibles and are amortized using a straight-line method over their useful lives. Additionally, the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when certain triggering events occur.
​
Goodwill
​
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 goodwill.
​
Impairment
​
Impairment: Goodwill
​
The Company fully impaired its goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s stock price declined below book value during the fourth quarter of 2023. Management believes the decline of the stock price was due primarily to missed projections and reduced liquidity.
​
Impairment: Property, Equipment, Leasehold Improvements, and Finite-lived Intangible Assets
​
Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, leasehold improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service, the asset will be used in the Company’s operations, and (iii) estimated residual values. Fair value is determined using various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.
​
Impairment: PPA Executory Contract Considerations
​
We evaluate PPA assets on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) that indicate the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable. PPA assets that we evaluate include right of use lease assets, equipment deployed to our PPAs, and assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business.
​
Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, PPA assets are evaluated on a per-site basis to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups. For operating assets, the Company has generally determined that the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is based on the customer sites. The assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business are considered to be their own asset group. The cash flows are estimated based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group.
​
For assets related to our PPA agreements, we consider all underlying cash inflows related to our contract revenues and cash outflows relating to the costs incurred to service the PPAs. Our cash flow estimates used in the recoverability test, are based upon, among other things, historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future cash flows and operating performance. Development of future cash flows also requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including timing of future expected cash flows, future cost savings initiatives, and determining recovery values. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect the outcome of our recoverability tests and cause more asset groups to be tested for impairment.
F-21

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
​
If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group are less than the carrying amount of the related asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset group. The impairment loss is then allocated to the assets in the asset group based on the asset’s relative carrying amounts. However, assets are not impaired below their then estimated fair values. Fair value is generally determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as well as year-over-year trends in pricing of our new equipment and overall evaluation of our industry and market, as considered necessary. The Company considers these indicators with certain of its own internal indices and metrics in determining fair value in light of the nascent state of the Company’s market and industry. The estimate of fair value represents our best estimates of these factors and is subject to variability. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect our impairment evaluation.
​
Impairment: ROU Assets
​
The Company evaluates ROU assets in accordance with ASC 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment 
(“ASC 360”). The primary assets underlying the ROU balances are GenDrive units and hydrogen infrastructure utilized in PPA executory contracts with customers. ROU assets are evaluated on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) that indicate the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the ROU assets are evaluated to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups. The Company has generally determined that the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is based on the customer sites. The ROU carrying value is allocated to the various assets under the related lease agreement based on the initial revenue recognized at the execution of the sale lease back agreement. The cash inflows are the contract revenues from the PPA customer and the cash outflows are derived from costs incurred to service the assets under the PPA agreements. Cash flow estimates used in the recoverability test are based upon, among other things, historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future cash flows and operating performance. The development of future cash flows also requires the Company to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including the timing of future expected cash flows, future cost savings initiatives, and determining recovery values. Changes to key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect the outcome of our recoverability tests and cause more asset groups to be tested for impairment.
​
If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group are less than the carrying amount of the related asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the ROU. Assets are not impaired below their then estimated fair values. To determine fair value the Company determined a fair value of a lease using a market rent. Market rent assumptions included useful life and discount rate. The estimate of fair value represents our best estimates of these factors and is subject to variability. Changes to the key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect our impairment evaluation.
​
Impairment: Contract Assets
​
The Company assesses contract assets for impairment when there is a significant change in facts and circumstances of the underlying contract in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”) and ASC 310, 
Receivables 
(“ASC 310”). Impairment loss is recognized when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the contract consideration to which it is entitled from the customer. The Company does not recognize any additional revenue from the underlying contract.
​
Impairment: Investments in Non-consolidated Entities and Non-marketable Equity Securities
​
For the Company’s investments in non-consolidated entities and non-marketable equity securities, the Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether any indicators of impairment exist in accordance with ASC 321, 
Investments — Equity Securities
 (“ASC 321”) and ASC 323, 
Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(“ASC 323”).
​

​
Common Stock Warrant Accounting 
​
The Company accounts for common stock warrants as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the respective warrant agreements. Common stock warrants that meet certain applicable requirements of ASC Subtopic 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
, and other related guidance, including the ability of the Company to settle the warrants without the issuance of registered shares or the absence of rights of the grantee to require cash settlement, are accounted for as equity instruments. The Company classifies these equity instruments within additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
Common stock warrants accounted for as equity instruments represent the warrants issued to Amazon and Walmart as discussed in Note 19, “Warrant Transaction Agreements”. The Company adopted FASB ASU 2019-08, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation
 (Topic 718) and 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606), which requires entities to measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer. 
​
 In order to calculate warrant charges, the Company used the Black-Scholes pricing model, which required key inputs including volatility and risk-free interest rate and certain unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of unvested warrants, considered to be probable of vesting, at the time. Based on that estimated fair value, the Company determined warrant charges, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 
​
Extended Maintenance Contracts
​
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure that has been sold. We measure loss accruals at the customer contract level. The expected revenues and expenses for these contracts include all applicable expected costs of providing services over the remaining term of the contracts and the related unearned net revenue. A loss is recognized if the sum of expected costs of providing services under the contract exceeds related unearned net revenue and is recorded as a provision for loss contracts related to service in the consolidated statements of operations. As we continue to work to improve quality and reliability, unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise and additional material charges may be incurred in the future. These quality issues could also adversely affect our contract loss accrual. The Company has undertaken and will undertake several other initiatives to extend the life and improve the reliability of its equipment. As a result of these initiatives and our additional expectation that the increase in certain costs will abate, the Company believes that its contract loss accrual is sufficient. However, if elevated service costs persist, the Company will adjust its estimated future service costs and increase its contract loss accrual estimate.
​
Product Warranty Reserve
​
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. Generally, sales of equipment and related infrastructure are accompanied by a 
one
 to 
two year
 standard warranty. These warranties are included in the estimates to complete the related programs. The Company also repairs or replaces certain products or parts found to be defective under normal use and service with an item of equivalent value, at our option, without charge during the warranty period. We quantify and record an estimate for warranty-related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and current repair costs. We adjust accruals as warranty claims data and historical experience warrant.
​
Fair Value Measurements
​
The Company records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement 
(“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
​
In addition to defining fair value, ASC 820 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which 
F-23

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
​
These levels are:
​
●
Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 — unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability at fair value.

Convertible Senior Notes
​
In May 2020, the Company issued $
212.5
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes”) as described in Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”. The Company exchanged $
138.8
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes for $
140.4
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes”), also described in Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”. The Company accounts for its 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes and its 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes as liabilities measured at amortized cost. The Company uses the effective interest rate method to amortize the debt issuance costs to interest expense over the respective term of the 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes and the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes.
​
On November 11, 2024, the Company entered into the Debenture Purchase Agreement with Yorkville pursuant to which the Company issued to Yorkville an unsecured convertible debenture in aggregate principal amount of $
200.0
 million (the “
6.00
% Convertible Debenture”) in exchange for the payment of $
190.0
 million, as described in Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”. The company elected to measure its 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. Each period the fair value of the notes will be remeasured and resulting gains/losses from change in fair value will be recognized within the consolidated statements of operations, except for any changes in instrument-specific credit risk which will be separately presented in other comprehensive income. Refer to Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements”, for further information. The Company has elected as an accounting policy to present interest expense separately from the changes in fair value of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture.
​
Subsequent Events
​
The Company evaluates subsequent events at the date of the balance sheet as well as conditions that arise after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements are issued. The effects of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Events and conditions arising after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements are issued are evaluated to determine if disclosure is required to keep the consolidated financial statements from being misleading. To the extent such events and conditions exist, if any, disclosures are made regarding the nature of events and the estimated financial effects for those events and conditions. See Note 29, “Subsequent Events”.

​
Climate Disclosures
​
In March 2024, the SEC issued Release No. 33-11275, 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors
, which includes final rules that enhance the transparency of climate-related disclosures and require companies to disclose material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks; information about the board of directors' oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition. Companies are also required to disclose the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the notes to the financial statements, and certain large companies are also required to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, when material. As a large accelerated filer, most disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025. The SEC has been the subject of various lawsuits since adopting these rules. As a result of ongoing litigation, the SEC issued an order in April 2024 to stay the effectiveness of the rules while judicial review is pending. We are continuing to monitor developments associated with these rules and are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

3. Acquisitions
​
Alloy Custom Products, LLC and WesMor Cryogenics, LLC
​
On December 5, 2022, the Company acquired 
two
 subsidiaries of Cryogenic Industrial Solutions, LLC, Alloy Custom Products, LLC, and WesMor Cryogenics, LLC (collectively, “CIS”). The CIS acquisition will allow the Company to increase its production capabilities for stainless steel and aluminum cryogenic transport truck-mounted cryogenic pressure vessels, cryogenic transport trailers, and other mobile storage containers.
​
The acquisition of CIS contributed $
46.5
 million, $
47.7
 million and $
3.7
 million to total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company determined that the net income from the CIS acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial.
​
The CIS acquisition was not considered material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position and, therefore, pro forma financial information is not presented.

​
Joule Processing LLC
​
On January 14, 2022, the Company acquired Joule Processing LLC (“Joule”), an engineered modular equipment, process design and procurement company founded in 2009.
​
The acquisition of Joule contributed $
9.5
 million, $
85.2
 million and $
36.5
 million to total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company determined that the net income from the Joule acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial.
​
The acquisition of Joule would have contributed 
$
36.8
 million and 
$
3.6
 million to total consolidated revenue and net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2021.

4. Investments
​
Available-for-sale and Equity Securities
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 investments classified as available-for-sale or equity securities. The Company received proceeds from the sales and maturities of its remaining available-for-sale securities totaling $
1.4
 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company received proceeds from the sales of its remaining equity securities totaling $
144.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.
​
We regularly review whether available-for-sale securities are other-than-temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). Available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if the Company will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery. If the Company determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the current fair value. The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $
10.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 for available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position due to a change in the Company’s ability and intent to retain these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the fair value. The other-than-temporary impairment charge was realized when the Company sold its remaining available-for-sale securities and equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
No
 such OTTI charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.
​
Investments in Non-consolidated Entities and Non-marketable Equity Securities
​
Non-marketable Equity Securities
​
Our investment in non-marketable equity securities was $

On December 10, 2024, HyVia announced that it entered into receivership proceedings opened by judgment of the Commercial Court of Versailles. This was the direct consequence of the slow emergence of hydrogen mobility ecosystems locally, coupled with significant development costs of hydrogen innovation and an insufficient regulatory environment. An observation period of six (6) months has been opened during which takeover or backing by new investors may be considered and a judicial trustee was appointed to carry out this process. Following expiry of the January 31, 2025 delay, with no offer of potential buyers having been received, HyVia has entered into a judicial liquidation proceeding opened by judgment of the Economic Activities Court of Versailles dated February 18, 2025 (judgment publication being still pending). As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s investment in HyVia was negative due to historical losses. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was committed to fund its share of losses of the joint venture and, therefore, continued to record losses as incurred. The negative equity investment was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets to the contingent consideration, loss accrual for service contracts, and other liabilities financial statement line item. During 2024, the Company recorded losses for HyVia which resulted in the investments in non-consolidated entities and non-marketable equity securities financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets related to HyVia to be $
0
 as of December 31, 2024.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company contributed approximately $
32.3
 million, $
2.9
 million, $
16.0
 million and $
17.4
 million, respectively, to HyVia, AccionaPlug S.L., SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2 Infra Fund.
​
The Company’s capital commitments related to its equity method investments as of December 31, 2024 was $
4.6
 million, all of which is expected to be paid during 2025.
​
5. 
Fair Value Measurements
​
The Company records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
​
In addition to defining fair value, ASC 820 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
​
F-27

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
These levels are:
​
●
Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 — unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability at fair value.
​
There were 
no
 transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2024. Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, such as our investments in HyVia, AccionaPlug S.L., SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2 Infra Fund.

The 
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that have unobservable inputs and are therefore categorized as Level 3 are related to the

 Convertible Debenture, as described in Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”, and contingent consideration.
​
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture
​
The fair value of the 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture as of December 31, 2024 is comprised of a single financial liability in which the Company elected the fair value option under ASC 825, 
Financial Instruments 
(“ASC 825”), with changes in fair value recorded in gain/loss from changes in fair value of 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company elected the fair value option due its multiple conversions features required to be presented at fair value. The Company has also elected to present interest expense separately from the changes in fair value of the 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture measured at fair value through earnings. Total changes in the fair value of the liability that resulted from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk will be separately recorded in other comprehensive income. There was no change in the instrument-specific credit risk during the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
The company estimated and recorded the fair value of the 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture upon its issuance date of November 12, 2024 at its cash value because it was negotiated at arm’s length. The fair value of the 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture as of December 31, 2024 was based on a Monte Carlo Simulation of stock price of the company on a daily basis and a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the amortization schedule, contingent on the daily simulated stock price. The valuation utilized significant Level 3 unobservable inputs, including implied yield, volatility, and risky discount rate. Other significant assumptions include risk-free rate, 
principal value,
 the Company’s common stock price, maturity date and the various conversion features and prices per the agreement. Significant judgment is required in selecting the significant inputs and assumptions. Actual assumptions may differ from our current estimates and such differences could materially impact fair value of the convertible note.
​
Refer to Note 17, “Convertible Senior Notes”, for the change in the carrying amount of the 
6.00
%
 Convertible Debenture for the year ended December 31, 2024.

​
Contingent consideration
​
The fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2024 is related to the Joule Processing LLC (“Joule”) acquisition in 2022 and the Frames Holding B.V. (“Frames”) acquisition in 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2023 is related to the Joule acquisition in 2022, the Frames acquisition in 2021 and the Giner ELX, Inc. (“Giner”) and United Hydrogen Group Inc. (“UHG”) acquisitions in 2020.
​
In connection with the Joule acquisition, the Company initially recorded on its consolidated balance sheets a liability of 
$
41.7
 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. The fair value of this contingent consideration was 
$
48.2
 million and 
$
75.5
 million as of 
December 
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to
 a 
decrease of 
$
14.3
 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, payments were made that reduced the fair value of the liability by 
$
13.0
 million
 during the year ended 
December 
31, 2024.
​
In connection with the Frames acquisition, the Company recorded on its consolidated balance sheets a liability of 
$
29.1
 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. The fair value of this contingent consideration was 
$
12.5
 million and 
$
31.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to payments that reduced the fair value of the liability by 
$
15.8
 million. In addition, a decrease of 
$
1.9
 million was recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Finally, the fair value of the liability decreased by 
$
1.6
 million due to foreign currency translation gains.
​
In connection with the UHG acquisition, 
the Company initially recorded on its consolidated balance sheets a liability of $
1.1
 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. 
The contingent consideration was fully settled during the second quarter of 2024 and the fair value of this contingent consideration was 
$
0.9
 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of 
$
0.9
 million was due to payments that reduced the fair value of the liability by 
$
1.0
 million during the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of 
$
0.1
 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended 
December 
31, 2024. The 
$
1.0
 million payment made during the second quarter of 2024 settled the remaining earn-out obligation.
​
In connection with the Giner acquisition, 
the Company initially recorded on its consolidated balance sheets a liability of $
16.0
 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. 
The contingent consideration was fully settled during the second quarter of 2024 and the fair value of this contingent consideration was 
$
18.0
 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of 
$
18.0
 million was due to payments that reduced the fair value of the liability by 
$
18.2
 million during the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of 
$
0.2
 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended 
December 
31, 2024. The $
18.2
 million payment during the second quarter of 2024 was paid in common stock and warrants and settled the remaining obligation of the earn-out. As part of the 
$
18.2
 million settlement of Giner’s earn-out obligation on May 24, 2024, the Company issued warrants to the sellers of Giner and the Company registered for resale up to 
3,461,371
 shares (the “Giner Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The exercise price of the Giner Warrant Shares was 
$
3.3008
 per share. The warrants had not been exercised as of December 31, 2024.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
​
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, impairment indicators may subject long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to non-recurring fair value measurements. During the fourth quarter of 2024, property, plant and equipment, net, intangible assets, net and right of use assets related to operating leases, net were written down to their estimated fair values. A decrease in demand of the global hydrogen market deteriorated cash flow projections which indicated that the carrying values of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The inputs to these models are considered to be Level 3 significant unobservable inputs.
​
The Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of the long-lived assets as of October 1, 2024 were:

6. Earnings Per Share
​
Basic earnings per common stock are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. In periods when we have net income, the shares of our common stock subject to the convertible notes outstanding during the period will be included in our diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method. Since the Company is in a net loss position, all common stock equivalents would be considered anti-dilutive and are therefore not included in the determination of diluted earnings per share. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share are the same.

​
8. Impairment
​
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recognized that sales and margin projections were likely not to be met for 2024. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company performed strategic planning, analyzing its various product lines, and it was determined at that time to update the future sales projections and related cash flow projections for certain of those product lines. As a result, there was a reduction in the cash flow projections during the fourth quarter of 2024 to several of the Company’s asset groups indicating that the carrying values of their long-lived assets (including property, plant, and equipment, equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers, and right of use assets related to operating leases) and finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable.
​
Asset groups are the unit of account for a long-lived asset or assets to be held and used which represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash flow projections for several asset groups was largely attributed to several factors, including the Company failing to meet 2024 sales and margin projections as well as decreased future cash flow projections across certain product lines including stationary, liquefiers and fuel cells for mobility projects related to HyVia. On December 10, 2024, HyVia announced that it entered into legal recovery proceedings recorded by the Commercial Court of Versailles. Additionally, the Company paused certain hydrogen production plant projects during the fourth quarter of 2024. This pause, as well as the decrease in cash flow projections, was primarily due to weakening demand in the global hydrogen market. As a result, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles by comparing the carrying values against undiscounted future cash flow projections and determined that an impairment existed.
​
During the fourth quarter of 2024, a significant amount of property, plant, and equipment were written down to their estimated fair values. The fair value for revenue generating assets was determined using a market approach utilizing prices for similar assets in active markets. The fair value for property, plant, and equipment was determined using a market approach, where available, and where not available, a cost approach. The fair value for equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers was determined using a discounted cash flow income approach considering estimated market rent. The fair value for right of use assets related to operating leases was determined using a discounted cash flow income approach considering estimated market rent. The fair values for finite-lived intangible assets were determined using the income approach.

949.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $
269.5
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in impairment was primarily due to impairment charges of $
902.2

902.2
 million, $
675.5
 million was related to property, plant and equipment, $

0.1
 million. Other impairment charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
8.4
 million, of which $
3.0
 million related to non-marketable equity securities and $
5.4
 million related to property, plant and equipment.
​
The impairment charge of $
269.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the impairment of goodwill of $
249.5
 million as well as $
2.4
 million related to contract assets, $
9.7
 million related to other current assets, $
3.1
 million related to property, plant and equipment, $

0.2
 million related to equipment related to power purchase agreements and fuel delivered to customers.
​
To the extent there are further changes in market conditions or the performance of the Company’s long-lived assets, there is a possibility that the Company could incur additional impairment charges in the future.

14. Operating and Finance Lease Liabilities 
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had operating leases, as lessee, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions that are partially secured by restricted cash, security deposits and pledged escrows (see also Note 1, “Nature of Operations”) as summarized below. These leases expire over the next 
one
 to 
six years
. Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
​
Leases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of cancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the Company may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the lessor to renew the lease at market rental rates. No residual value guarantees are contained in the leases. No financial covenants are contained within the lease, however there are customary operational covenants such as assurance the Company properly maintains the leased assets and carries appropriate insurance, etc. The leases include credit support in the form of either cash, collateral or letters of credit. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for a description of cash held as security associated with the leases.
​
The Company has finance leases associated with its property and equipment in Latham, New York and at fueling customer locations.

 Convertible Debenture
​
On November 11, 2024, the Company entered into the Debenture Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued to Yorkville the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture in exchange for the payment of $
190.0
 million. The 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture was issued in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture ranks pari passu in right of payment with all other outstanding and future senior indebtedness of the Company.

The 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture bears interest at a rate of 
6.00
% per annum and is payable on the second year anniversary of the issuance date of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture (the “Maturity Date”) or earlier redemption date. The interest rate will increase to a rate of 
16.0
% per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture.

The 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture provides that Yorkville may convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, at an initial conversion price of $
2.90
 (the “Fixed Price”), representing a conversion premium of 
146
% to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on November 11, 2024. In certain circumstances, Yorkville will be permitted to convert up to $
22.5
 million aggregate principal amount of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, each calendar month beginning with December 2024, at a conversion price equal to the lower of the (1) Fixed Price and (2) 
97.25
% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price for the Company’s common stock during the 
three
 trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion date (the “Market Price”); provided that such Market Price is not less than $
0.3941
 (the “Floor Price”). The Fixed Price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including if the Company issues shares of common stock at price per share that is less than the Fixed Price or certain convertible securities with a conversion price that is less than the Fixed Price (the “Dilutive Price”), in which case the Fixed Price would be adjusted to equal the Dilutive Price, subject to certain exceptions. Yorkville is not permitted to convert the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture to the extent that the shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion thereof would exceed 
19.99
% of the Company’s outstanding shares immediately prior to executing the Debenture Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”) without prior stockholder approval.

If (1) the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is below the Floor Price for a specified period of time, (2) the Company has issued more than 
99
% of the shares of common stock available under the Exchange Cap or (3) a registration default has occurred with respect to the resale registration statement registering the shares of Common Stock potentially underlying the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture, then Yorkville may require the Company to redeem or convert, at the Company’s discretion, $
22.5
 million of the principal amount of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture, a premium thereon equal to 
2.75
% of such principal amount and accrued interest thereon on a monthly basis, unless and until such event is cured in accordance with the provisions of the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture.

The Company has the right to redeem the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture if the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is less than the Fixed Price at a redemption price equal to 
102.75
% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company also has the right to redeem the 
6.00
% Convertible Debenture if the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is equal to or greater than the product of 
1.3793
 and the Fixed Price at a redemption price equal to 
102.75
% of the 
principal
 amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon or, in certain circumstances, 
105.0
% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

On March 20, 2024, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the Company’s outstanding 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to which the Company exchanged $
138.8
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes, and accrued and unpaid interest of $
1.6
 million on such notes to, but excluding, March 20, 2024, for $
140.4
 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s new 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, in each case, pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. Following the exchange, approximately $
58.5
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged.
​
This transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
14.0
 million in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2024. Loss on extinguishment of debt arises from the difference between the net carrying amount of the Company’s debt and the fair value of the assets transferred to extinguish the debt.
​
The 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are governed by the terms of an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of March 20, 2024, entered into between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes bear cash interest at the rate of 
7.00
% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2024, to holders of record at the close of business on the preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively. The 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier converted or redeemed or repurchased by the Company.

​
The conversion rate for the 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes is initially 
235.4049
 shares of the Company’s common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount of 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
4.25
 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 
20
% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 12, 2024. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2025, the 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of the 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after December 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the

Subject to certain exceptions and subject to certain conditions, holders of the 
7.00

7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) prior to maturity for cash at a repurchase price equal to

​
The 
7.00

In certain circumstances, conversions of 
7.00
% Convertible Senior Notes in connection with “Make-Whole Fundamental Changes” (as defined in the Indenture) or conversions of

The estimated fair value of the

​
Capped Call 
​
In conjunction with the pricing of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “
3.75
% Notes Capped Call”) with certain counterparties at a price of $
16.2
 million. The 
3.75
% Notes Capped Call covers, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that underlie the initial 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes 
and 
is generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 
3.75
% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the 
3.75
% Notes Capped Call is initially $
6.7560
 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 
60
%

over the last then-reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $
4.11
 per share on the date of the transaction and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 
3.75
% Notes Capped Call. The 
3.75
% Notes Capped Call becomes exercisable if the conversion option is exercised.

15,000,000
 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will vest in multiple tranches over the 
7
-year term of the 2022 Amazon Warrant based on payments made to the Company directly by Amazon or its affiliates, or indirectly through third parties, with 
15,000,000
 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares fully vesting if Amazon-related payments of $
2.1
 billion are made in the aggregate. The exercise price for the first 
9,000,000
 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares is $
22.9841
 per share and the fair value on the grant date was $
20.36
. The exercise price for the remaining 
7,000,000
 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will be an amount per share equal to

9,000,000
 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares. The 2022 Amazon Warrant is exercisable through August 24, 2029. 
​
Upon the consummation of certain change of control transactions (as defined in the 2022 Amazon Warrant) prior to the vesting of at least 
60
% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, the 2022 Amazon Warrant will automatically vest and become exercisable with respect to an additional number of 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares such that 
60
% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares shall have vested. If a change of control transaction is consummated after the vesting of at least 
60
% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, then no acceleration of vesting will occur with respect to any of the unvested 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares as a result of the transaction. The exercise price and the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the 2022 Amazon Warrant are subject to customary antidilution adjustments. 
​
On August 24, 2022, 
1,000,000
 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares associated with tranche 1 vested. The warrant fair value associated with the vested shares of tranche 1 of $

As of December 31, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 3 was $
0.2
 million. Because the exercise price has yet to be determined, if probable of vesting, the fair value of tranche 4 will be remeasured at each reporting period end and amortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement.

Option Awards
​
The Company issues options that become exercisable based on time and/or market conditions and are classified as equity awards. 
​
Service Stock Options Awards
​
To date, service-based stock option awards (“Service Stock Options”) granted under the 2011 and 2021 Plans have vesting provisions ranging from 
one
 to 
three years
 in duration and expire 
ten years
 after issuance. Service Stock Options for employees issued under these plans generally vest in equal annual installments over 
three years
 and expire 
ten years
 after issuance. Service Stock Options granted to members of the Board generally vest 
one year
 after issuance. The Company estimates the fair value of the Service Stock Options using a Black-Scholes valuation model, and the resulting fair value is recorded as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the option vesting period. Key inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Service Stock Options include the grant price of the award, the expected option term, volatility of the Company’s stock, an appropriate risk-free rate, and the Company’s dividend yield. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company. The assumptions made for purposes of estimating fair value under the Black-Scholes model for the

​
Market Condition Stock Option Awards
​
The Company grants market condition stock options awards under the 2021 plan to the Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers. These market condition stock options awards are subject to both market conditions, tied to the achievement of stock price hurdles, and time-based vesting; therefore, a Monte Carlo Simulation was utilized to determine the grant-date fair value with the associated expense recognized over the requisite service period. Up to 
one
 third (1/3) the market condition stock options awards will vest and become exercisable on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period in the 
three-year
 performance period following the grant date of the stock options (“VWAP”) equals or exceeds certain levels.
​
The Company granted 
2,452,500
 and 
500,000
 market condition stock options awards on April 26, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. Options that meet the market conditions will vest 
1
/3 on each for the first three anniversaries of the grant date. The market condition stock options awards will be deemed to have satisfied the market condition and will be eligible to be exercised if the VWAP equals $
7.50
 at any point between the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date.
​
Failure to achieve any of the stock price hurdles applicable to a market condition stock options awards during the 
three-year
 performance period will result in the applicable options not becoming exercisable. The market condition stock options awards have a maximum term of 
seven
 to 
ten years
 from the grant date.
​
Key inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of market condition stock options awards include the grant price of the awards, the expected option term, VWAP hurdle rates, volatility of the Company’s stock, an appropriate risk-free rate, and the Company’s dividend yield. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance, as a result of uncertainties related to the realization of its net deferred tax asset, at December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $

 million, respectively.

The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the U.S., which remain fully reserved. Except for a few service entities mainly in Europe, all deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s Netherlands subsidiary established a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets that will not be realized.
​
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the use of loss carryforwards may be limited if a change in ownership of a company occurs. If it is determined that due to transactions involving the Company’s shares owned by its 5 percent or greater stockholders a change of ownership has occurred under the provisions 
F-54

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
of Section 382 of the Code, the Company’s federal and state NOL carryforwards could be subject to significant Section 382 limitations.
​
The Company’s deferred tax assets include $
3.0
 billion of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. The NOL carryforwards available at December 31, 2024, include $
2.9
 billion of NOL that was generated in 2018 through 2024, that do not expire. The remainder, if unused, will expire at various dates from 2033 through 2037. Based on analysis of stock transactions, an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Code occurred in 2013, which imposes a $
13.5
 million limit on the utilization of pre-change losses that can be used to offset taxable income in future years. The pre-change NOL carryforwards will expire, if unused, at various dates from 2025 through 2033. The Company continuously analyzes stock transactions and has determined that no ownership changes have occurred since 2013 that would further limit the utilization of NOLs. Therefore, NOLs of $
3.0
 billion incurred in post-change years are not subject to limitation. 
​
Approximately $
24.7
 million of research credit carryforwards generated after the most recent IRC Section 382 ownership change are included in the Company’s deferred tax assets. Due to limitations under IRC Section 382, research credit carryforwards existing prior to the most recent IRC Section 382 ownership change will not be used and are not reflected in the Company’s gross deferred tax asset at December 31, 2024. The remaining credit carryforwards will expire during the periods 2033 through 2042.
​
At December 31, 2024, the Company has unused Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
3.5
 million. The net operating loss carryforwards if unused will expire at various dates between 2041 through 2044. At December 31, 2024, the Company has no remaining Scientific Research and Experimental Development (“SR&ED”) expenditures or ITC credit carryforwards. 
​
At December 31, 2024, the Company has unused French net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
96.3
 million. The net operating loss may carry forward indefinitely or until the Company changes its activity. 
​
At December 31, 2024, the Company has unused Netherlands net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
41.4
 million. The net operating loss may carry forward indefinitely or until the Company changes its activity.
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has 
no
 un-repatriated foreign earnings or unrecognized tax benefits.
​
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Key provisions under the IRA include a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax imposed on certain large corporations and the extension and expansion of clean energy tax incentives. The 15% corporate alternative minimum tax is not expected to affect the Company in the near future. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the clean energy tax incentives on its businesses and is awaiting U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service guidance.
​
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities. Open tax years in the U.S. range from 2021 and forward. Open tax years in the foreign jurisdictions range from 2014 and forward. However, upon examination in subsequent years, if net operating losses carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are utilized, the US and foreign jurisdictions can reduce net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards utilized in the year being examined if they do not agree with the carryforward amount. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s French subsidiary was under audit for income tax years 2022 and 2023. The Company is not under audit in the U.S. or any other non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions.
​
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development costs pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. The requirement was effective for the Company beginning after December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $
44.8
 million due to Section 174 capitalization. We note that the Company is currently in a full valuation allowance as it relates to the U.S. taxing jurisdiction as a result there is no impact to cash taxes payable.
​
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting has proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on multi-national corporations, commonly referred to as the Pillar Two rules that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. While the United States has not 
F-55

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
adopted the Pillar Two rules, numerous foreign countries have enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules, effective beginning January 1, 2024, or are expected to enact similar legislation. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not meet the consolidated revenue threshold and is not subject to the GloBE Rules under Pillar Two. The Company will continue to monitor the implementation of rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
​
23. Commitments and Contingencies
​
Restricted Cash 
​
In connection with certain of the noted sale/leaseback agreements, cash of $
476.2
 million and $
573.5
 million, respectively, was required to be restricted as security as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which will be released over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also had certain letters of credit backed by security deposits totaling $
276.4
 million and $
370.7
 million, respectively, of which $
242.7
 million and $
340.0
 million are security for the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, respectively, and $
33.7
 million and $
30.7
 million are customs related letters of credit, respectively.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
73.7
 million and $
76.8
 million, respectively, held in escrow related to the construction of certain hydrogen production plants.
​
The Company also had $
1.2
 million of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with the Joule acquisition reported as restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, with a corresponding accrued liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also had $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with the CIS acquisition reported as restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a corresponding accrued liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company had $
7.4
 million and $
11.7
 million in restricted cash as collateral resulting from the Frames acquisition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​
Litigation
​
Legal matters are handled in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of any such matters, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the likelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to considerable judgment. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. While we are not in a position to accurately predict the outcome of any legal or other proceedings, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if material, or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. Except for a $
0.6
 million accrual relating to a settled matter subject to pending court approval, which has not been paid as of December 31, 2024, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be currently estimated.

Securities Litigation and Related Stockholder Derivative Litigation

2021 Securities Action and Related Derivative Litigation

One action is pending in which alleged stockholders of the Company assert claims derivatively, on the Company’s behalf, based on allegations and claims that were asserted in 
In re Plug Power, Inc. Securities Litigation
, No. 1:21-cv-2004 (S.D.N.Y.), an earlier putative securities class action that is no longer pending (the “2021 Securities Action”). In an opinion and order entered in August 2023, the district court dismissed the 2021 Securities Action with prejudice, and the plaintiffs in that action did not appeal.

A consolidated stockholder derivative action relating to the claims and allegations in the 2021 Securities Action is pending in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, styled 
In re Plug Power Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation
, Cons. C.A. No. 2022-0569-KSJM (Del. Ch.). By stipulation and order, the action was stayed until motions to dismiss were finally resolved in the 2021 Securities Action. On March 8, 2024, the alleged stockholder plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint asserting claims against our officers Andrew J. Marsh, Paul B. Middleton, Gerard L. 
F-56

​
Conway, Jr., and Keith Schmid, and against our current or former directors George C. McNamee, Gary K. Willis, Maureen O. Helmer, Johannes M. Roth, Gregory L. Kenausis, Lucas Schneider, and Jonathan Silver. The Company is named as nominal defendant. Primarily based on allegations in the 2021 Securities Action, the plaintiffs assert claims against the individual defendants for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, disgorgement, and unjust enrichment based on alleged transactions in the Company’s securities while allegedly in possession of material non-public information concerning (i) the Company’s financial accounting prior to the announcement that the Company would need to restate certain financial statements and (ii) the potential amendment and termination of a warrant agreement between the Company and a significant customer. On May 10, 2024, the Company, as nominal defendant, and all of the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss (a) for failure to make a pre-suit demand or to adequately allege demand futility and (b) by the individual defendants, for failure to state a claim. Oral argument on the motion was held on November 4, 2024.

2023 Securities Action and Related Derivative Litigation

A consolidated action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware asserting claims under the federal securities laws against the Company and certain of its senior officers on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s securities, styled 
In re Plug Power, Inc. Securities Litigation
, No. 1:23-cv-00576-MN (the “2023 Securities Action”). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on September 28, 2023, in which they assert claims under the federal securities laws against the Company and four of its senior officers, Mr. Marsh, Mr. Middleton, Sanjay Shrestha, and former officer David Mindnich, on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between January 19, 2022 and March 1, 2023. The complaint alleges that the defendants made “materially false and/or misleading statements” about the Company’s business and operations, including the Company’s revenue goals for 2022, its ability to effectively manage its supply chain and product manufacturing, and its progress in construction of new hydrogen production capacity. On February 4, 2025, the Court issued an opinion and order dismissing the consolidated complaint, with leave to replead. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 25, 2025. The Company and the other defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on a schedule to be negotiated.

Beginning on September 13, 2023, three separate actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting claims derivatively, on behalf of the Company, against certain former and current Company officers and directors based on the allegations and claims in the 2023 Securities Action. Those cases have been consolidated in the District of Delaware under the caption 
In re Plug Power, Inc. Stockholder Deriv. Litig.
, No. 1:23-cv-01007-MN (D. Del.). The defendants named in the constituent complaint were Mr. Marsh, Mr. Middleton, Mr. Mindnich, Martin Hull, Ms. Helmer, Mr. Kenausis, Mr. McNamee, Mr. Schneider, Mr. Silver, Mr. Willis, and current or former directors Jean Bua, Kavita Mahtani, and Kyungyeol Song. In an order entered on April 26, 2024, the Court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay all proceedings until motions to dismiss have been resolved in the 2023 Securities Action.

2024 Securities Litigation

On March 22, 2024, Ete Adote filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York asserting claims under the federal securities laws against the Company, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. Middleton, on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between May 9, 2023 and January 16, 2024, styled 
Adote v. Plug Power, Inc. et al.
, No. 1:24-cv-00406-MAD-DJS (N.D.N.Y.). The complaint alleges that the defendants made misstatements concerning the Company’s progress in construction of new hydrogen production capacity and its ability to effectively manage its supply chain. On April 30, 2024, a second complaint asserting substantially similar claims against the same defendants, but on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between March 1, 2023 and January 16, 2024, was filed in the Northern District of New York, styled 
Lee v. Plug Power, et al.
, No. 1:24;cv-0598-MAD-DJS (N.D.N.Y.). The Court has approved stipulations in both actions extending the time for all defendants to respond to any pleading until after the Court appoints lead plaintiff(s).

Other Litigation

On May 2, 2023, a lawsuit entitled 
Jacob Thomas and JTurbo Engineering & Technology, LLC v. Joule Processing, LLC and Plug Power Inc.
, Case No. 4:23-cv-01615, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Joule Processing, LLC and the Company. The only claims that remain are misappropriation of trade secrets under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 U.S.C. § 1836, misappropriation 
F-57

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
of trade secrets under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, and breach of contract. The Parties entered into a settlement agreement that resolves this suit, and intent to file a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice by March 31, 2025.

On July 24, 2023, an action entitled 
Felton v. Plug Power, Inc.
, Case No. 1:23-cv-887, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York asserting claims against the Company pursuant to the New York State Human Rights Law. The complaint asserts that the plaintiff is seeking damages to redress injuries suffered as a result of harassment and discrimination on the basis of his race, together with creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation. The Company disagrees with plaintiff’s representations about his time at the Company and intends to vigorously defend against his allegations. Plaintiff’s counsel moved to withdraw from the case, which the court approved on March 18, 2024, and therefore plaintiff is now 
pro se
. The discovery deadline was February 28, 2025.

On October 23, 2024, a case entitled 
First Solar, Inc. v. Plug Power Inc.
, Index No. 655610/2024 was filed in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County, asserting a claim for breach of contract associated with a purchase order for solar panels manufactured by First Solar to be purchased by the Company. The complaint seeks monetary relief along with pre-judgment interest.
​
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
​
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and marketable securities. Cash and restricted cash are maintained in accounts with financial institutions which, at times, may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $
250
 thousand. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant. The Company’s available-for-sale securities consists primarily of investments in U.S. Treasury securities and short-term high credit quality corporate debt securities. Equity securities are comprised of fixed income and equity market index mutual funds. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities or equity securities.
​
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables exist due to the limited number of select customers with whom the Company has initial commercial sales arrangements. To mitigate credit risk, the Company performs appropriate evaluation of a prospective customer’s financial condition.
​
As of December 31, 2024, 
one
 customer individually exceeded 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable with a balance of $
38.5
 million, or 
24.5
%, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023,

Guarantee
​
On May 30, 2023, our joint venture, HyVia, entered into a government grant agreement with Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, was required to issue a guarantee to Bpifrance in the amount of €
20.0
 million through the end of January 2027. Plug Power France is liable to the extent of the guarantee for sums due to Bpifrance from HyVia under the agreement based on the difference between the total amount paid by Bpifrance and the final amount certified by HyVia and Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, there are certain milestones that HyVia is required to meet, and the nonperformance of these milestones or termination of this agreement could result in this guarantee being called upon. As of December 31, 2024, 
no
 payments related to this guarantee have been made. The

​
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
​
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, take or pay contracts and service agreements. For certain vendors, the Company’s unconditional obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of raw materials at an agreed upon price is fixed and determinable; while certain other raw material costs will vary due to product forecasting and future economic conditions.
​
Future payments under non-cancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of 
December

24. Segment and Geographic Area Reporting
​
Our organization is managed from a sales perspective based on “go-to-market” sales channels, emphasizing shared learning across end-user applications and common supplier/vendor relationships. These sales channels are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services. As a result of this structure, we concluded that we have 
one
 operating and 
reportable segment
 – the design, development and sale of hydrogen products and solutions that help customers meet their business goals while decarbonizing their operations. Our chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). All significant operating decisions made by management are based upon analysis of Plug on a total company basis, including assessments related to our incentive compensation plans. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
​
The information regularly provided to the CODM used to assess performance and allocate resources is the same as the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources is consolidated net loss which is presented in the consolidated statements of operations. The CODM uses net loss in strategic planning, for example, decision making of whether to allocate resources towards strengthening sales channels, investing in research and development, focusing on cost-down initiatives, and/or analyzing company overhead in respect to specific products and service lines. Net loss is also used to monitor budget versus actual results and is considered in assessments related to company-wide incentive compensation.  The significant segment expenses included within the segment measure of profit or loss are total costs of revenue, research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense, and impairment expense. Other segment items are comprised of restructuring, change in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, other expense, net, realized loss on investments, net, change in fair value of equity securities, loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes and debt, change in fair value of convertible senior note, loss on equity method investments, income tax benefit and net loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which are presented in the consolidated statements of operations. The CODM is not regularly provided a measure of segment assets.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized related party revenue of $
5.0
 million, $
13.9
 million and $
5.2
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had related party outstanding accounts receivable of $

​
26. Restructuring
​
In February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance our financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a competitive market, we approved a comprehensive initiative that encompassed a broad range of measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). These measures were aimed at increasing efficiency, improving scalability, and maintaining our leadership position in the renewable energy industry. We began executing the 2024 Restructuring Plan in February 2024 and it was effectively completed during the fourth quarter of 2024.
​
The determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. We account for involuntary termination benefits that are provided pursuant to one-time benefit arrangements in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) whereas involuntary termination benefits that are part of an ongoing written or substantive plan are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits (“ASC 712”). We accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 420 in the period in which the plan is communicated to the employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory requirements, we accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 712 when the existing situation or set of circumstances indicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be paid within the next twelve months.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $
8.2
 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of $
6.9
 million and other restructuring costs of $
1.3
 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Severance expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 in accordance with ASC 420 was a result of the separation of full-time employees associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan. As of December 31, 2024, $
0.1
 million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, other restructuring costs were represented by (1) $
0.2
 million of legal and professional services costs, and (2) $
1.1
 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. As of December 31, 2024, $
28
 thousand of accrued other restructuring costs were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during 2025.
​
27. Government Assistance
​
Government assistance represents benefits provided by federal, state, or local governments that are not subject to the scope of ASC 740. We recognize a grant when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the grant’s conditions and that the grant will be received. Government assistance whose primary condition is the purchase, construction, or acquisition of a long-lived asset are considered asset-based assistance and are recognized as a reduction to such asset’s cost-basis, which reduces future depreciation. Other government assistance not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based assistance, which are recognized as a reduction to the research and development expense financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations in the amounts of $
1.8
 million and $
0
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​
In August 2022, former President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law. The IRA contains numerous credits and incentives that are relevant to the Company including: (i) a new Section 45V Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen, which provides a PTC of up to $3 per kg of qualified clean hydrogen over a 10-year credit period for the production of qualified clean hydrogen at a qualified facility in the United States; (ii) an extension and amendment of the Section 48 ITC for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties, including fuel cell technology; (iii) a new Section 48 Investment Tax Credit for Energy Storage Technologies, which expands the applicability of the investment tax credit to include standalone energy storage projects, among other things; and (iv) a new Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which provides a tax credit for investment in facilities that generate clean electricity, among other provisions.
​

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
Section 45V Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen
​
Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that it qualifies for the clean hydrogen PTC under Section 45V of the Internal Revenue Code resulting from operation of the Company’s hydrogen production plant located in Georgia. The PTC is available for qualified clean hydrogen produced and sold during the 10-year period beginning on the date the qualified clean hydrogen production facility was originally placed in service. The Company has chosen elective pay, also referred to as direct pay, for the 2024 taxable year. This election makes the PTC refundable, as the Company can receive the full value of the credit from the Internal Revenue Service. This election will apply to the 2024 taxable year and the 
four
 subsequent taxable years unless revoked. During the remaining 
five years
 of the 10-year period to receive the PTC, the Company can elect to transfer all or a portion of the PTC to a third party buyer in exchange for cash.
​
As the PTC is a refundable credit (i.e., a credit with a direct-pay option available), the PTC is outside the scope of ASC 740. Therefore, the Company has analogized the accounting of the PTC to accounting for government grants due to the ability to receive payment for the credit regardless of whether the Company has an income tax liability. Under a government grant model, once it is reasonably assured that the entity will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant money should be recognized on a systematic basis over the period in which the entity recognizes the related expenses or losses for which the grant money is intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once it is probable that both of the following conditions will be met: (1) the Company is eligible to receive the grant and (2) the Company is able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grant.
​
With respect to the PTC, based on our current production, the Company expects to qualify for the full $3 per kg credit. For the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company recognized PTC of $
4.0
 million as a reduction to the fuel delivered to customers and related equipment costs of revenue financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations and $
4.5
 million as an increase to the 
other assets
 financial statement line item in the consolidated balance sheets.
​
Section 48 Credit for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties of Energy Storage Technologies
​
As of December 31, 2024 the Company determined that it qualifies for the Section 48 ITC for Qualified Fuel Cell Properties of Energy Storage Technologies related to its hydrogen storage and liquefaction assets at its Georgia hydrogen plant. A base rate credit of 6% is available to qualified energy storage property in the year that it is placed in-service, with availability of increased credit rates if the property qualifies. The Company determined that it qualified for a rate credit of 30%. As the ITC is considered a transferable tax credit, the Company is accounting for it as a grant related to assets. Therefore, the ITC is recognized as a reduction to the Georgia hydrogen production plant’s cost-basis, recognized within the “property, plant, and equipment, net” financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets, which will reduce future depreciation over the next 
30 years
. The amount of the ITC, which is recognized in the prepaid expenses, tax credits, and other current assets financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, was $
31.3
 million.

28. Variable Interest Entities
​
Hidrogenii
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power LA JV, LLC, created a joint venture with Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Olin, named “Hidrogenii” in the third quarter of 2022. We believe Hidrogenii will support reliability of supply and speed to market for hydrogen throughout North America and set the foundation for broader collaboration between Plug and Olin. Hidrogenii began the construction of a 
15
-ton-per-day hydrogen plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. Hidrogenii is owned 
50
% by Plug Power LA JV, LLC and 
50
% by Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC.
​
The Company has determined Hidrogenii to be a VIE, and the Company is considered to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary, as we determined we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On an ongoing basis, we are contractually obligated to certain operational capital funding. We consolidate the joint venture’s results within our single consolidated reportable segment. Hidrogenii has similar risks to

​
2025 Restructuring Plan
​
On March 3, 2025, the Company announced the 2025 Restructuring Plan. The 2025 Restructuring Plan includes initiatives to reduce our workforce, realign the Company’s manufacturing footprint and streamline the organization to enhance operational efficiency and improve overall liquidity. The expected annual savings from the 2025 Restructuring Plan are expected to be significant and will begin to be realized beginning in the second half of 2025.
​
Standby Equity Purchase Agreement
​
On February 10, 2025, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) entered into that certain Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with YA II PN, LTD, an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP. (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to the Investor up to $
1
 billion in the aggregate gross sales price (the “Commitment Amount”) of its common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share (the “Common Stock”), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Company is under no obligation to sell any of its Common Stock to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement. Upon the satisfaction of the conditions to the Investor’s purchase obligation set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including having an effective registration statement and a prospectus supplement registering the resale of the Common Stock issuable under the Purchase Agreement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, from time to time at its discretion (until the Purchase Agreement is terminated) to direct the Investor to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock (in each case, an “Advance”), up to $
10.0
 million per day, by delivering written notice to the Investor. The Common Stock purchased pursuant to an Advance delivered by the Company will be purchased at a price equal to 
95
% of the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock.
​

The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of Common Stock to the Investor. Actual sales of Common Stock to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company and its management from time to time, which may include, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company and its management as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company’s business and operations.
F-63

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
​
​

Unless earlier terminated, the Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) February 10, 2027 and (ii) the date on which all shares of Common Stock equal to the Commitment Amount have been issued and sold under the Purchase Agreement. Neither the Company nor the Investor may assign its rights and obligations under the Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, and no provision of the Purchase Agreement may be modified by the Company or the Investor other than by an instrument in writing signed by both parties.
​
As consideration for the Investor’s commitment to purchase the Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Investor a commitment fee in the amount of $
1,000,000
.
​
The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells its Common Stock to the Investor. The Company expects that any proceeds received from such sales to the Investor will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
​
ITC Sale
​
On January 24, 2025, the Company transferred its ITC via sale to a third party for $
31.3
 million in cash.
​
Finalized DOE Loan Guarantee

1.66
 billion through the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (the “DOE Loan Program”) to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to 
six
 green hydrogen production facilities (each a “Facility” and, together, the “Facilities”).
​
On January 16, 2025, (i) the Borrower, the DOE, acting by and through the Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Financing Bank (the “FFB”) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “FFB Note Purchase Agreement”) in respect of which, among other things, the DOE provided a guarantee of (x) the Borrower’s obligations to repay term loan borrowings and capitalized interest (such loans and capitalized interest, collectively, the “Guaranteed Loan”) provided by the FFB to the Borrower and evidenced by an initial future advance promissory note (the “FFB Promissory Note”) and (y) the Borrower’s other obligations owing to FFB in respect of the Guaranteed Loan and (ii) in connection and concurrently therewith, the Borrower and Plug Power Limestone, LLC (the “Limestone Project Company”), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Loan Guarantee Agreement (the “DOE Loan Guarantee Agreement”) with the DOE.
