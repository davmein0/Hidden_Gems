Background 
​
Plug is building an end-to-end clean hydrogen ecosystem, from production, storage, and delivery to energy generation, to help its customers meet their business goals and decarbonize the economy. In creating the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cells, the Company has deployed more than 72,000 fuel cell systems for forklifts and more than 275 fueling stations. Plug intends to deliver its hydrogen solutions directly to its customers, and through joint venture partners into multiple environments, including material handling, supply chain and logistics, e-mobility, stationary power generation and industrial applications.
​
Plug is focused on delivering a number of hydrogen solutions to its customers. Its vertically integrated end-to-end hydrogen solutions, which are designed to fit individual customer needs, include hydrogen production equipment or the delivery of hydrogen fuel, including:
●
Fuel cells
: Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and heat without combustion. Plug offers stationary and mobility fuel cell products to its customers in addition to serving the material handling industry. Plug’s fuel cells power material handling vehicles (forklifts), replacing lead-acid batteries. Plug supports customers at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where Plug’s fuel cell products provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits.
●
Proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzers
: Plug electrolyzers use clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Using electrolyzers, customers can generate hydrogen for a variety of applications. PEM technology delivers high power density, carries low weight and volume and operates at relatively low temperatures which allows it to start quickly and cause less wear and tear on the system. In support of the market growth and its own ambitions, Plug has built a state-of-the-art gigafactory to produce electrolyzer stacks in Rochester, New York. 
●
Hydrogen liquefiers
: Plug has a core competency in liquefaction systems known for their operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. Plug’s hydrogen liquefaction system has one of the most energy-efficient designs on the market utilizing hydrogen as the refrigerant in the main liquefaction cycle. 
●
Liquid hydrogen cryogenic solutions
: Plug has expertise designing and manufacturing cryogenic solutions, including liquid storage tanks, delivery trailers, vaporizers, portable equipment, and integrated control systems. The Plug hydrogen tanker is one of the largest and lightest trailers currently manufactured, with significant over-the-road payloads.
●
Hydrogen production
: In addition to its pre-existing hydrogen production plant in Tennessee, Plug began producing liquid hydrogen at its hydrogen facility in Kingsland, Georgia in January 2024. Also, Plug’s hydrogen production plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana is on schedule, as previously announced, for operations in the first quarter of 2025, now entering the final commissioning phase, and Plug continues to progress additional new hydrogen production plants throughout the United States, including in New York and Texas.
​
We were organized as a corporation in the State of Delaware on June 27, 1997.
​
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Company,” “Plug,” “we,” “our,” or “us” as used herein refer to Plug Power Inc. and its subsidiaries.
​
Business Strategy

Business Organization
​
The Company continues to evolve its organizational design to meet the growing needs of the business and product offerings and align with the strategy discussed above. Our organization is managed from a sales perspective based on “go-to-market” sales channels, emphasizing shared learning across end-user applications and common supplier/vendor relationships. These sales channels are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services. As a result of this structure, we concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment — the design, development and sale of hydrogen products and solutions that help customers meet their business goals while decarbonizing their operations. Our chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). All significant operating decisions made by management are largely based upon the analysis of Plug on a total company basis, including assessments related to our incentive compensation plans. The current organizational structure is designed to help Plug achieve its goals and establish Plug as a world leader in clean hydrogen solutions.
​
Products and Services
​
Plug is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly electrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions.
​
While we continue to develop commercially viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions, we have 
expanded our offerings to support a variety of commercial operations that can be powered with clean hydrogen. We provide electrolyzers that allow customers — such as refineries, producers of chemicals, steel, fertilizer and commercial refueling stations — to generate hydrogen on-site
. 
We are focusing our efforts on (a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) production of hydrogen; and (c) stationary power systems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and generation facilities, in either a backup power or continuous power role, and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for telecommunication logistics, transportation, and utility customers. Plug expects to support these products and customers with an ecosystem of vertically integrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for mobility and power applications.

Markets, Geography and Customer Concentration
​
The Company’s products and services predominantly serve the North American, European and Asian material handling markets, and primarily support large to mid-sized fleet, multi shift operations in high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution centers. The Company has historically experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results, with more revenue typically recognized in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half.
​
Customer demand for clean hydrogen has grown as a low-carbon energy source for hard-to-decarbonize industries, such as heavy-duty transportation, heavy manufacturing (steel, cement, aluminum, and chemicals), stationary power generation, and aviation. Orders for the Company’s products and services approximated $890.6 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s orders at any given time are comprised of fuel cells, hydrogen installations, maintenance services, electrolyzers, liquefiers, hydrogen trailers, and hydrogen fuel deliveries. The specific elements of the orders have varied terms of timing of delivery and can vary between 90 days to 10 years, with fuel cells and hydrogen installations being delivered near term and maintenance services and hydrogen fuel deliveries being delivered over a longer period of time.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Walmart, Inc. (“Walmart”), accounted for 16.6% of our total consolidated revenues, which included a provision for warrant charge of $19.6 million. Additionally, 14.4% of our total consolidated revenues were associated with our second largest customer.
​
Working Capital Items
​
We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production and for the purposes of global supply chain risk management. We consider the component parts of our different products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. However, we have seen shortages of materials needed to produce fuel cell and hydrogen generation equipment components due to general supplier performance, labor shortages, supply chain constraints and logistical challenges. These material shortages have also negatively impacted the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company.
​
Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships
​
We have developed strategic relationships with established companies in key areas including distribution, service, marketing, supply, technology development and product development. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on North America, Europe, and Asia, through our direct product sales force, OEMs, and their dealer networks. We operate in Europe under the name Plug Power Europe to sell electrolyzers to customers in the Europe, Middle East and African (EMEA) region and to sell hydrogen fuel cell systems for the European material handling market. 
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power LA JV, LLC, created a joint venture with Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Olin Corporation (“Olin”), named “Hidrogenii” in the third quarter of 2022. We believe Hidrogenii will support reliability of supply and speed to market for hydrogen throughout North America and set the foundation for broader collaboration between Plug and Olin. The construction of the 15-ton-per-day hydrogen production plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana progressed as planned in 2024 and is on schedule, as previously announced, for operations in the first quarter of 2025 once the final commissions phase is complete. Hidrogenii is owned 50% by Plug Power LA JV, LLC and 50% by Niloco Hydrogen Holdings LLC.
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, entered into a joint venture with Renault named HyVia in the second quarter of 2021. HyVia was formed to manufacture and sell fuel cell powered electric light commercial vehicles (“FCE-LCVs”) and to supply hydrogen fuel and fueling stations to support the FCE-LCV market, in each case primarily in Europe. HyVia is owned 50% by Plug Power France and 50% by Renault. In December 2024, HyVia entered receivership proceedings after facing challenges in the slow evolution of hydrogen mobility ecosystems in Europe. During 2024, the Company recorded losses for HyVia which resulted in the investments in non-consolidated entities and non-marketable equity securities financial statement line item of the consolidated balance sheets related to HyVia to be $0 as of December 31, 2024. For additional information see Note 4, “Investments”.
​
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power España S.L. (“Plug Power Spain”), entered into a joint venture with Acciona, named AccionaPlug S.L., in the fourth quarter of 2021. The joint venture intends to develop clean hydrogen

projects in Spain and Portugal and continues to evaluate potential projects. AccionaPlug S.L. has received funding and is owned 50% by Plug Power Spain and 50% by Acciona.
​
Plug Power Inc. entered into a joint venture with SK Innovation named SK Plug Hyverse Co. Ltd. (“SK Plug Hyverse”), which was initially funded in the first quarter of 2022. SK Plug Hyverse seeks to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in selected Asian markets. This collaboration aims to provide hydrogen fuel cell systems, fueling stations, electrolyzers and clean hydrogen to the Korean and other selected Asian markets. The partnership will leverage SK Innovation’s leadership in chemicals, petroleum and energy as well as Plug’s leading hydrogen platform. This joint venture is owned 49% by Plug Power Inc. and 51% by SK Innovation.
​
Plug Power Inc. has also invested in a hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity fund, Clean H2 Infra Fund, a special limited partnership registered in France, since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Clean H2 Infra Fund is focused on clean hydrogen infrastructure through financing projects in the production, storage and distribution of clean hydrogen. As of December 31, 2024 the Company’s ownership percentage in the Clean H2 Infra Fund was approximately 5%.
​
In addition, we believe Plug’s acquisitions over the last several years have allowed Plug to vertically integrate and uniquely position Plug in the hydrogen industry to offer end-to-end hydrogen solutions to global customers, complementing the Company’s industry-leading position in the design, construction, and operation of customer-facing hydrogen fueling stations and material handling fuel cell application. These acquisitions are expected to further establish a pathway for Plug to transition from low-carbon to zero-carbon hydrogen solutions.
​
Competition
​
We experience competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for motive and backup power are characterized by the presence of well-established battery and combustion generator products. We also face competition from companies that offer other carriers of energy, such as solar, wind and batteries, integrated gas companies, and companies offering products similar to ours, such as hydrogen generation via Steam Methane Reformers. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including size and weight, relative price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and reliability, safety, ease of use, footprint, rapid integration with existing equipment and processes, customer support design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation. For example:
​
●
Material handling
 – We face competition from technologies that require electrical infrastructure at distribution centers. These are largely lithium ion and lead-acid batteries. Our main differentiation from these technologies is that we offer increased productivity at our customer sites. For example, our technologies provide more sustained power than batteries, recharge more quickly and also do not require our customers’ distribution centers to draw significant power from a local electrical grid.
●
Stationary products
 – In backup and intermittent power applications, such as EV charging, we face competition from diesel generators provided by large corporations around the world. With respect to charging EVs, we fulfill a niche segment that allows customers to power vehicles while not being connected to the electrical grid. In continuous power applications, we provide a new alternative to distributed energy, such as natural gas turbines.
●
Hydrogen generation and storage
 – We face competition from companies offering products similar to ours. For example, we face competition from legacy industrial gas companies that also produce hydrogen, and there are other companies that produce PEM electrolyzers, liquefiers and cryogenic transportation and storage equipment. Our products are designed to be more efficient on operating costs and we offer vertically integrated end-to-end hydrogen solutions. For example, our hydrogen liquefaction system has one of the most energy-efficient designs in the market utilizing hydrogen as the refrigerant in the main liquefaction cycle, and our hydrogen tanker is one of the largest and lightest trailers currently being manufactured, with significant over-the-road payloads.
​
Intellectual Property 
​
We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems. However, we believe the design and integration of our system and system components, as well as some of the low-cost manufacturing processes that we have developed, are intellectual property that can be protected. Our intellectual property portfolio covers, among other things: fuel cell components that reduce manufacturing part count; fuel cell system designs that lend themselves to mass manufacturing; improvements to fuel cell system efficiency, reliability and system life; and control strategies, such as added safety protections and operation

under extreme conditions. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether patented or not, made or conceived while being our employee, which are related to or result from work or research that we perform, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
​
We have a total of 46 issued patents currently active with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), expiring between 2025 and 2042. At the close of 2024, we had 30 U.S. patent applications pending. Additionally, we have 18 trademarks registered with the USPTO due for renewal between 2025 and 2031, and 3 trademark applications pending.
​
Government Regulation

​
Our fuel cell, electrolyzer, and hydrogen products, their installations, and the operations at our facilities are subject to oversight and regulation at the international level, as well as federal, state, and local levels in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located — both domestically and abroad.
​
In addition, product safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), covering the overall fuel cell system. The class 1, 2, and 3 GenDrive products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of UL 2267 “Fuel Cell Power Systems for Installation in Industrial Electric Trucks” and NFPA 505 “Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks”. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems have been either certified to ANSI/CSA NGV2-2007 “Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Containers” or ISO/TS 15869 “Gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen blends—Land vehicle fuel tanks”. We will continue to design our GenDrive products to meet ANSI and/or other applicable standards. We certified several models of class 1, 2, and 3 GenDrive products to the requirements of the CE mark with guidance from a European certified body. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems are certified to the Pressure Equipment Directive by a European certified body. The GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of NFPA 2 “Hydrogen Technologies Code”. We are also subject to standards as applied to the design of our electrolyzer products, both domestically and abroad. Such standards include, but are not limited to, “Hydrogen Generators Using Water Electrolysis” (ISO 22734), “Hydrogen Technologies Code” (NFPA 2), “Explosive Atmospheres” requirements (UL 60079), CE product standards within the European Commission, and AS/NZS standards for our products within each jurisdiction, as applicable. As our Company increasingly expands to new markets and jurisdiction, we also become currently subject to new and different regulations in such jurisdictions.
​
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and non-U.S. environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, product safety, and emissions of pollution into the environment, and the remediation of contamination. Our facilities in the United States are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which regulates the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local residents. We are also subject to occupational safety regulations in other countries. In addition, certain environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can significantly increase the costs of our operations. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can subject us to additional costs and expenses, including defense costs and expenses and civil and criminal penalties. Environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future. Additionally, new environmental laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the uses of certain materials, chemicals, and/or components that are needed for our products and technologies. There can be no assurance that existing or future environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our business.
​
We will continue to evaluate the potential impact such laws and regulations will have on our business. In addition, existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords could have a material effect on our business or markets that we serve, or on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. There is no guarantee that any such legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords will be favorable to our business. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

​
At this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, may be imposed on our products or their installation. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install, and service our products. As we continue distributing our systems to our target markets, federal, state, local, or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts
.
​
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, for a description of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position.
​
Inflation, Material Availability and Labor Shortages 
​
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources; however, we believe there are some component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, particularly those suppliers and vendors that supply materials in very limited supply worldwide or supply commodities that have a high degree of volatility, whose loss to us or general unavailability could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. For example, although we believe the liquid hydrogen supply challenges of the past may have lessened in recent months, we may again experience similar challenges relating to the availability of hydrogen, including but not limited to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts as they have in the past, which could negatively impact the amount of hydrogen we are able to provide under certain of our hydrogen supply agreements and other customer agreements. Furthermore, global commodity pricing has been volatile and has been influenced by political events and worldwide economic trends, which has impacted our sourcing strategies, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and financial condition. We have mitigated and are continuing to mitigate these risks by continuing to diversify our supply chain, including diversifying our global supply chain and implementing alternate system architectures that we expect will allow us to source from multiple fuel cell, electrolyzer stack and air supply component vendors. While we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components, insourcing and localized manufacturing when feasible, we are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, product and sales forecasting, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. However, ongoing changes to, and evolution of, our products designs such as simultaneous design/build efforts and new product serviceability trends, or incorrect forecasting or updates to previously forecasted volumes could present challenges to those strategies despite best efforts in leveraging supplier relationships and capabilities. With respect to production, although cost pressures from global energy prices and inflation have been less volatile than previous years, an increase in cost pressures or a rise in inflation could negatively affect our business again, which could have a pricing impact on our key raw materials. We have a regionally diverse supply chain, and in cases where we have single sourced suppliers (typically due to new technology and products or worldwide shortages due to global demand), we work to engineer alternatives in our product design or develop new supply sources while covering short- and medium-term risks with supply contracts, building up inventory, and development partnerships. However, if we are unable to reduce such inventory, that could tie up working capital.
​
We continue to take proactive steps through our supply chain team to limit the impact of supplier challenges generally and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and transportation vendors to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we have continued discussions with suppliers with respect to the terms of our supply agreements, and the outcome of such discussions, including whether those discussions yield the desired modifications in the terms of such supply agreements, may impact the timing of when we receive shipments of certain supplies or result in other supply chain issues.
​
With respect to our service business, we have experienced inflationary increases in labor, parts and related overhead. This has contributed to the increase in our estimated projected costs to service fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, which resulted in an increase in the provision for loss contracts related to service. If these trends continue, we may have to record additional service loss provisions in the future. We anticipate bookings and revenue will be uneven in the near-term while we pursue sales opportunities.
​
Additionally, we, as well as our suppliers and vendors, have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Tight labor markets have resulted in longer times to fill open positions for us and our suppliers and vendors. Increased employee turnover, reassessment of employee responsibilities given current business needs, changes in the availability of our workers as well as labor shortages have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs which could

negatively affect our component or raw material purchasing abilities, and in turn, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
​
Backlog
​
The timing of delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of our product and installation revenues. Many factors can cause a lag between the time a customer signs a contract and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the lead time for the manufacturing and construction of hydrogen related products, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, cryogenic equipment and hydrogen infrastructure. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, including delays in their financing arrangements. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets our timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize. For our installations, revenue and cost of revenue can fluctuate significantly on a periodic basis depending on the timing of acceptance by the customer.
​
Research and Development 
​
Because the fuel cell industry is still in the early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of cost, size, weight, and in supporting service solutions in order to drive further commercialization.
​
We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Our research and development expense totaled $77.2 million, $113.7 million, and $99.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had 3,224 employees, of which 172 are temporary employees, with 2,771 located in the United States and 453 located outside of the United States. In February 2024, we announced a cost-reduction initiative that included strategic workforce adjustments which was effectively completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. We continually evaluate our workforce needs to meet the Company’s strategic priorities. In March 2025, we announced a cost-reduction initiative that included additional reductions in the workforce over the coming weeks. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is positive.
​
Engagement and Inclusion
​
The Company is dedicated to fostering a culture of employee engagement and inclusion and is committed to hiring talented and qualified individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives to which the Company’s ultimate success is linked.
​
We actively seek to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination and that fosters a sense of community and belonging among the workforce. We seek to provide everyone at Plug with equal opportunity to grow and develop, leveraging the unique skills and differences of their individual background, characteristics, and aspirations.
​
We appreciate the collective differences of our employees, and we value different perspectives to solve complex problems and bring innovative solutions. We are transparent and collaborative, welcoming ideas, thoughts, and questions from everyone. We endeavor to champion inclusivity, to respect each other, and to celebrate our differences as we build an environment in which we are all proud to be a part.
​
Community Involvement
​
We recognize the importance of supporting our local communities as we continue to grow as an organization. For example, we donate to our local communities, facilitate employee donations through United Way, and have initiated a 
14

Community Relations Program to evaluate deserving nonprofit organizations to boost our corporate giving program. Also, each Plug employee is provided sixteen (16) hours per year paid time off to volunteer with a not-for-profit organization of his or her choice.
​
Performance Management, Compensation and Benefits
​
Our performance management process incorporates annual goals for the Company, as well as departmental and individual employee goals. Employees and their managers are accountable for goals and must review performance against the goals on an ongoing basis. We provide employees base wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and location. Additionally, employees may also be granted annual short-term incentive compensation and equity compensation awards with multi-year vesting for retention.
​
As part of our commitment to our people, Plug offers employees competitive pay and benefits, including health, vision, and dental plans, flexible spending accounts, comprehensive life insurance (including company-provided life insurance), disability coverage and a 401(k) retirement program. Additionally, employees are offered a vacation and holiday package, and paid parental leave to aid in bonding time for new parents. To encourage savings, we auto-enroll all employees in our 401(k)-retirement savings plan after 30 days of employment.
​
Talent and Training
​
Our talent strategy is a balance of attracting external talent, combined with the possibility of upward mobility that encourages career growth and opportunity to progress within Plug. We leverage both internal and external recruitment resources and incentivize our current employees through our employee referral program to refer talent they recommend as future employees of Plug.
​
A key component to planning for individual career growth aligned with organizational growth is learning and development. For example, our educational assistance program offers financial assistance to encourage employees to continue their education and support their continuous enhancement of their knowledge and skills. Besides job-specific safety training, we offer personal development training on many topics, including sustainability and wellness. Online participation in internally developed business-related courses called Plugology is encouraged for all employees and helps newly hired employees assimilate to the business.

We strive to create a safe working environment, promoting environmental and employee health and safety awareness, and seek to undertake appropriate actions to reduce health and safety risks and establish procedures with appropriate protection for the safety of our employees. In addition, we undertake to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees by providing them with access to health and wellness programs that are designed to promote long-term healthy and active lifestyles. For example, in 2024 we launched a Global Employee Assistance Program to help with mental health, coaching and therapy services.
