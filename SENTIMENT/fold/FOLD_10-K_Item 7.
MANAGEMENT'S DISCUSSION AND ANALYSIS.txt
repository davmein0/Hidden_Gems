    We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct.

In light of these risks and uncertainties, we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A "— Risk Factors", a summary of which may be found below, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Those factors and the other risk factors described herein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future collaborations, alliances, business combinations, partnerships, strategic out-licensing of certain assets, the acquisition of preclinical-stage, clinical-stage, marketed products or platform technologies or other investments we may make. Consequently, there can be no assurance that actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation, and specifically decline any obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, even if experience or future developments make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law.

Summary Risk Factors
The following is a summary of the principal risks that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed descriptions included in Part I, Item 1A "— Risk Factors". This summary should be read together with those more detailed descriptions, along with our other SEC filings before making an investment decision.
•
We depend heavily on sales of Galafold
®
 and, increasingly, Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
. If we are delayed or unable to commercialize these products successfully, our business could be materially harmed.
•
If we are not able to obtain, or delayed in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our products or product candidates, materially impairing our ability to generate revenue.
•
If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities, or relationships, for our products or, if approved, product candidates, their commercialization may suffer.
•
If the market opportunities for our products or product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, then our revenues may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.
•
Galafold
®
, Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
, or any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance necessary for commercial success.
•
We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.
•
A variety of risks associated with international operations, including the U.S. and China relations, could adversely affect our business, particularly as it relates to products or product candidates for which we have a sole supplier.
•
Our products or any product candidates receiving approval may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives.
•
If we are found to have promoted off-label uses by regulatory authorities, we may become subject to significant liability.
•
Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.
•
If applicable regulatory authorities approve generic or biosimilar products with claims that compete with our products or any of our product candidates, it could reduce our sales.
•
We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product, product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on an alternative for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
•
Our products or product candidates may have side effects that could impact their regulatory approval or commercialization.
•
Any product or product candidate we obtain marketing approval for could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties or enforcement actions if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements.
•
Certain relationships will be subject to anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, anti-bribery and corruption and other laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal, civil, or contractual penalties, reputational harm and diminished earnings.
•
If clinical trials of our product candidates do not produce results satisfactory to regulatory authorities, the development and commercialization of our product candidates may not be completed.
•
If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of, or other unforeseen events in connection with, our clinical trials, potential regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.
•
If our competitors obtain orphan drug exclusivity for their products and we do not, we may be unable to have competing products approved in the applicable jurisdiction for a significant period of time.
•
Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval outside the U.S. would prevent us from marketing our products abroad.
•
Our gene therapy product candidates are based on novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of their development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.
•
Our use of third parties to manufacture our products or product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.
•
We may be unable to enter into agreements with third-party manufacturers, or unable to do so on acceptable terms. 
•
We rely on third parties to distribute our products who may not perform satisfactorily. 
•
We rely on third parties to conduct certain preclinical activities and our clinical trials, who may not perform satisfactorily.

•
Our business may be impacted by actions of the new U.S. administration, including executive orders, policies, new legislation, and judicial decisions.

Our business activities involve the use of hazardous materials which could subject us to significant adverse consequences if we fail to comply with the applicable laws regulating their use.
