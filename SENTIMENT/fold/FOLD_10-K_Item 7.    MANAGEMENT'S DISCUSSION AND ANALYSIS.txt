Net Product Sales. 
Net product sales increased $128.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to both the continued growth of Galafold

 in Europe and the U.S.
Cost of goods sold
. Cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our commercial products as well as royalties associated with net product sales of Galafold

 commercial launch, decreasing both clinical spend and the number of employees supporting research and development efforts.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense. 
Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $48.1 million, primarily driven by personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support our commercial launch activities, external costs required to support the manufacture and sale of our commercial products, and third-party professional fees.
Restructuring Charges. 
Restructuring charges were primarily related to an initiative to reduce operating costs by abandoning a lease that we no longer believe is useful in our operations. 
Loss on extinguishment of debt. 
In October 2023, the Company voluntarily prepaid the outstanding principal amount, accrued interest and prepayment premiums of the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026. As a result of this early extinguishment, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $13.9 million was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other (Expense) Income
. The $6.4 million variance was primarily related to the movement in foreign exchange rates caused by remeasurement of foreign-denominated balances.
Income Tax Expense. 
The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $27.4 million. We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are largely dependent on the mix of pre-tax earnings among the many jurisdictions in which we operate and differences in the timing of the recognition of such earnings under the relevant accounting standards and tax rules.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following discussion represents our critical accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
Our net product sales consist of sales of Galafold
®

for the treatment of Fabry disease and Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
® 
for the treatment of Pompe disease. We have recorded revenue on sales where our products are available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed early access program. Orders for our products

are generally received from distributors and pharmacies with the ultimate payor often a government authority.
We recognize revenue when our performance obligations with our customers have been satisfied, which occurs at a point in time when the pharmacies or distributors obtain control of our products. The transaction price is determined based on fixed consideration in our customer contracts net of estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration, which primarily consists of discounts and rebates due to foreign and U.S. government programs, is estimated based on contractual arrangements or statutory obligations, which may vary by product and payer and is recorded in the same period the related sales occur.

Estimation requires evaluation of our actual historical experience, customer mix, current contractual and statutory obligations, and inventory channel levels. We evaluate our customer mix to estimate which sales will be subject to which revenue dilutive items and consider changes to government program guidelines or contractual obligations that would impact the actual rebate or discount and/or our estimates of which sales qualify for such rebate or discount. We recognize revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in a future period. These estimates may differ from actual consideration received. We evaluate these estimates each reporting period to reflect known changes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As a result of our significant research and development expenditures, as well as expenditures to build a commercial organization to support the launch of Galafold
® 
and

Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
, we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in 2002. We have historically funded our operations through stock offerings, product revenues, debt issuance, collaborations, and other financing arrangements.
Sources of Liquidity
In November 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to create an at-the-market equity program ("ATM program"), pursuant to which we may offer to sell shares of our common stock having aggregate offering gross proceeds of up to $250.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,732,204 shares through our ATM program at a weighted-average public offering price of $11.69 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $19.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of $164.2 million worth of shares remain available to be issued and sold under the ATM program. 
In October 2023, we entered into the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of $387.4 million, after deducting fees and expenses. There were no warrants or equity conversion features associated with the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029. Simultaneously, we also entered into a securities purchase agreement with funds managed by Blackstone, for the private placement of an aggregate of 2,467,104 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $12.16 per share. Proceeds from the private placement, net of offering costs, were $29.8 million. We used proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 and the private placement to prepay the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026, inclusive of the outstanding principal amount, accrued interest and prepayment premium.

Cash Flow Discussion
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $249.9 million. We invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements in regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including obligations of U.S. government agencies and money market accounts. Wherever possible, we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk. Although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits, we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. For more details on the cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, refer to "— Note 4. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash," in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $33.9 million. The components of net cash used in operations included the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $56.1 million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $98.9 million partially offset by $84.9 million of stock compensation and $36.3 million of other non-cash adjustments. The change in operating assets was primarily due to an increase in inventory of $73.7 million to support our continued commercial growth, an increase in accounts receivable of $19.5 million, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $16.5 million associated with timing of payments, partially offset by an decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets by $14.0 million. 
Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $69.1 million. The components of net cash used in operations included the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $151.6 million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $48.0 million offset by $86.1 million of stock compensation and $44.4 million of other non-cash adjustments. The change in operating assets was primarily due to increases in inventory of $44.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $20.1 million associated with increased commercial sales, and an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $8.1 million primarily associated with tax prepayments. The net cash used in operations was also impacted by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $49.2 million, associated with accrued interest due to timing, inventory purchases to support our continued commercial growth, personnel costs, and an increase in sales rebates associated with increased commercial sales. 
Net Cash Used in (Provided by) Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.6 million. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, sales, and maturities of investments and capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities reflects $114.8 million for the purchase of marketable securities and $3.6 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $117.8 million for the sale and redemption of marketable securities.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $98.1 million. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, sales, and maturities of investments and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities reflects $197.2 million for the sale and redemption of marketable securities, partially offset by $91.7 million for the purchase of marketable securities and $7.4 million for capital expenditures.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $5.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects $19.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our ATM program and $7.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $22.0 million for payments of employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock unit vesting.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $61.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects $387.4 million of net proceeds from the Senior Secured Loan due in 2029, $63.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our ATM program, $29.8 million of net proceeds from our private placement with Blackstone, and $10.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the $408.0 million repayment of our Senior Secured Loan due in 2026, and $17.9 million for payments of employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock unit vesting.

We may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity. Based on our current operating model, we believe that the current cash position, which includes expected revenues, is sufficient to fund our operations and ongoing research programs for at least the next 12 months. Potential impacts of business development collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact our long-term capital requirements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, remaining maturities, including expected interest payments through maturity, on our Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 were $548.3 million. Refer to "— Note 11. Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
We are lessees to various operating leases for facilities and equipment. As of December 31, 2024, our undiscounted cash liabilities for operating leases were $81.0 million, with maturities ranging up through fiscal 2034. Refer to “— Note 12. Leases,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
In connection with our collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK"), pursuant to which we obtained global rights to develop and commercialize Galafold
®
 as a monotherapy and in combination with ERT for Fabry disease, GSK is eligible to receive post-approval and sales-based milestones up to $40 million, as well as tiered royalties in the mid-teens in eight major markets outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, remaining milestones under this agreement were $8.5 million. Refer to "— Note 14. Collaborative Agreements," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
We have a number of binding minimum purchase and manufacturing commitments due to our third-party manufacturers. As of December 31, 2024, these purchase and manufacturing obligations totaled $179.7 million, of which $102.7 million and $77.0 million are expected in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Contracts for which our commitment is variable, based on volumes, with no fixed minimum quantities, and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties have been excluded. These purchase obligations are in addition to amounts recorded on our December 31, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates, equity prices, creditworthiness, financing, exchange rates or other factors. Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We place our investments in high-quality financial instruments, primarily money market funds, asset backed securities, and U.S. government agency notes with maturities of less than one year, which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged, are classified as available-for-sale and, due to the short-term nature, are subject to minimal interest rate risk. We believe that a 1% (100 basis points) change in average interest rates would either increase or decrease the market value of our investment portfolio by $0.4 million as of December 31, 2024. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure and consistent with our investment policy, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. 
We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt. At December 31, 2024, we had a $400 million Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 that bears interest at a rate equal to the 3-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), subject to a 2.5% floor, plus a Term SOFR adjustment of 0.26161% and a margin of 6.25% per year. We entered into this loan in October of 2023, and simultaneously used proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 and the private placement to prepay the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026. We do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt. The annual average variable interest rate for our variable rate debts during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 11.7%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the average interest rate on our variable rate debts would result in $4.1 million change in the interest expense as of December 31, 2024. 
-78-
Table of Contents
We face foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily in British pounds ("GBP"). We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and net product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates may be partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. Based on our foreign currency denominated exposures as of December 31, 2024, we believe that a near-term 10% fluctuation of the USD to GBP exchange rate could result in a potential change in the fair value of our net GBP denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $57.4 million.

Item 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Management's Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. has prepared, and is responsible for the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company's board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Amicus therapeutics, Inc. are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Amicus therapeutics, Inc.; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) ("COSO") in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report. This report appears on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue recognition – Measurement of variable consideration
for Ex-U.S. third-party discounts and rebates
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue net of estimates for variable consideration, which are primarily third-party discounts and rebates. The sales discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue from the sale of the Company’s products is recognized, which occurs at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the product.
Auditing the Ex-U.S. sales discounts and rebates was complex because of the volume of sales discounts and rebates and the different contractual product price, discount and/or rebate rate for each country.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We identified, evaluated, and tested controls over management’s calculations of the discounts and rebates as well as the data input utilized in the calculations.

To test the revenue adjustments related to sales discounts and rebates our procedures included, among others, assessing the terms of the arrangement, evaluating the methodology used, testing the significant inputs, and the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used by management in its calculations. We inspected significant sales contracts and agreements that include the contractual rights to discounts and rebates and tested credit memos issued during the year and subsequent to year end. In addition, we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s calculations against actual results.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
Description of Business
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (the "Company") is a global, patient-dedicated biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and delivering novel medicines for rare diseases. The Company seeks to deliver the highest quality therapies that have the potential to obsolete current treatments, provide significant benefits to patients, and be first- or best-in-class. The Company's two marketed therapies are Galafold
®
, the first oral monotherapy for people living with Fabry disease who have amenable genetic variants, and Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
,

a novel two-component treatment for adults living with late-onset Pompe disease.
Galafold
®
 (also referred to as "migalastat"), is approved in over 40 countries around the world, including the United States ("U.S."), European Union ("E.U."), United Kingdom ("U.K."), and Japan. Additionally, Galafold
®
 has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S., E.U., U.K., Japan and several other countries. 
Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
 (also referred to as "cipaglucosidase alfa-atga/miglustat"), is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., and Switzerland. Multiple regulatory submissions and reimbursement processes with global health authorities are currently underway. Additionally, Pombiliti® + Opfolda® has been granted orphan drug designation or status in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan and data exclusivity in the E.U.
The Company had an accumulated deficit of $
2.7
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and anticipates incurring losses into the second half of 2025. The Company has historically funded its operations through stock offerings, product revenues, debt issuances, collaborations, and other financing arrangements.
Based on its current operating model, the Company believes the current cash position, which includes expected revenues, is sufficient to fund the Company's operations and ongoing research programs for at least the next 12 months. Potential business development opportunities, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact the Company's long-term capital requirements.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company has prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company's financial position for the periods presented. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results of operations, net assets or cash flows.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The functional currency for most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. For non-U.S. subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the weighted average foreign exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the Company's foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transactions which are not in the functional currency of the entity are remeasured into the functional currency with gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement recorded in other (expense) income.

Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of fixed income investments with a maturity of greater than three months and other highly liquid investments that can be readily purchased or sold using established markets. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reported within other comprehensive gain (loss) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Fair value is based on available market information including quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or other observable inputs.
Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the requirements of certain agreements that are restricted in their use and is included as a component of other non-current assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts, which, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company invests its marketable securities in high-quality commercial financial instruments. The Company has not recognized any losses from credit risks on such accounts during any of the periods presented. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities.
The Company is subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable primarily related to its product sales of Galafold
®
. The Company's accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 have arisen from product sales primarily in Europe, the U.S., and Japan. The Company will periodically assess the financial strength of its customers to establish allowances for anticipated losses, if any. For accounts receivable that have arisen from named patient sales, the payment terms are predetermined, and the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each customer on a regular basis.
 As of December 31, 2024, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was $
3.0
 million.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from 
three
 to 
five years
, or the lesser of the related initial term of the lease or useful life for leasehold improvements.
The initial cost of property and equipment consists of its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditures incurred after the fixed assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major replacements, improvements, and additions are capitalized in accordance with Company policy.
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If indications of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are compared to the carrying value of the asset to determine whether the asset or asset group's value is recoverable. If impairment is determined, the Company writes down the asset to its estimated fair value and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value in the period at which such a determination is made.

Revenue Recognition
 The Company has recorded revenue on sales where its products are available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed early access program. Product orders are generally received from distributors and pharmacies, with the ultimate payor often a government authority. In 2024, one customer accounted for 
26
% of net product sales and 
18
% of accounts receivable from product sales while another customer accounted for 
13
% of accounts receivable from product sales. In 2023, one customer accounted for 
28
% of net product sales and 
16
% of accounts receivable from product sales while another customer accounted for 
17
% of accounts receivable from product sales. Revenue attributed to U.K. and Germany each accounted for 
13
% of net product sales in 2024, 
10
% and 
13
% respectively in 2023, and 
12
% each in 2022.  
The Company recognizes revenue when its performance obligations to its customers have been satisfied, which occurs at a point in time when the pharmacies or distributors obtain control of the products. The transaction price is determined based on fixed consideration in the Company's customer contracts and is recorded net of estimates for variable consideration, which primarily consist of third-party discounts and rebates. The identified variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue from the sale is recognized. The Company recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in a future period. These estimates may differ from actual consideration received. The Company evaluates these estimates each reporting period to reflect known changes.
The following table summarizes the Company's net product sales disaggregated by product and geographic area:

, the Company expensed all manufacturing costs as research and development expense. Upon regulatory approval, the Company began capitalizing costs related to the purchase and manufacture of Pombiliti
®
 + Opfolda
®
.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are reviewed periodically to identify slow-moving or obsolete inventory based on projected sales activity as well as product shelf-life. In evaluating the recoverability of inventories produced, the probability that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory is considered and inventory value is written down for inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements. Expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are recognized as cost of goods sold in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory sold, manufacturing and supply chain costs, product shipping and handling costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, as well as royalties payable. A portion of inventory available for sale was expensed as research and development costs prior to regulatory approval and, as such, the cost of goods sold and related gross margins are not necessarily indicative of future costs of goods sold and gross margin.

Fair Value Measurements
The Company records certain asset and liability balances under the fair value measurements as defined by the Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") guidance. Current FASB fair value guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, current FASB guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions that market participant's assumptions would use in pricing assets or liabilities (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense consist primarily of costs related to personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees, and the cost of facilities and support services used in drug development. Assets acquired that are used for research and development and have no future alternative use are expensed as in-process research and development.
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income consists of interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Interest expense consists of interest incurred on debt and finance leases.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by U.S. Federal, state, and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained.
Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss)
Components of other comprehensive gain (loss) include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.

Leases
The Company primarily enters into lease agreements for office space, equipment, and vehicles. The leases have varying terms, some of which could include options to renew, extend, and early terminate. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
ROU assets represent the Company's right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same line item as expenses arising from fixed lease payments for operating leases. The Company has lease agreements that include lease and non-lease components, which the Company accounts for as a single lease component for all underlying asset categories. 
The lease term for all of the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. 
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company applies this policy to all underlying asset categories.
Nonqualified Cash Deferral Plan
The Company's Cash Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan") provides certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors as selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee"), with an opportunity to defer the receipt of such participant's base salary, bonus, and director's fees, as applicable. The Deferral Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that complies with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. All of the investments held in the Deferral Plan are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value with changes in the investments' fair value recognized as earnings in the period they occur. The corresponding liability for the Deferral Plan is included in other non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Equity-based Compensation
At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 equity-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in "— Note 8. Stockholders' Equity." The Company applies the fair value method of measuring equity-based compensation, which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Loss per Common Share
The Company calculates net loss per share as a measurement of the Company's performance while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period. The Company had a net loss for all periods presented; accordingly, the inclusion of common stock options and unvested restricted stock units would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.

Segment Information
The Company currently operates in 
one
 business segment focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of advanced therapies to treat a range of devastating rare and orphan diseases. The Company is not organized by market and is managed and operated as 
one
 business. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), its Chief Executive Officer, who comprehensively manages the entire business. The Company and its CODM evaluate performance and allocate resources primarily based on Net product sales and Net loss within the Consolidated Statement of Operations he is regularly provided. Net loss is used to monitor budget to actual results and actuals against prior periods. The Company does not accumulate discrete financial information with respect to separate service lines, and thus there is 
one
 reportable segment. The Company does not operate any separate lines of business or separate business entities with respect to its products. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets provide information regarding significant segment expenses and segment assets. Revenue segregation by product line is presented in the revenue recognition section earlier in this footnote.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Company records goodwill in a business combination when the total consideration exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment on October 1 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative test is necessary. If required, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is concluded. If it is determined the Company's single reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. 
Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and, if applicable, impairment charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is recorded over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is determined, the Company writes down the asset to its estimated fair value and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value in the period at which such a determination is made.
No indicators of impairment were noted during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2024
In November 2023, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments expand reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require, among other things, disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and require that public entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required unless it is impracticable, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2024. 
Recent Accounting Developments -  Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 The ASU requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, must be applied prospectively with an option to apply retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses." The standard is intended to require more detailed disclosures about specified categories of expenses (including employee compensation, depreciation, and

amortization) included in certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Finite-lived Intangible Assets
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had intangible assets of $
17.2
 million. Intangible assets consist of lead enzyme replacement therapy assets acquired with the Callidus Biopharma, Inc. ("Callidus") acquisition in 2013, previously accounted for as in-process research and development. In March 2023, as a result of the European Commission's ("EC") approval of Pombiliti
®
, the Company began amortizing the assets over the initial regulatory exclusivity period of 
7
 years. The Company completed an impairment assessment before changing the classification to finite-lived intangible asset noting no impairment. Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $
3.3
 million and $
2.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Total estimated amortization expense for the finite-lived intangible assets for each of the next 5 years is approximately $
3.3
 million and has a remaining amortization period of 
5.2
 years.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Callidus in 2013 and Scioderm, Inc. in 2015, the Company had goodwill of $
197.8
 million. There has been no change to the balance of goodwill since the dates of acquisition.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2024, the Company held $
213.8
 million in cash and cash equivalents and $
36.2
 million of marketable securities which are reported at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses are generally reported within other comprehensive gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below the Company's cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary or if an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is determined to be less than the amortized cost and the Company intends or is more than likely to sell the security before recovery and it is not considered a credit loss, such security is written down to its estimated fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an impairment charge. If the unrealized loss of an available-for-sale debt security is determined to be a result of credit loss the Company would recognize an allowance and the corresponding credit loss would be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company regularly invests excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions, money market funds, notes issued by the U.S. government, as well as fixed income investments and U.S. bond funds, both of which can be readily purchased and sold using established markets. The Company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of these financial instruments is mitigated as, in accordance with Company policy, securities are of high credit rating. Investments that have original maturities greater than three months but less than one year are classified as current. All marketable securities represent the investment of funds available for current operations, notwithstanding their contractual maturities. 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are classified as current unless mentioned otherwise below and consisted of the following:

Stockholders' Equity
Common Stock and Warrants
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was authorized to issue 
500
 million shares of common stock. Dividends on common stock will be paid when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors. Each holder of common stock is entitled to vote on all matters that are appropriate for stockholder voting and is entitled to 
one
 vote for each share held.
In November 2022, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to create an at-the-market equity program ("ATM program"), pursuant to which the Company may offer to sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering gross proceeds of up to $
250.0
 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 
1,732,204
 shares through its ATM program at a weighted-average public offering price of $
11.69
 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $
19.6
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 
5,244,936
 shares through its ATM program at a weighted-average public offering price of $
12.50
 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $
63.1
 million. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of $
164.2

Nonqualified Cash Deferral Plan
The Company's Deferral Plan provides certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors, as selected by the Compensation Committee, with an opportunity to defer the receipt of such participant's base salary, bonus, and director's fees, as applicable. The Deferral Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that complies with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended.
The Company had a deferred compensation investment balance of $
2.2
 million and $
7.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with corresponding approximate amounts of liability. 
Deferral Plan investment assets are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value with changes in the investments' fair value recognized as earnings in the period they occur. Deferred compensation liability amounts under the Deferral Plan are included in other long-term liabilities.

Equity Incentive Plan 
The Company's Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") provides for the granting of restricted stock units and options to purchase common stock in the Company to employees, directors, advisors, and consultants at a price to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors. The Plan is intended to encourage ownership of stock by employees and consultants of the Company and to provide additional incentives for them to promote the success of the Company's business. Under the provisions of the Plan, no option will have a term in excess of 
10
 years. The Board of Directors, or its committee, is responsible for determining the individuals to be granted options, the number of options each individual will receive, the option price per share, and the exercise period of each option. Options granted pursuant to the Plan generally vest 
25
% on the first year anniversary date of grant plus an additional 1/48th for each month thereafter and may be exercised in whole or in part for 
100
% of the shares vested at any time after the date of grant. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has reserved up to 
14,228,754
 shares for issuance under the Plan.

Stock-based Compensation 
The Plan provides for the granting of restricted stock units and options to purchase common stock in the Company to employees, directors, advisors, and consultants at a price to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Plan is intended to encourage ownership of stock by employees and consultants of the Company and to provide additional incentives for them to promote the success of the Company’s business. The Board of Directors, or its committee, is responsible for determining the individuals to be granted options, the number of options each individual will receive, the option price per share, and the exercise period of each option.
The Plan provides for certain benefits to qualifying Plan participants who separate from service with the Company due to death, disability or "retirement" (as such term is defined under the Plan) ("Qualified Participants"). Options granted under the Plan to a Qualified Participant shall continue to vest until the 
2
nd anniversary of the Qualified Participant’s separation and all vested options held by such Qualified Participant shall remain exercisable until the earlier of the 
4
th anniversary of the Qualified Participant’s separation or the original expiration date of the option. Options that are not exercised during this exercise period shall be forfeited. Time-based restricted stock units and restricted stock granted to a Qualified Participant under the Plan that was scheduled to vest within the 
two-year
 period following the Qualified Participant's separation shall accelerate and be delivered upon such separation. Any time-based restricted stock units or restricted stock that would have vested after such 
two-year
 period will be forfeited upon the Qualified Participant's separation. Also, per the Amendment, any performance-based restricted stock units under the Plan ("PRSUs") received by the Qualified Participant, shall remain eligible to vest after the Qualified Participant’s separation based on the actual performance of the Company through the end of the performance period applicable to any such PRSUs.
Stock Option Grants
The Company uses the fair value method of measuring share-based compensation, using the fair value of each equity award granted. The Company chose the ‘‘straight-line’’ attribution method for allocating compensation costs and recognized the fair value of each stock option on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related awards. 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model when estimating the grant date fair value for share-based awards. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the look-back period corresponding to the expected life of the options. The average expected life is determined using the Company's actual historical data. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury, zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (collectively "RSUs")
RSUs awarded under the Plan are generally subject to graded vesting and are contingent on an employee's continued service. RSUs are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of vesting restrictions. The Company expenses the cost of the RSUs, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse.

The Company's Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 falls into the Level 2 category within the fair value level hierarchy and the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that factors in current market yields for comparable borrowing arrangements under the Company's credit profile. The carrying value of the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 approximates the fair value. Deferred compensation plan liability is recorded as a component of other non-current liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Cash, Money Market Funds and Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its cash and cash equivalents within the fair value hierarchy as Level 1 as these assets are valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets at the measurement date. The Company considers its investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale and classifies these assets within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 primarily utilizing broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024. No transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024.

2.5
% floor, plus a Term SOFR adjustment of 
0.26161

twelve
 quarterly payments of $
33.3
 million, starting on January 2027 with the final balance due on the maturity date in October 2029. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of $

Any prepayment of the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 is subject to certain make-whole premiums and prepayment premiums, the latter of which decrease until the fifth anniversary of the transaction date at which point no prepayment penalty shall exist. The obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 are secured by a first lien security interest in certain assets of the Company. The Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to the Company. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, Blackstone may declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029 to be immediately due and payable.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). The Tax Act significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 21%, imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions. The Tax Act also introduced an additional U.S. tax on certain non-U.S. subsidiaries’ earnings which are considered to be Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (referred to as "GILTI"). After consideration of the relevant guidance and completing the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act, the Company has elected to treat GILTI as a period cost. 
Beginning in 2022, the Tax Act eliminated the right to deduct research and development expenditures for tax purposes in the period the expenses were incurred and instead requires all U.S. and foreign research and development expenditures to be amortized over five and fifteen tax years, respectively.

The Company records a valuation allowance for temporary differences for which it is more likely than not that the Company will not receive future tax benefits. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $
609.1
 million and $
649.3
 million, respectively, representing a decrease in the valuation allowance of $
40.2
 million in 2024, due to the uncertainty regarding the realization of such deferred tax assets, to offset the benefits of net operating losses generated during those years. The deferred tax liability related to business acquisitions pertains to the basis difference in intangible assets acquired by the Company. The Company's policy is to record a deferred tax liability related to acquired intangible assets that may eventually be realized either upon amortization of the asset when the research is completed, and a product is successfully launched or the write-off of the asset if it is abandoned or unsuccessful.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carry forwards ("NOLs") of approximately $
1.1
 billion and $
1.0
 billion, respectively. The federal carry forward for losses generated prior to 2018 will expire in 2031 through 2037. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and onward have an indefinite expiration under the Tax Act. Most of the state net operating loss carry forwards generated prior to 2009 have expired through 2016. The remaining state net operating loss carry forwards including those generated in 2009 through 2024 will expire in 2028 through 2042. State research and development credits will expire 2024 through 2033. Utilization of NOLs may be subject to a substantial limitation pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 382"), as well as similar state statutes in the event of an ownership change. Such ownership changes have occurred in the past and could occur again in the future. Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. The Company may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in the stock ownership some of which are outside the Company's control. The Company completed a detailed study of the NOLs for the tax year 2024 and determined that there was not an ownership change in excess of 50%. Ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on the Company's ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently decrease the amount of state attributes and increase state taxes owed. 
The Company also has U.S. federal research and experimentation and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately $
19.1
 million and $
201.6
 million, respectively, which will expire in the years 2030 through 2043. The Company also has state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
13.5
 million. Deferred tax assets for these carryforwards are subject to a full valuation allowance.
The Company permanently reinvests the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except for its U.K. operations. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized of the deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 
The Organization Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Pillar 2 rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Numerous countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as January 1, 2024, with general implementation of a global minimum tax by January 1, 2025. The Company does not expect this new rule to apply until the Company meets the minimum global revenue threshold.

Collaborative Agreements
GlaxoSmithKline
In July 2012, as amended in November 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK"), pursuant to which Amicus obtained global rights to develop and commercialize Galafold
®
 as a monotherapy and in combination with ERT for Fabry disease (“Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, GSK is eligible to receive post-approval and sales-based milestones up to $
40
 million, as well as tiered royalties in the mid-teens in 
eight
 major markets outside the U.S. 
As of December 31, 2024, the contingent milestone payments due to GSK were $
4.7
 million and are recorded within the other current and other non-current liabilities accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sales based tiered royalties due to GSK are recorded within the cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, under the GSK collaboration agreement, the Company incurred approximately $
32.7
 million of royalty expenses, of which $
9.8
 million is recorded within accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Legal Proceedings
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva"), Aurobindo Pharma Limited ("Aurobindo"), and Lupin Limited ("Lupin") in connection with Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDA”) filed with the FDA requesting approval to market generic Galafold®. In November 2022, the Company filed 
four
 lawsuits against Teva, Lupin, and Aurobindo in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Court") for infringement of its Orange Book-listed patents. In the fourth quarter of 2023, a stipulation order to stay litigation with respect to Lupin was ordered. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, a stipulation was filed with the court and approved by the presiding judge, whereby the parties agreed to accept the Company’s definition of the terms that were in dispute. As such, the scheduled Markman hearing was deemed unneeded and cancelled. 
In October 2024, the Company entered into a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license with Teva which will allow Teva to market its generic version of Galafold
®
 in the United States beginning on January 30, 2037, or earlier in certain circumstances. In accordance with the license agreement, a consent judgment and permanent injunction was entered with the Court and all Hatch-Waxman litigation between Amicus and Teva has been terminated. As required by law, Amicus and Teva have submitted the confidential license agreement to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice for review. 
The litigation will continue against Aurobindo as the remaining active party, and the litigation stay remains in place for Lupin. The Company has, and will continue to, vigorously enforce its Galafold
®
 intellectual property rights.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
