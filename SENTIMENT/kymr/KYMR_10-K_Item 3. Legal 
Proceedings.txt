Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to reinventing the treatment of human disease through the development of innovative, highly differentiated medicines that address significant health problems and that meaningfully improve patients’ lives. We are committed to advancing novel technologies to address targets that have known disease-causing biology, but which have not been drugged, or have been inadequately drugged, often based on limitations of existing technologies. Our approach is intended to discover and develop a new generation of medicines in a disease-agnostic manner.

We are a leader in targeted protein degradation, or TPD, a next-generation small molecule therapeutic modality that engages the body’s natural cellular recycling system to selectively eliminate disease-causing proteins. Our objective is to develop molecules that are both potent and highly selective, creating the potential for our medicines to uniquely address diseases that are poorly served by current treatment options. To date, we have progressed five programs into clinical development and expect to advance at least one new molecular entity into clinical testing annually. We intend to leverage our drug development expertise to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with an industry-leading pipeline of novel medicines.

Our current focus is primarily directed at high-value targets in immunology. We believe there are more than 160 million patients in the United States, Europe and Japan that are diagnosed with some of the most prevalent immune-inflammatory diseases that our programs are designed to address, nearly half of whom remain untreated. Of those treated, most patients are treated with therapies that do not treat the underlying diseases but mostly their symptoms. As a result, only a small percentage of patients, which we believe to be approximately 3% of the diagnosed population with severe inflammatory diseases, are currently treated with systemic advanced therapies, mostly injectable biologics. While generally efficacious, biologics have drawbacks. Biologics tend to be more expensive to manufacture, and the cost is typically passed on to patients and payors. Patient access to therapy can also be a challenge, as biologics are more complex to prescribe and reimburse than small molecule medicines. Additionally, biologics are administered as injections, a less preferred route of administration for patients as compared to oral medications, which offer greater flexibility for patients. We believe we have the potential to deliver a compelling value proposition to a significant underserved patient population: small molecule medicines with biologics-like activity through the convenience of oral administration of a pill.

Our publicly disclosed immunology programs target STAT6, TYK2 and IRAK4, each of which addresses targets within validated pathways, providing the opportunity to treat a broad range of diseases. We are developing KT-621 as part of our STAT6 program, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Our lead molecule in our TYK2 program is KT-295, which we anticipate will enter the clinic in the second quarter of 2025. We are collaborating with Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, on the development of drug candidates targeting IRAK4, including KT-474/SAR444656, outside of oncology and immuno-oncology fields. Sanofi has initiated two Phase 2b clinical trials of KT-474 in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Our pipeline focuses on addressing high impact targets that have been elusive to conventional modalities and that drive the pathogenesis of multiple serious diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

In addition to our immunology focus, we also have research initiatives in other therapeutic areas. Additionally, we believe many of our key discovery and development capabilities have broad applicability, creating an opportunity for us to develop impactful therapeutics leveraging small-molecule modalities in addition to TPD.

Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, research and development activities, business planning, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have received gross proceeds of $1.71 billion from sales of our convertible preferred stock, the sale of common stock including our August 2020 initial public offering, or IPO, and concurrent private placement, our subsequent follow-on offerings and private placement offering, our prior sales agreement with Cowen and through our corporate collaborations.

84

We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. Our net losses were $223.9 million, $147.0 million and $154.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $754.6 million and $530.8 million, respectively. We expect that our expense and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:

•
initiate and complete preclinical studies and clinical trials for current or future product candidates;

•
prepare and submit Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, with the U.S Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for future product candidates;

•
develop and scale up our capabilities to support our ongoing preclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;

•
secure facilities to support continued growth in our research, development and commercialization efforts;

•
advance research and development related activities to expand our product pipeline;

•
expand and improve the capabilities of our drug discovery platform;

•
seek regulatory approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;

•
contract to manufacture our product candidates;

•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

•
hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific and management personnel; and 

•
incur additional costs associated with continuing to operate as a public company.   

In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our lead product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates. The lengthy process of securing marketing approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product candidate development efforts and our business overall. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $850.9 million. We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid 2027, which will enable us to execute on multiple data readouts across our programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Liquidity and capital resources” below.

Components of Our Results of Operations

Revenue

To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Our only revenues have been derived from research collaboration arrangements with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, and Sanofi. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be

85

derived primarily from our current collaboration agreements and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. To date, we have not received any royalties under any of the collaboration agreements.

Vertex Collaboration Agreement

On May 9, 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Vertex Agreement, with Vertex, to advance small molecule protein degradation against up to six targets. Under the Vertex Agreement, Vertex was granted the exclusive option to license the rights to the product candidates developed through the collaboration at which point Vertex would control development and commercialization. Pursuant to the Vertex Agreement, we were responsible for discovery and preclinical research on the targets, and Vertex was responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the product candidates after it exercises its option to license. Vertex provided us with a non-refundable upfront payment of $50.0 million and purchased 3,059,695 shares of our Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock at $6.54 a share, pursuant to a separate, but simultaneously executed Share Purchase Agreement.

The Vertex Agreement expired upon the completion of the initial research term on May 9, 2023
.

Sanofi Agreement

On July 7, 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Sanofi Agreement, with Sanofi to co-develop drug candidates directed to two biological targets. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we granted to Sanofi a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain lead compounds generated during the collaboration directed against IRAK4 and one additional undisclosed target in an undisclosed field of use. Such license is exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis only after a specified milestone. For compounds directed against IRAK4, the field of use includes diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation or prevention of any diseases, disorders or conditions, excluding oncology and immuno-oncology. We are responsible for discovery and preclinical research and conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for at least one degrader directed against IRAK4 plus up to three backup degraders. With respect to both targets, Sanofi is responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of product candidates after a specified development milestone occurs with respect to each collaboration candidate.

We have an exclusive option, or Opt-In Right, exercisable on a collaboration-target-by-collaboration-target basis that will include the right to (i) to fund 50% of the United States development costs for collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use and (ii) share equally in the net profits and net losses of commercializing collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use in the United States. In addition, if we exercise the Opt-In Right, Sanofi will grant us an exclusive option, applicable to each collaboration target, which upon exercise will allow us to conduct certain co-promotion activities in the field in the United States.

The Sanofi Agreement, unless earlier terminated, will expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of expiration of all payment obligations under the Sanofi Agreement with respect to such product. We or Sanofi may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or insolvency or for certain patent challenges. In addition, Sanofi may terminate the agreement for convenience or for a material safety event upon advance prior written notice, and we may terminate the agreement with respect to any collaboration candidate if, following Sanofi’s assumption of responsibility for the development, commercialization or manufacturing of collaboration candidates with respect to a particular target, Sanofi ceases to exploit any collaboration candidates directed to such target for a specified period.

In consideration for the exclusive licenses granted to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi paid to us an upfront payment of $150.0 million. In addition to the upfront payment, under the agreement we were eligible to receive certain development milestone payments of up to $1.48 billion, and commercial milestone payments of up to $700.0 million, in the aggregate. Of these milestones, we remain eligible to receive up to $1.0 billion in development milestones upon the achievement of certain developmental or regulatory events, and up to $400.0 million in commercial milestones which are payable upon the achievement of certain net sales thresholds, all of which are related to the IRAK4 program. We will further be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to high teens, subject to low-single digits upward adjustments in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2024, we have achieved $55.0 million of milestones under the Sanofi Agreement related to certain IRAK4 clinical milestones.

On November 15, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement with Sanofi, or the Amended Sanofi Agreement, which amended the Original Sanofi Agreement to revise certain research terms and responsibilities set forth under the Original Sanofi Agreement. The Amended Sanofi Agreement also specifies details around the timing and number of Phase 2 trials required under the terms of the collaboration. The Amended Sanofi Agreement became effective on December 5, 2022.

86

Additionally with respect to Sanofi, on December 2, 2022, Sanofi provided the Company with written notice of its intention to advance the collaboration target 1 candidate, KT-474, into Phase 2 clinical trials for which the Company received milestone payments as further set forth in the Amended Sanofi Agreement. Phase 2 clinical trials of KT-474 are initially investigating its potential in HS and AD with the clinical trial for both indications having been initiated and commenced dosing in 2023.

In September 2023, the Company and Sanofi mutually agreed to cease activities related to Collaboration Target 2.

Operating expenses

Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of targeted protein degradation therapeutics. These research efforts and costs include external research costs, personnel costs, supplies, license fees and facility-related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:

•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

•
costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct clinical trials and preclinical activities on our behalf;

•
contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that are primarily engaged to provide drug substance and product for our preclinical research and development programs, nonclinical studies, clinical trials and other scientific development services; 

•
the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical and nonclinical trial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches; 

•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; 

•
costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and 

•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements. 

Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of any future product candidates.

Our future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:

•
per patient trial costs; 

•
the number of trials required for approval; 

•
the number of sites included in the trials; 

•
the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

•
the number of patients that participate in the trials; 

•
the number of doses that patients receive; 

87

•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 

•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates; 

•
the phase of development of our product candidates; and 

•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. 

The successful development and commercialization of product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:

•
the timing and progress of nonclinical and clinical development activities; 

•
the number and scope of nonclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

•
the ability to raise necessary additional funds; 

•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements; 

•
our ability to maintain our current development programs and to establish new ones; 

•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; 

•
the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; 

•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

•
the availability of drug substance and drug product for use in production of our product candidates; 

•
our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates are approved; 

•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; 

•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

•
our ability to obtain and maintain third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

•
the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 

•
the impact of competition with other products; 

•
the impact of any business interruptions to our operations, including the timing and enrollment of patients in our planned clinical trials, or to those of our manufacturers, suppliers, or other vendors resulting from a future pandemic or similar public health crisis; and

•
our ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety profile for our therapies following approval. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

88

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, corporate and business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services, insurance costs, facilities costs, administrative travel expenses, marketing expenses and other operating costs.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support development of our product candidates and our continued research activities. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as legal, investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest and other income and expense, net

Interest and other income and expense consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances and interest expense related to our financing leases.

Collaboration revenue

We recognize revenue under each of our collaboration agreements based on our pattern of performance related to the respective identified performance obligation, which is the period over which we will perform research services under each of the respective agreements.

Collaboration revenues were $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, the entirety of which was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Sanofi. Collaboration revenues were $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $8.4 million and $70.2 million were attributable to our collaboration agreements with Vertex and Sanofi, respectively. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to the achievement of $55 million in milestones under the Sanofi agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the associated cumulative catch-up of revenue at that time.

Research and development expenses were $240.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $51.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $58.4 million in costs related to our STAT6, TYK2 and MDM2 programs, as well as an increase of $21.1 million in personnel, stock-based compensation and occupancy costs due to increases in employee headcount in our research and development functions. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million reduction in activities related to our IRAK4 and STAT3 programs and a $17.4 million reduction in our other research and development costs due to stage progression and breakout of STAT6 and TYK2 programs.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $8.5 million increase was primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in personnel, stock-based compensation and occupancy costs due to increases in employee headcount in the general and administrative functions, and a $1.5 million increase in legal and professional services expenses to support our operations as a public company.

Impairment of long-lived assets

Impairment of long-lived assets was $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0 for year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $4.9 million was as a result of the occupancy of the 2021 Lease facility in February of 2024 and the corresponding exit of the 2019 Lease facility, resulting in an impairment charge of $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2024.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net was $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $19.2 million increase was primarily due to the increase in our investments balance as a result of 2024 financing activities as well as prevailing interest rates in the respective periods.

Other income, net was $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $12.2 million increase was primarily due to the prevailing interest rates in the respective periods.

Liquidity and capital resources

We have not yet generated any revenue from any product sales, and we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. To date, we have received gross proceeds of $1.71 billion from sales of our convertible preferred stock, the sale of common stock including our August 2020 initial public offering, or IPO, and concurrent private placement, our follow-on offerings and private placement offering, our prior sales agreement with Cowen, and through our corporate collaborations. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $850.9 million.

In October 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, or Cowen Sales Agreement, with Cowen, pursuant to which we were able to offer and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $250.0 million from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings through Cowen, as our sales agent. We agreed to pay Cowen a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares sold by Cowen under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold 1,519,453 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $50 million. On October 30, 2024, Cowen acknowledged and accepted our prior written notice to terminate the Cowen Sales Agreement, which termination was effective on October 30, 2024. As a result of such termination, we will not offer or sell any additional shares of common stock under the Cowen Sales Agreement.

On October 31, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement
SM
, or Jefferies Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $300.0 million from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings through Jefferies, as our sales agent. We agreed to pay Jefferies a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares sold by Jefferies under the Jefferies Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the Jefferies Sales Agreement.

Cash Flow used in Operating Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $194.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $223.9 million during the period and a $41.1 million decrease in deferred revenue under our collaboration agreements. These were partially offset by a $17.2 million net decrease in other operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, operating lease liabilities as well as adjustments for non-cash items of $53.3 million (primarily consisting of stock-based compensation, lease impairment charge, depreciation & amortization and premiums & discounts on available-sale-securities).

92

During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $102.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $147.0 million during the period and a $8.6 million decrease in deferred revenue under our collaboration agreements. These were offset by a $11.2 million net decrease in other operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, operating lease liabilities as well as adjustments for non-cash items of $41.5 million (primarily consisting of stock-based compensation, depreciation & amortization and premiums & discounts on available-sale-securities).

During the year ended December 31, 2022, operating activities used $153.1 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $154.8 million during the period and a $37.8 million decrease in deferred revenue under our collaboration agreements. These were offset by adjustments for non-cash items of $39.3 million (primarily consisting of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and premiums and discounts on available sale-securities) and a $0.2 million net increase in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by changes in prepaid expenses and other operating assets and liabilities.

Cash Flow provided by (used in) Investing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in investing activities was $404.1 million comprised of purchases of marketable securities of $901.2 million and purchases of property and equipment of $12.8 million partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $509.9 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was $139.9 million comprised of maturities of marketable securities of $363.5 million partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $189.2 million and purchases of property and equipment of $34.4 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities was $20.5 million comprised of maturities of marketable securities of $469.3 million partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $446.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $2.8 million.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $608.9 million, consisting of $547.9 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and accompanying pre-funded warrants, net of offering costs, $48.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Cowen Sales Agreement, net of issuance costs, $11.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $2.0 million from proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by finance lease payments of $1.6 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.2 million, primarily consisting of $2.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $1.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase partially offset by finance lease payments of $0.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $153.0 million, primarily consisting of $149.8 million of net proceeds received in our August 2022 PIPE offering, $3.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $1.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase partially offset by finance lease payments of $1.1 million.

Future funding requirements

We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the later-stage clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and programs and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:

93

•
the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop; 

•
our ability to maintain our relationships with key collaborators; 

•
the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more nonclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to; 

•
the cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

•
the costs of continuing to grow our business, including hiring key personnel and maintaining or acquiring operating space; 

•
the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing, as well as product coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors; 

•
the cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies; 

•
the cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing; 

•
the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize; and 

•
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems. 

We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $850.9 million as of December 31, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We expect that we will require additional funding to continue the clinical development of our clinical programs, commercialize our product candidates if we receive regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize our product candidates.

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Market volatility resulting from macroeconomic factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

94

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

We have entered into arrangements that contractually obligate us to make payments that will affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Such arrangements primarily include those related to our lease commitments.

Lease Commitments

Our lease commitments reflect payments due for our two lease agreements for laboratory and office space in Watertown, Massachusetts that expire in March of 2030 and 2035, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our contractual commitments for our leases were $124.9 million, which will be paid over the term of such leases. For additional information on our leases and timing of future payments, please read Note 7, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Obligations

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with various third parties for clinical trials, preclinical research studies, and testing, manufacturing, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts provide for termination upon notice. Payments due upon cancellation generally consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments have not been included separately within these contractual and other obligations disclosures.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.

95

When optional goods or services are offered, we assess the options to determine whether the options grant the customer a material right. This determination includes whether the option is priced at an amount that the customer would not have received without entering into the contract. If we conclude the option conveys a material right, it is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. In identifying performance obligations in a contract, we identify those promises that are distinct. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own, or together with readily available resources, and the goods or services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promise is not distinct, it is combined with other promises in the contract until the combined group of promises is capable of being distinct.

We estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price. For contracts that include sales-based royalties for licensed compounds, we recognize revenue at the date when the related sales occur. Finally, we determine whether the contract contains a significant financing component by analyzing the promised consideration relative to the standalone selling price of the promised goods and services and the timing of payment relative to the transfer of the promised goods and services. At each reporting date, we reassess the transaction price and probability of achievement of the performance obligations and the associated constraints on transaction price. If necessary, we adjust the transaction price, recording a cumulative catch-up based on progress for the amount that was previously constrained.

Revenue is recognized when (or as) control of a performance obligation is transferred to the customer. When combined performance obligations contain a promised license and related services or other promises, management judgment is required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. In doing so, we must identify the predominant promise or promises in the contract to determine whether revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time. If over time, we must determine the appropriate measure of progress. If a license is deemed to be the predominant promise in a performance obligation, we must determine the nature of the license, whether functional or symbolic intellectual property, to conclude whether point-in-time or over-time revenue recognition is most appropriate. The determination of functional or symbolic intellectual property requires an assessment of whether the customer is able to exploit and benefit from the license in its current condition, or if the utility of the license is dependent on or influenced by our ongoing activities or being associated with us.

At each reporting date, we calculate the measure of progress for the performance obligations transferred over time. The calculation generally uses an input measure based on costs incurred to-date relative to estimated total costs to complete the transfer of the performance obligation. The measurement of progress is then used to calculate the total revenue earned, including any cumulative catch-up adjustment.

Research and Development Contract Costs and Accruals

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:

•
vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical development activities;

•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with our clinical trials and preclinical studies; and

•
CMOs in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation of preclinical studies.

We base the expense recorded related to external research and development on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.

96

Equity-Based Compensation Expense

We measure equity-based awards granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The equity-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for equity awards is the date of grant, and equity-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. We select companies with comparable characteristics to us with historical share price information that approximates the expected term of the equity-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period that approximates the calculated expected term of our stock options. We will continue to apply this method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price becomes available. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments, including cash equivalents, are in the form of money market funds and marketable securities and are invested in U.S. treasury or government obligations and corporate securities. However, because of the short-term nature of the duration of our portfolio and the low-risk profile of our investments, we believe an immediate 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair market value of our investments portfolio or on our financial condition or results of operations.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located in Asia and Europe and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these arrangements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2024, we had no significant liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, third party vendors, and clinical trial costs. The global macroeconomic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, among other concerns. We cannot predict how long these inflationary pressures will continue, or how they may change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the global economy, our industry and our company. If inflationary pressures continue to persist, they may continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. As a result of the inflationary environment, however, interest rates have increased, which has resulted in higher interest income rates than were previously realized.

The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods from a variety of countries and regions that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices. Tariffs on certain foreign origin goods continue to put pressure on input costs. If we become unable to recover a substantial portion of any increased tariff related costs from our customers, suppliers, collaborators or other third parties, the imposition of the new or increased international tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to monitor international trade policy and will make adjustments where possible to mitigate the impact on our costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Kymera Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kymera Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Collaboration Arrangement

Description of

the Matter

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue associated with each performance obligation as the research and development services are provided using an input method, according to costs incurred as related to the research and development activities for each individual program and the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy that individual performance obligation. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized $47.1 million in collaboration revenue.

Auditing the Company's accounting for revenues from collaboration arrangement was complex and required significant judgments primarily in evaluating estimates of the total expected costs under the input method for revenue recognized over time.  Auditing the progress toward completion of the collaboration arrangement was especially challenging because it involves subjective management assumptions used in estimating the remaining research and development costs necessary to satisfy the performance obligation. The calculation of the total remaining estimated research and development cost includes forecasted costs associated with internal employee efforts, materials costs, and third-party contract costs. The recognition of revenue pursuant to collaboration arrangements is subject to these judgments made and estimates developed by management and is sensitive to changes in these assumptions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s process for developing the estimate, including controls to assess the completeness and accuracy of the data that supports management’s estimates.

To test the Company’s collaboration revenue, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, reading the collaboration arrangement and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in evaluating the estimates and significant judgments described above. To assess the reasonableness of the Company's significant estimates and judgments, we compared cost estimates to costs previously incurred for similar activities, evaluated the remaining estimated level of effort required to complete the services, and inspected evidence of actual costs incurred. We also discussed the basis for key assumptions with the Company's research and development personnel, who oversee the completion of the collaboration arrangement.

KYMERA THERAPEUTICS, INC

Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Kymera Therapeutics, Inc., together with its subsidiary Kymera Securities Corporation, is referred to on a consolidated basis as the “Company”. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics that selectively degrade disease-causing proteins by harnessing the body’s own natural cellular process, a method known as targeted protein degradation. The Company has devoted its efforts principally to research and development since formation. The Company has not yet completed product development, filed for or obtained regulatory approvals for any products, nor verified the market acceptance and demand for such products. As a result, the Company is subject to a number of risks common to emerging companies in the biotech industry. Principal among these risks are the uncertainties of the product discovery and development process, dependence on key individuals, development of the same or similar technological innovations by the Company’s competitors, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and approval requirements, the Company’s ability to access capital and uncertainty of market acceptance of products.

The Company has hi
storical net losses and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and had an accumulated deficit of $
754.6
 million as o
f December 31, 2024. The Company has funded these losses principally through the issuance and sale of its convertible preferred stock to outside investors and collaborators in private equity financings, its initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on offerings, Private Investment in Public Equity, or PIPE offering and at-the market sales program as well as from cash proceeds received in connection with the Company’s corporate collaboration agreements (see Note 5). The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows until such time as it generates a level of revenue that is sufficient to support its cost structure.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities o
f $
850.9
 million. The Company believes these cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The Company expects to finance the future research and development costs of its product portfolio with its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, or through strategic financing opportunities that could include, but are not limited to future offerings of its equity, collaboration agreements, or the incurrence of debt. However, there is no guarantee that any of these strategic or financing opportunities will be executed or realized on favorable terms, if at all, and some could be dilutive to existing stockholders. If the Company fails to obtain additional future capital, it may be unable to complete its planned preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Private Investment in Public Equity “PIPE” offering
On August 18, 2022, the Company and certain accredited investors entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue to such investors in a private placement (i) an aggregate of 
2,769,228
 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $
26.00
 per share, and (ii) 
3,000,000
 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock, at a purchase price of $
25.9999
 per Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $
0.0001
 per share of common stock. The offering closed on August 22, 2022, resulting in net proceeds of $
149.8
 million after offering expenses.
2024 Follow-on Public Offerings
On January 9, 2024, the Company completed a follow-on offering of its common stock and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The Company issued and sold 
3,884,158
 shares of common stock, including full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase an additional 
1,633,663
 shares, at a public offering price of $
25.25
 per share. Additionally, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, the Company issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 
8,640,594
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
25.2499
 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price of each share of common stock less the $
0.0001
 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The aggregate gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company were approximately $
316.2
 million.

F-
9

On August 21, 2024, the Company completed a follow-on offering of its common stock and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The Company issued and sold 
2,830,533
 shares of common stock, including full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase an additional 
828,220
 shares, at a public offering price of $
40.75
 per share. Additionally, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, the Company issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 
3,519,159
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
40.7499
 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price of each share of common stock less the $
0.0001
 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The aggregate gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company were approximately $
258.7
 million.
Pre-funded warrants
In connection with certain offerings mentioned above the Company has issued pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu of common stock. As the pre-funded warrants are indexed to the Company’s common stock (and otherwise meet the requirements to be classified in equity), the Company recorded the consideration received from the issuance of the pre-funded warrants as additional paid-in capital on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time. The holders of Pre-Funded Warrants may not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 
4.99
% (or, at the election of the holder, 
9.99
%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The holders of Pre-Funded Warrants may increase or decrease such percentages not in excess of 
19.99
% by providing at least 
61
 days’ prior notice to the Company. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 
no
 pre-funded warrants were exercised. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
15,159,753
 pre-funded warrants outstanding.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note, and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Kymera Securities Corporation. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC and Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Management’s estimates and judgments are derived and continually evaluated based on available information, historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, management makes estimates based on the best information available at the time the estimate is made. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include revenue recognized under our collaboration agreements, accrual for research and development expenses, and equity-based compensation expense. As better information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior estimates.

F-
10

Segment and Geographic Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in one operating segment, which is the business of development of innovative, highly differentiated medicines that address significant health problems and that meaningfully improve patients’ lives. Segment information is further described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. These assets include investments in money market funds, U.S Treasury securities, U.S Government Agency securities, and corporate securities including commercial paper. The Company maintains its bank accounts at major financial institutions.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents the cash held to secure letters of credit associated with the Company’s facility leases.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies marketable securities with a remaining maturity of greater than 
three months
 when purchased as available-for-sale. The Company classifies investments available to fund current operations as current assets on its balance sheets. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than 
one year
 are classified as non-current. Available-for-sale securities are maintained by investment managers and consist of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S Government Agency securities, and corporate bonds. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other (expense) income, net.
At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation of impairment to determine if any unrealized losses are the result of credit losses. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. Factors considered in determining whether a loss resulted from a credit loss or other factors include the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment until the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, any historical failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse legal or regulatory events affecting the issuer or issuer’s industry, and any significant deterioration in economic conditions.
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
Level 1—
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2—
Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar asset, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3—
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.
The carrying values of the Company’s cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and certain accruals approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.

F-
11

Leases
 At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases that are economically similar to the purchase of assets are generally classified as finance leases; otherwise the leases are classified as operating leases. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of 
one year
 or less on the balance sheet. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. Lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. However, certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The Company has elected as an accounting policy to combine lease and non- lease components, such as common area maintenance, for all classes of underlying assets. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts has not historically been readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. To estimate its incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to the Company is estimated using synthetic credit rating analysis since the Company does not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operations as incurred. 
Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset as follows:

Estimated Useful Life
(in years)

Lab equipment

5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Office equipment

5 years

Computer equipment

3 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or remaining lease term

Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations.
Construction-in-progress is stated at cost, which includes direct costs attributable to the setup or construction of the related asset. Depreciation expense is not recorded on construction-in-progress until the relevant assets are completed and put into use.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets (including right-of-use assets) to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $
4.9
 million related to its move into its new corporate headquarters and its subsequent effort to sublease the previous space. The Company did 
no
t record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Warrants

The Company determines the accounting classification of warrants that are issued, as either liability or equity, by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480-10, 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity
, and then in accordance with ASC 815-40, 
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock
. Under ASC 480-10, warrants are considered liability classified if the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, obligate the issuer to settle the warrants or the underlying shares by paying cash or other assets, or must or may require settlement by issuing variable number of shares.
If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480-10, the Company assesses the requirements under ASC 815-40, which states that contracts that require or may require the issuer to settle the contract for cash are liabilities recorded at fair value, irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring that triggers the net cash settlement feature. If the warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude equity classification, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other applicable U.S. GAAP. After all relevant assessments are made, the Company concludes whether the warrants are classified as liability or equity. Liability classified warrants are required to be accounted for at fair value both on the date of issuance and on subsequent accounting period ending dates, with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations as a gain or loss. Equity classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of targeted protein degradation therapeutics, including those in the Company’s most advanced clinical stage programs. These research efforts and costs, include external research costs, personnel costs, supplies, license fees and facility related expenses. The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.
Patent Costs
All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recoverability of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses.
Financing Costs
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity units and shares are recorded as a reduction of proceeds to the equity carrying value. The Company capitalizes certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process financings as deferred offering costs until such financings are consummated. After consummation of the financing, these costs are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received from the financing. If a planned financing is abandoned, the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. There was 
no
 deferred offering costs on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Revenue Recognition
Under ASC 606, Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606
, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to the Company’s proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling prices, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling prices will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.
The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.
Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available.
For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation in order to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets.

Exclusive Licenses
—If the license granted in the arrangement is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition based on estimated remaining research and development costs. The calculation of the total remaining estimated research and development costs includes forecasted costs associated with internal employee efforts, materials costs, and third-party contract costs, as well as the assumed timing and duration of these activities. The recognition of revenue pursuant to collaboration arrangements is subject to these judgments made and estimates developed by management and is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Therefore, the measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement.
Research and Development Services
—The promises under the Company’s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company generally recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure, such as costs incurred. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under Exclusive Licenses above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are generally recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.
Customer Options
—The Company’s arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to certain optional purchases, such as the right to license a target either at the inception of the arrangement or within a pre-defined option period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to the Company at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment or upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount, and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.
Milestone Payments
—At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments based on certain events, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.

F-
15

Royalties
—For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its licensing arrangements.
Collaboration revenue—
The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808,
 Collaborative Arrangements, or 
ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, the Company first determines which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, the Company applies the five-step model described above.
Costs associated with License and Collaborative Arrangements
Costs associated with licenses of technology acquired as part of collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred and are generally included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Accounts Receivable

The Company extends credit to customers based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. The Company records receivables for all billings when amounts are due under standard terms. Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due net of applicable prompt pay discounts and other contractual adjustments as well as an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company assesses the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the customer’s ability to pay its obligation and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company will write off accounts receivable when the Company determines that they are uncollectible. In general, the Company has experienced no significant collection issues with its customers
.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Stock-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for stock awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The Company has issued stock options and restricted stock with performance-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards if the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Stock-based compensation is classified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the function to which the related services are provided. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for the portion of awards that have vested. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company’s expected dividend yield. The fair value of the underlying common shares equals the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. As the Company’s IPO was in 2020, the Company lacks a sufficient period of company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of guideline companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not

F-
16

expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each restricted common stock award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on that same date.
Compensation expense for discounted purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount and is recognized as compensation expense over the offering period.
Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, 
Income Taxes, or 
ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in income tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that a valuation allowance for any income tax benefits of which future realization is not more likely than not.
The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. The tax benefits recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is “more likely than not” to be realized following resolution of any uncertainty related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities.
Off Balance Sheet Risk and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are deposited in accounts at large financial institutions. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held. The Company maintains a portion of its cash equivalents in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Agency obligations. Cash equivalents are also invested in individual U.S Treasury securities, U.S Government Agency securities, and corporate securities including commercial paper. The Company’s marketable securities primarily consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Agency bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has adopted an investment policy that limits the amounts the Company may invest in any one type of investment. The Company has not experienced any credit losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and other changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders.

F-
17

Net Loss Per Share
The Company applies the two-class method to compute basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders when it has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (loss) for the period had been distributed. The Company’s convertible preferred stock participates in any dividends declared by the Company and are therefore considered to be participating securities. The participating securities are not required to participate in the losses of the Company, and therefore during periods of loss there is no allocation required under the two-class method.
Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including the pre-funded warrants given their nominal exercise price
. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares. For purpose of this calculation, outstanding options to purchase common stock, unvested restricted stock awards, and shares of convertible preferred stock are considered potential dilutive common shares. The Company has generated a net loss in all periods presented, and therefore the basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders are the same as the inclusion of the potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company held 
121
 securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months with an aggregate fair value of $
342.1
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 
109
 securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months with an aggregate fair value of $
229.7
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company held 
4
 securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months with an aggregate fair value of $
7.6
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 
16
 securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months with an aggregate fair value of $
36.6
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
129
 securities with a fair value of $
368.5
 million with a contractual maturity of less than 12 months and 
116
 securities with a fair value of $
362.2
 million with a contractual maturity of greater than 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 
124
 securities with a fair value of $
264.9
 million with a contractual maturity of less than 12 months and 
27
 securities with a fair value of $
61.4
 million with a contractual maturity of greater than 12 months.

The Company is required to determine whether a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities is due to credit-related factors. At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation of impairment to determine if any unrealized losses are the result of credit losses. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. Factors considered in determining whether a loss resulted from a credit loss or other factors include the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment until the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, any historical failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse legal or regulatory events affecting the issuer or issuer’s industry, and any significant deterioration in economic conditions.

Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities presented in the previous table have not been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations because the securities are high credit quality, investment grade securities that the Company does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is attributable to factors other than credit losses. Based on its evaluation, the Company determined it does 
no
t have any credit losses related to its available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Note 5. Collaborations
Sanofi Collaboration Arrangement
Agreement Terms
On July 7, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Sanofi Agreement, with Sanofi, to co-develop drug candidates directed to two biological targets. Under the Sanofi Agreement, the Company granted to Sanofi a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain lead compounds generated during the collaboration directed against IRAK4, or Collaboration Target 1, and one additional undisclosed target in an undisclosed field of use, or Collaboration Target 2. Such license is exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis only after specified milestones. For compounds directed against IRAK4, the field of use includes diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation or prevention of any diseases, disorders or conditions, excluding oncology and immuno-oncology.
Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, the Company is responsible for discovery and preclinical research and conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial for at least one degrader directed against IRAK4 plus up to three backup degraders. With respect to both targets, Sanofi is responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of product candidates after a specified development milestone occurs with respect to each collaboration candidate.
In addition, pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi will grant to the Company an exclusive option, or Opt-In Right, exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis that will include the right to (i) fund 50% of the United States development costs for collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use and (ii) share equally in the net profits and net losses of commercializing collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use in the United States. In addition, if the Company exercises the Opt-In Right, Sanofi will grant to the Company an exclusive option, applicable to each collaboration target, which upon exercise will allow the Company to conduct certain co-promotion activities in the field in the United States.
The Sanofi Agreement, unless earlier terminated, will expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of expiration of all payment obligations under the Sanofi Agreement with respect to such product. The Company or Sanofi may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or insolvency or for certain patent challenges. In addition, Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement for convenience or for a material safety event upon advance prior written notice, and the Company may terminate the Sanofi Agreement with respect to any collaboration candidate if, following Sanofi’s assumption of responsibility for the development, commercialization or manufacturing of collaboration candidates with respect to a particular target, Sanofi ceases to exploit any collaboration candidates directed to such target for a specified period.
In consideration for the exclusive licenses granted to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi paid to us an upfront payment of $
150.0
 million. In addition to the upfront payment, under the agreement we were eligible to receive certain development milestone payments of up to $
1.48
 billion, and commercial milestone payments of up to $
700.0
 million, in the aggregate. Of these milestones, we remain eligible to receive up to $
1.0
 billion in development milestones upon the achievement of certain developmental or regulatory events, and up to $
400
 million in commercial milestones which are payable upon the achievement of certain net sales thresholds, all of which are related to the IRAK4 program. We will further be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to high teens, subject to low-single digits upward adjustments in certain circumstances.
On November 15, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement with Sanofi, or the Amended Sanofi Agreement, which amended the Original Sanofi Agreement to revise certain research terms and responsibilities set forth under the Original Sanofi Agreement. The Amended Sanofi Agreement also specifies details around the timing and number of Phase 2 trials required under the terms of the collaboration. The Amended Sanofi Agreement became effective on December 5, 2022.

Additionally with respect to Sanofi, on December 2, 2022, Sanofi provided the Company with written notice of its intention to advance the collaboration target 1 candidate, KT-474, into Phase 2 clinical trials. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company achieved two milestones of $
40.0
 million and $
15.0
 million relating to the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 clinical trial for the first and second indications, respectively. 
Further, in July 2024, the Company announced that Sanofi intends to expand the ongoing Phase 2 trials to more rapidly progress towards pivotal studies with the intention of accelerating overall timelines.

In September 2023, the Company and Sanofi mutually agreed to cease activities related to Collaboration Target 2.

Accounting Treatment

The Company analyzed the discovery and preclinical research activities as well as the exclusive license grants under the Sanofi Agreement and concluded that the arrangement was indicative of a vendor-customer relationship and would be accounted for under ASC 606.

The Company identified the following material promises under the arrangement: (1) research services for Collaboration Target 1, (2) research license for Collaboration Target 1, (3) exclusive license for Collaboration Target 1, (4) research services for Collaboration Target 2, (5) research license for Collaboration Target 2, (6) exclusive license for Collaboration Target 2, (7) option to extend the research term, and (8) optional research services during the development period.

The Company determined that Collaboration Targets 1 and 2 are distinct from each other. The research associated with degraders directed to each target is at different stages and the licensed field, should development activities be successful, are different from each other. As such, all promises associated with each target are considered distinct from promises associated with the other target.
The research and development services for each collaboration target were determined not to be distinct from the research license and the exclusive license and have been combined into a single performance obligation for each collaboration target. That is, two performance obligations were identified, the combined research services, research license and exclusive license for Collaboration Target 1 and the combined research services, research license and exclusive license for Collaboration Target 2. The exclusive license for each target is not distinct from the preclinical and clinical research and development services under the Sanofi Agreement, primarily due to the highly specialized nature of the research and novel technology involved with developing protein degraders – the preclinical activities and studies and first phase 1 clinical trial could not be conducted by another party in the manner required.
The option to extend the research term and optional research services during the development period were evaluated as material rights. The fees associated with each option are at or above the standalone selling price. As such, the underlying options are not performance obligations and fees associated with each option are excluded from the transaction price until the underlying option is exercised.
The Company determined the total transaction price to be $
150.0
 million, which consists solely of the upfront payment. All milestone payments and option payments were constrained as the achievement of such milestones are contingent upon the success of the underlying research and development activities and are generally outside the control of the Company. The reimbursement of costs for the IRAK4 backup degrader is also treated as constrained variable consideration as the criteria for reimbursement may not always be met, under which circumstances the Company would be responsible for the costs related to the backup degrader. Upon becoming unconstrained, the reimbursement consideration will be added to the transaction price and allocated to Collaboration Target 1.
The Company allocated the upfront payment to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price, as follows:
•
Collaboration Target 1: $
120.0
 million
•
Collaboration Target 2: $
30.0
 million
The Company determined the allocation of the $
150.0
 million transaction price between Collaboration Target 1 and Collaboration Target 2 based on the value of the research and development for the programs from projected research and development costs for each collaboration target plus a developer’s profit and the total potential milestones for each collaboration target.
The Company recognizes revenue associated with each performance obligation as the research and development services are provided using an input method, according to costs incurred as related to the research and development activities for each individual program and the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy that individual performance obligation. The transfer of control occurs over this time period and, in management’s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying each performance obligation. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining research and development period until the performance obligation is satisfied. Milestone and reimbursement consideration added to the transaction price will be recognized as revenue with a cumulative catch-up upon becoming unconstrained. The performance obligation associated with Collaboration Target 1 has not been fully satisfied as of December 31, 2024. The performance obligation associated with Collaboration Target 2 has been fully satisfied. D
uring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
47.1
 million 
in revenue under the Sanofi Agreement all of which was associated with Collaboration

F-
22

Target 
1.  Of the $
47.1
 million of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2024, $
41.5
 million was recognized from amounts that were recorded in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations and recorded in deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 is $
13.6
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $
70.2
 million in revenue under the Sanofi Agreement, of which $
67.7
 million was associated with Collaboration Target 1 and $
2.5
 million was associated with Collaboration Target 2. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations and recorded in deferred revenue at December 31, 2023 is $
54.7
 million. The decrease in deferred revenue between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is the result of on-going activity under the collaboration agreement as well as a $
19.4
 million cumulative catch-up to revenue related to the change in expected future costs to satisfy the Company’s performance obligation under Collaboration Target 1. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $
36.0
 million in revenue under the Sanofi Agreement, of which $
19.4
 million was associated with Collaboration Target 1 and $
16.6
 million was associated with Collaboration Target 2. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company received $
8.8
 million and $
13.8
 million, respectively, in cost reimbursement payments under the Sanofi Agreement. The Company recorded $
0.9
 million and $
3.8
 million of unbilled accounts receivable related to reimbursable research and development costs under the Sanofi Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company will recognize the deferred revenue related to the performance obligations based on a cost input method, as described, over the remaining research term, which as a result of the amended agreement, is a maximum of approximately 
0.5
 years as of December 31, 2024.
Any additional consideration related to performance-based milestones will be recognized when the risk of probable reversal is resolved, at which point the Company shall adjust the transaction price determined for the agreement accordingly and recognize revenue on a cumulative-catch up basis, reallocating the revised arrangement consideration to the performance obligations. Any consideration related to sales milestone payments and royalties will be recognized when the related milestone events or sales occur and therefore are recognized at the later of when the related sales occur or the relevant performance obligation is satisfied. As part of its evaluation of constraining the milestones, the Company considered numerous factors, including the fact that the achievement of the research and development milestones are contingent upon the results of the underlying research and development activities and are thus outside of the control of the Company. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company achieved two development milestones relating to the dosing of the first patient in the KT-474 Phase 2 clinical trials for the first and second indications, respectively. In connection with these milestones the Company unconstrained $
55.0
 million of consideration resulting in a $
40.3
 million cumulative catch up recorded to revenue with the remaining $
14.7
 million recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $
51.4
 million of the $
55.0
 million of consideration has been recorded as revenue, with the remaining $
3.6
 million recorded as deferred revenue.
Vertex Agreement

On May 9, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Vertex Agreement”) with Vertex to advance small molecule protein degraders against up to six targets. Under the Vertex Agreement, Vertex had the exclusive option to license the rights to the product candidates developed for the designated targets at which point Vertex would control development and commercialization. Pursuant to the Vertex Agreement, the Company was only responsible for discovery and preclinical research on the targets, and Vertex was responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the product candidates after it exercises its option to license. The initial research term of the collaboration was four (
4
) years, extendable for an additional one (
1
) year period upon mutual agreement by the parties and payment by Vertex of certain per-target fees.

The Company was eligible to receive up to $
170.0
 million in payments per target, including development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as option exercise payments. In addition, Vertex was obligated to pay the Company tiered royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from the Vertex Agreement. None of the payments under the Vertex Agreement are refundable.

The term of the Vertex Agreement began on the Effective Date and expired upon the completion of the initial research term on May 9, 2023.
Accounting Treatment

The Company analyzed the joint research activities required under the Vertex Agreement and concluded that the arrangement was indicative of a vendor-customer relationship and would be accounted for under ASC 606.

The Company identified the following material promises under the arrangement: (1) the non-exclusive, royalty-free research license; (2) the research and development services to be performed on up to six targets; and (3) the option to license each of the targets for development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts. The research and development services

F-
23

were determined not to be distinct from the research and development license and have been combined into a single performance obligation. The Company determined that the option to license the targets in the future was not priced at a discount, and that the option exercise fee for each target is at or above the standalone selling price for research at this stage of development; as such, the options and the underlying licenses are excluded from the performance obligation and the option exercise fees are excluded from the transaction price until the underlying option is exercised.

As part of its evaluation of constraining the research and development milestones, the Company considered numerous factors, including the fact that the achievement of the research and development milestones are contingent upon the results of the underlying research and development activities and are thus outside of the control of the Company.
At the commencement of the arrangement, two units of accounting were identified, the issuance of 
3,059,695
 shares of the Company’s Series B-1 and the research activities the Company will perform over the Research Term. The Company determined the total transaction price to be $
55.9
 million, which consists of $
5.9
 million attributed to the premium from the Series B-1 shares sold to Vertex and the $
50.0
 million upfront payment. To determine the fair value of the Series B-1 issued to Vertex, the Company performed a valuation of the shares of the Company’s common and preferred stock, which took into consideration recent financings, and the Company’s recent development and future exit strategies, as well as a discount for lack of marketability.

The Company recognizes revenue associated with the performance obligation as the research and development services are provided using an input method, according to the costs incurred as related to the research and development activities on each program and the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. The transfer of control occurs over this time period and, in management’s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. The Vertex collaboration agreement expired upon completion of the initial research term in May of 2023. Accordingly, the Company fully satisfied its performance obligation and recognized all remaining deferred revenue associated with the Vertex collaboration in May 2023. The Company did 
no
t recognize any revenue under the Vertex agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
8.4
 million, $
10.8
 million, respectively, in revenue under the Vertex Agreement.

Note 7. Leases

In October 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable facility lease agreement (the “2019 Lease”) for 
34,522
 square feet of research and development and office space in Watertown, Massachusetts. The term of the 2019 Lease is 
120
 months and expires on 
March 31, 2030
. The 2019 Lease has an option to be extended for an additional 
five years
. The lease is not reasonably certain to be extended and as such the additional term is not included in the measurement of the lease. The 2019 Lease includes a rent escalation clause, and rent expense is being recorded on a straight-line basis. In accordance with the lease agreement, the Company is required to maintain a security deposit and provided a letter of credit to the landlord, which is recorded in restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The letter of credit totaled $
1.3
 million and $
1.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
In December 2021, the Company entered into a noncancelable lease (the “2021 Lease”) for 
100,624
 square feet of office and laboratory space in Watertown, Massachusetts, which the Company began occupying in 
February 2024
. The 2021 Lease is subject to base rent of $
0.8
 million per month beginning two months after the commencement date, plus the Company’s ratable share of taxes, maintenance and other operating expenses. Base rent is subject to a 
3
% annual increase over the lease term of approximately 
134
 months following the commencement date. The Company also has two consecutive options to extend the term of the lease for 
five years
 each at then-market rates. The 2021 Lease also includes a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $
20.1
 million. In connection with the signing of the 2021 Lease, the Company issued a letter of credit for $
4.5
 million which is classified as restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The 2021 Lease required the landlord to build-out the base building prior to the construction of the Company’s premises. The Company concluded the accounting commencement date occurred when the landlord completed the build-out of the base building and control passed to the Company, which occurred in early January 2023. The Company assessed the classification of the 2021 Lease at the accounting commencement date and concluded the lease should be accounted for as an operating lease. The Company recorded an operating lease liability of $
48.9
 million, measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of the accounting commencement date. The Company recorded an operating lease right-of-use asset of $
48.9
 million, measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, net of the tenant incentives.

F-
25

The Company concluded the improvements paid for by the landlord in connection with the tenant improvement allowance represent lessee assets and therefore recorded $
20.1
 million of leasehold improvements in property and equipment. The Company recorded an additional $
17.9
 million of leasehold improvements in excess of the tenant improvement allowance, all of which were placed in service as of December 31, 2024.

Upon occupancy of the 2021 Lease facility in February of 
2024
, the Company exited the 2019 Lease facility and is actively looking to sublease the entire facility for the remaining noncancellable lease term through March 31, 2030. These actions resulted in an impairment charge of $
4.9
 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate the potential recovery of the ROU asset under sublease scenarios, and thus it is possible that additional impairments could be identified in future periods, and such amounts could be material.
The impairment charge reduces the carrying value of the associated ROU asset, leasehold improvements and certain furniture and fixture assets that remained in the facility to their estimated fair values. The fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flows approach based on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the property based on current sublease market rent, which is considered a level 3 input in the fair value hierarchy, and other key assumptions such as future sublease market conditions and the discount rate.
The Company’s finance lease obligations consist of certain property and equipment financed through finance leases. .

Note 9. Other Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation as the Company operates in an industry susceptible to patent legal claims. The Company accounts for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings and claims when such losses are probable and estimable. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed when incurred. The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings.
Indemnification Arrangements
As permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its investors, employees, officers, and directors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) for certain events or occurrences while the Indemnified Parties are, or were serving, at its request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the Indemnified Parties’ lifetime. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with any U.S. patent or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company’s products. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company is not aware of any claims under indemnification arrangements, and it has 
no
t accrued any liabilities related to such obligations as of December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Note 10. Equity-Based Compensation

2018 Stock Option and Grant Plan

In November 2018, the Company adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2018 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the “2018 Plan”), which provides for the granting of stock options and other equity-based awards at the discretion of the Board of Directors or any subcommittee of the Board of Directors to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, and independent contractors. No further grants will be made under the 2018 Plan. However, the 2018 Plan will continue to govern outstanding equity awards granted thereunder. To the extent outstanding options granted under the 2018 Plan are cancelled, forfeited or otherwise terminated without being exercised and would otherwise have been returned to the share reserve under the 2018 Plan, the number of shares underlying such awards will be available for future grant under the 2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.

2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan

In August 2020, the Company and its stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), which became effective on August 20, 2020. The 2020 Plan replaced the 2018 Plan as the Company’s Board of Directors has determined not to make additional awards under the 2018 Plan following the closing of the Company’s IPO. The 2020 Plan allows the Company to make equity-based and cash-based incentive awards to its officers, employees, directors and consultants. The Company has initially reserved 
4,457,370
 shares of its common stock for the issuance of awards under the 2020 Plan, which includes the shares of common stock remaining available for issuance under its 2018 Plan as of the business day immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement. In June 2024, in connection with the Company’s 2024 annual shareholder meeting, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2020 stock option plan that redefined the definition of common stock outstanding for the purposes of calculating the annual increase to the shares available for issuance. After the amendment, outstanding equity includes all outstanding common shares as well as outstanding pre-funded warrants. The 2020 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase on January 1, 2021, and each January 1 thereafter, by 
4
% of the Company’s outstanding number of shares of common stock, inclusive of outstanding pre-funded warrants, on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company’s compensation committee. These limits are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company’s capitalization. As of December 31, 2024, there were an aggregate 
of 
3,556,290
 shar

In August 2020, the Company and its stockholders approved the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2020 ESPP”), which became effective August 20, 2020. The 2020 ESPP initially reserves and authorizes the issuance of up to a total of 
445,653
 shares of common stock to participating employees. 
The 2020 ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase on January 1, 2021 and each January 1 thereafter through January 1, 2030, by the lessor of (i) 
438,898
 shares of common stock, (ii) 
1
% of the Company’s outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or (iii) such lesser number of shares of common stock as determined by the administrator of the 2020 ESPP.
 The number of shares reserved under the 2020 ESPP is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company’s capitalization. As of December 31, 2024, there were an aggregate of 
1,924,229
 shares remaining available for future grants.

The Company has had immaterial income tax expense due to operating losses incurred since inception and no deferred tax provision in the current period. ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Based on this, the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets as the realization of the deferred tax assets is not determined to be more likely than not. During 2024, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $
74
 million primarily due to the increase in the Company’s book loss reported in the period and the generation of additional research and development credits.

Beginning in 2022, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) amended Section 174 and now requires U.S.-based and non-U.S-based research and experimental (R&E) expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over a period of five or 15 years, respectively, for amounts paid in tax years starting after December 31, 2021. Prior to the TCJA amendment, Section 174 allowed taxpayers to immediately deduct R&E expenditures in the year paid or incurred. The Company has applied this required change in accounting method beginning in 2022 and the computation may be adjusted pending future IRS guidance.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
221.3
 million and $
238.3
 million of Federal & State operating loss carryforwards respectively. Of the Federal net operating loss carryovers, $
211.5
 million are not subject to expiration and the remaining Federal and state NOLs begin to expire in 
2037
. These loss carryforwards are available to reduce future federal taxable income, if any.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company also has federal and state research and development credit carryforwards and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately $
33.1
 million and $
12.0
 million respectively, which can be used to offset future income taxes. These credits will begin to expire beginning in December 2032. These loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities. The amount of loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be limited based upon changes in the ownership of the Company’s ultimate parent.

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and recorded in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance, among other provisions. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company has not recorded tax reserves associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense, if any, in its statements of income. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had 
no
 reserves for uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
no
 estimated interest or penalties were recognized on uncertain tax positions.

The Company’s federal and Massachusetts income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 
2024
 remain open and are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities. In addition, the Company’s tax carryover attributes such as net operating losses or credits from earlier period are also subject to examination.

The Company’s potentially dilutive securities, which include restricted stock units, and stock options, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same. 
The Company excluded the following from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

Note 14. Segment Reporting
The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable segment and one operating segment, which is dedicated to reinventing the treatment of human disease through the development of innovative, highly differentiated medicines that address significant health problems and that meaningfully improve patients’ lives. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is the chief executive officer. The CODM assesses performance for the segment and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net loss that is also reported on the consolidated statements of operations.
The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total consolidated assets. All material long-lived assets are located in the United States. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net, and operating lease right-of-use assets.
The chief operating decision maker uses net loss to monitor budget versus actual results and to analyze cash flows in assessing performance of the segment and allocating resources.
Factors used in determining the reportable segment include the nature of the Company’s operating activities, the organizational and reporting structure and the type of information reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources and evaluate financial performance. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table presents reportable segment profit and loss, including significant expense categories, attributable to the Company’s reportable segment for the periods presented:

Item 9A. Controls
 and Procedures.

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by a company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of a company’s assets;

•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that a company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and directors; and

•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report of our internal control over financial reporting.  This report appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Kymera Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Kymera Therapeutics, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Kymera Therapeutics, Inc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
