Macroeconomic Considerations
Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the U.S., Canada and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, including changes in inflation and interest rates, changes in international trade policies and tariffs and geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East, have led to economic uncertainty globally. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. 
For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to macroeconomic events that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled
 “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report.

Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of any products unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize IMVT-1402, batoclimab or any future product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend completely on the successful development and eventual commercialization of IMVT-1402, batoclimab and any future product candidates.

Research and Development Expenses
We have been primarily engaged in preparing for and conducting clinical trials. Research and development expenses include therapeutic area-specific costs, as well as unallocated costs, and are net of costs reimbursable to the Company pursuant to cost-sharing arrangements with third parties.
Therapeutic area-specific costs include direct third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates with respect to a specific therapeutic area, investigator grants, sponsored research, and any other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of the product candidates. Therapeutic area-specific costs also include contract manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, including under our agreements with Samsung, to the extent they can be allocated to a specific therapeutic area.
Unallocated costs include:
•
personnel-related expenses for research and development personnel, which include employee-related expenses such as salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs;
•
stock-based compensation expenses for research and development personnel;
•
costs allocated to us under our services agreements with Roivant Sciences Inc. (“RSI”) and Roivant Sciences GmbH (“RSG”) (the “Services Agreements”); and
•
other expenses, which include the cost of consultants who assist with our research and development but are not allocated to a specific therapeutic area.
Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect to incur research and development expenses as we continue our Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of TED and a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial of batoclimab as a treatment for GD. With respect to our IMVT-1402 development activities, our Phase 1 clinical trial of IMVT-1402 in New Zealand remains open and we initiated potentially registrational trials for IMVT-1402 in GD, D2T RA, MG and CIDP and a proof-of-concept trial in CLE. We also plan to initiate a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in SjD and a second potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in GD. Our research and development expenses are also expected to continue to increase over the next several years as we execute IMVT-1402 trials, increase manufacturing of IMVT-1402, hire personnel and prepare to seek regulatory approval. It is not possible to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of any clinical trial we may conduct. 
The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of IMVT-1402, batoclimab and any future product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the per patient trial costs;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trial is conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory authorities;
•
the duration of patient follow-up;
•
the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals;
•
the potential impact of macroeconomic events, including changes in inflation, interest rates and international trade policies and tariffs and geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; and
•
the cost of manufacturing.
In addition, the probability of success for our product candidates will depend on numerous factors, including our product’s efficacy, safety, ease of use, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.

Table of Contents
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development expenses include payments made or due upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones under the HanAll Agreement.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation for general and administrative personnel, legal and accounting fees, consulting services, costs allocated under the Services Agreements and other operating costs relating to corporate matters and daily operations.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to support our ongoing research and development activities. These expenses will likely include patent-related costs, including legal and professional fees for filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents and patent applications claiming our product candidates, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants for professional services. In addition, if either IMVT-1402 or batoclimab obtains regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significant additional expenses associated with market research activities and building commercial teams.

*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Fiscal 2025 vs. Fiscal 2024
For the year ended March 31, 2025, research and development expenses increased $148.0 million as compared with the prior year.
For the year ended March 31, 2025, therapeutic area-specific research and development costs, including contract manufacturing costs, increased $91.1 million as compared with the prior year. Research and development costs related to endocrine diseases, which include GD and TED, increased $29.9 million. This increase was primarily due to preparation and initiation of our potentially registrational trial of IMVT-1402 in endocrine diseases and higher overall clinical trial costs related to our batoclimab Phase 3 clinical program. Research and development costs related to neurological diseases, which include MG and CIDP, increased $52.2 million. This increase was primarily due to preparation for our potentially registrational clinical trials of IMVT-1402 in neurological diseases and higher overall clinical trial costs related to our batoclimab Phase 3 and Phase 2b clinical trials. Research and development costs related to rheumatology diseases of $23.9 million in the current year reflected the initiation of our potentially registrational trial of IMVT-1402 in RA, as well as preparation for our potentially registrational trial of IMVT-1402 in SjD. Research and development costs related to dermatology diseases of $15.6 million in the current year reflected the initiation of our proof-of-concept trial in CLE. Research and development costs related to other clinical and nonclinical activities decreased $30.5 million, reflecting the current year transition to clinical activities targeting specific therapeutic areas, as well as lower overall costs related to our IMVT-1402 Phase 1 trial and nonclinical studies.
For the year ended March 31, 2025, unallocated research and development costs increased $56.9 million as compared with the prior year. This increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses of $37.2 million, driven by higher headcount and enhancement of our capabilities to support our strategic objectives as we progress our clinical activities. In addition, other expenses increased $19.7 million, primarily reflecting higher costs to support our research and development activities to advance the clinical development of IMVT-1402 that are not related to a specific therapeutic area.
109
Table of Contents
Fiscal 2024 vs. Fiscal 2023
For the year ended March 31, 2024, research and development expenses increased $52.7 million as compared with the prior year.
For the year ended March 31, 2024, therapeutic area-specific research and development costs, including contract manufacturing costs for drug substance process performance qualification activities, increased $30.0 million as compared with the prior year. Research and development costs related to endocrine diseases, which include TED and GD, increased $6.8 million, primarily reflecting higher clinical trial costs, due in part to the initiation of our batoclimab proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial. Research and development costs related to neurological diseases, which include MG and CIDP, decreased $11.0 million, primarily reflecting higher overall batoclimab clinical trial costs in the prior year that included upfront and start-up costs for our Phase 3 and Phase 2b clinical trials. Research and development costs related to other clinical and nonclinical activities increased $34.3 million, primarily reflecting higher IMVT-1402 contract manufacturing costs and costs related to our IMVT-1402 Phase 1 clinical trial and pre-clinical study.
For the year ended March 31, 2024, unallocated research and development costs increased $22.6 million as compared with the prior year. This increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses of $24.5 million, primarily reflecting higher headcount and enhancement of our capabilities to support our strategic objectives to progress our clinical activities in existing and new indications. Partially offsetting this increase were lower costs related to cross-indication research and development activities supporting IMVT-1402 and batoclimab programs of $1.9 million, primarily reflecting our shift to project-related activities to advance the clinical development of batoclimab, including our clinical trials in MG, TED, CIDP and GD, and IMVT-1402.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
There were no acquired in-process research and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2025. During the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, acquired in-process research and development expenses were $12.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to the achievement of development and regulatory milestones for batoclimab under the terms of the HanAll Agreement.
General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended March 31, 2025, general and administrative expenses increased $20.0 million from the year ended March 31, 2024, primarily reflecting higher personnel-related expenses, professional fees, information technology costs and market research costs. For the year ended March 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased $9.3 million from the year ended March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher personnel-related expenses, market research costs, legal and other professional fees and information technology costs.
Interest Income
For the year ended March 31, 2025, interest income decreased $0.2 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2024, primarily reflecting lower average money market balances throughout the year, mostly offset by interest earned on money market fund balances as a result of the proceeds from our January 2025 private placement. For the year ended March 31, 2024, interest income increased $17.4 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting interest earned on higher money market fund balances as a result of proceeds from our October 2023 underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We had cash and cash equivalents of $714.0 million and $635.4 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 we had net losses of $413.8 million, $259.3 million and $211.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We have never generated any revenue and we do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for IMVT-1402, batoclimab or any future product candidate. 
110
Table of Contents
To date, we have financed our operations primarily from equity offerings. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue from sales of IMVT-1402, batoclimab or any future product candidate, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and the continuing disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide, disruptions resulting from geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and changes in inflation, interest rates and international trade policies and tariffs.
We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
We have a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (“Leerink Partners”), as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock (the “ATM Shares”), subject to certain conditions as specified in the sales agreement. We agreed to pay Leerink Partners up to 3% of the gross proceeds from each sale of ATM Shares sold through the sales agreement. The ATM Shares would be sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale and, as a result, prices may vary. The ATM Shares to be sold under the sales agreement, if any, would be issued and sold pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which we filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023, along with a prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of up to $150.0 million of ATM Shares pursuant to the sales agreement. We have not issued or sold any ATM Shares pursuant to the ATM offering program.
In January 2025, we entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued 22,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to certain institutional accredited investors (including 16,845,010 shares of common stock to RSL), at a price of $20.00 per share in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The gross proceeds to us were approximately $450.0 million. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement with certain of the investors, we subsequently filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275419), which automatically became effective upon its filing on November 9, 2023, covering the resale of 5,654,990 shares of common stock issued in the private placement. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to keep such registration statement effective until the date the shares described above have been sold or may be resold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without restriction.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves or potentially discontinue operations.

Operating Activities
For the year ended March 31, 2025, $375.9 million of cash was used in operating activities, primarily reflecting a net loss from operations for the year of $413.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $12.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $50.0 million. The non-cash charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $49.5 million, reflecting the higher headcount and incentive equity awards as compared with the prior year. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected higher prepaid expenses and other current assets of $27.0 million, driven primarily by the timing of payments and services performed related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials, as well as an increase in other assets of $7.7 million as a result of prepaid expenses related to planned contract manufacturing activities. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $10.7 million, primarily related to clinical trial costs. Accrued expenses increased $8.9 million, primarily reflecting the timing of payments and services related to our ongoing clinical trials and contract manufacturing. In addition, accounts receivable decreased $3.2 million, reflecting the collection of amounts owed to us under research and development cost-sharing arrangements with a third party. 
For the year ended March 31, 2024, $214.2 million of cash was used in operating activities, primarily reflecting a net loss from operations for the year of $259.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $42.5 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.6 million. The non-cash charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $41.1 million, reflecting the higher headcount and incentive equity awards as compared with the prior year. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.1 million, primarily reflecting the timing and level of payments for contract manufacturing and other research and development costs, and lower prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.6 million, driven primarily by the timing of payments and services performed related to our ongoing clinical trials. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $4.6 million, reflecting amounts owed to us under a research and development cost-sharing arrangement with a third party.
For the year ended March 31, 2023, $188.2 million of cash was used in operating activities, primarily reflecting a net loss from operations of $211.0 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $10.8 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $33.6 million. The non-cash charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $32.3 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease of $17.1 million in accounts payable driven by the timing of payments related to contract manufacturing costs. The change in operating assets and liabilities also reflected $20.1 million of higher prepaid expenses and other current assets, driven by payments related to clinical research and contract manufacturing activities. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of $15.6 million primarily related to contract manufacturing costs, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $11.8 million reflecting the collection of amounts owed to us under research and development cost-sharing arrangements with third parties.
Investing Activities
For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities was related to the purchase of equipment for our expanded workforce.
Financing Activities
For the year ended March 31, 2025, $454.5 million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from our January 2025 private placement of $450.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities also reflected $4.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
For the year ended March 31, 2024, $472.4 million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from our October 2023 underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement of $466.7 million, combined, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees and offering expenses. Cash provided by financing activities also reflected $5.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
For the year ended March 31, 2023, $70.9 million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from our October 2022 underwritten offering of approximately $70.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Cash provided by financing activities also reflected $0.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Material Cash Requirements
Our primary uses of capital have been, and we expect will continue to be, for advancing our clinical and nonclinical development programs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our net losses and operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials, timing of IMVT-1402 or batoclimab manufacturing, HanAll milestone payments and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of product candidates.
Our short-term and long-term material cash requirements as of 
March 31, 2025
 primarily consisted of those related to our clinical trials and clinical development activities, which we expect to fund primarily with our existing cash balance. Our most significant cash requirements are described below: 
Product Service Agreement 
During the year ended March 31, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Samsung to manufacture a certain quantity of batoclimab drug substance for, among other things, commercial sale, if approved. As of March 31, 2025, in connection with this agreement, we have a remaining minimum obligation to Samsung of approximately $43.6 million, of 
which $5.5 million, $10.1 million, $14.0 million and 
$14.0 
million is expected to be paid during the fiscal years ending March 31, 2026, 2028, 
2029
 and 
2030, 
respectively.
 See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 – Material Agreements for additional details.
HanAll Agreement
Potential future payments due under the HanAll Agreement are contingent upon future events. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate maximum amount of milestone payments we could be required to make under the HanAll Agreement is $420.0 million (after an aggregate amount of $32.5 million paid for milestone events achieved as of March 31, 2025) upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestone events. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we achieved our third and fourth development and regulatory milestone events under the HanAll Agreement and made a $12.5 million milestone payment in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the agreement. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we achieved our second development and regulatory milestone event under the HanAll Agreement and made a $10.0 million milestone payment in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
Outlook
We currently expect our existing cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025 of $714.0 million will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for announced indications to date through our GD readout expected in 2027.
Except as discussed above, we did not have any other ongoing material contractual obligations for which cash flows were fixed and determinable. We expect to enter into other commitments as the business further develops. In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for nonclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes, which agreements are generally cancellable by us at any time, subject to payment of remaining obligations under binding purchase orders and, in certain cases, nominal early-termination fees. These commitments are not deemed significant. There are certain contracts wherein we have a minimum purchase commitment, however, most of it is due and payable within one year.
We anticipate that our short-term and long-term future capital requirements will increase as we:
•
fund our clinical development programs;
•
launch any potential clinical trials of IMVT-1402 in additional indications;
•
increase manufacturing of IMVT-1402 drug substance to support clinical trials;
•
achieve milestones under our agreements with third parties, including the HanAll Agreement, that will require us to make substantial payments to those parties;
113
Table of Contents
•
integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire scientific, clinical, quality control and administrative personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development efforts;
•
commence the number of clinical trials required for approval;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
seek to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;
•
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
•
incur insurance, legal and other regulatory compliance expenses to operate as a public company.
Our primary use of cash is to fund our clinical trials, clinical development and manufacturing activities. Our current funds will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development and, if approved, commercially launch IMVT-1402 or batoclimab. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We define our critical accounting estimates as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in “Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we believe the following critical accounting estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires significant estimates and judgments. We did not make any material changes to these assumptions for the year ended March 31, 2025. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions during the year ended March 31, 2025.
Research and Development Expenses and Related Accruals
Research and development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by contract research organizations. In making these estimates, we consider various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of employee compensation and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities (including manufacturing) on our behalf.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
As of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $714.0 million, all of which are maintained in accredited financial institutions. Our cash equivalents consist of money market funds invested in high-quality, short-term securities that are issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income volatility, which is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates; however, due to the nature of our account portfolio, an immediate hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our liquidity.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Our employees and our operations are currently primarily located in the United States and our expenses are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We therefore are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars as we have contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors. We believe an immediate hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material effect on our liquidity or our consolidated financial statements.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our research and development and contract manufacturing costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as of March 31, 2025.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Immunovant, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Immunovant, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders
’
 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company
’
s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated May 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
’
s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Clinical Trial Accrual
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by contract research organizations. In making these estimates, the Company considers various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment.
Auditing the Company’s accrual for clinical trial costs is complex due to the fact that information necessary to estimate the accruals is accumulated from clinical research organizations and the Company's assessment of that information is subject to variability and uncertainty. In addition, in certain circumstances, the determination of the nature and amount of services that have been received during the reporting period requires judgment because the timing and pattern of vendor invoicing does not correspond to the level of services provided and there may be delays in invoicing from clinical study sites and other vendors.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that addressed the identified risks related to the information used in the Company’s process for recording clinical trial accruals. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of clinical trial progress in comparison to information and invoices received from third parties, and over the completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate the accrual.
To test the clinical trial accrual, our audit procedures included, among others, reading a sample of the Company’s agreements with the service providers to understand key financial and contractual terms and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the accrual computations. We also evaluated management’s estimates of the vendor’s progress for a sample of clinical trials by making direct inquiries of the Company’s operations personnel overseeing the clinical trials and obtaining information directly from certain service providers about the service providers’ estimate of costs that had been incurred through March 31, 2025. To evaluate the completeness of the accruals, we also examined subsequent invoices from the service providers and cash disbursements to the service providers, to the extent such invoices were received, or payments were made prior to the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — 
Organization and Nature of Business
[A] Description of Business
Immunovant, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Immunovant”) is a clinical-stage immunology company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. The Company’s innovative product pipeline includes its product candidates, IMVT-1402 and batoclimab (formerly referred to as IMVT-1401), both of which are novel, fully human, monoclonal antibodies that target the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (“FcRn”). Designed to be optimized as simple, subcutaneous injections, IMVT-1402 and batoclimab have been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibody levels, which has provided evidence supporting the use of an anti-FcRn antibody in disease areas associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies.
Immunovant, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries include Immunovant Treasury Inc., a Delaware corporation based in the United States (“U.S.”), and Immunovant Sciences Ltd. (“ISL”), a Bermuda exempted limited company. Incorporated by ISL are its wholly owned subsidiaries, Immunovant Sciences Holdings Ltd. (“ISHL”), a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the laws of England and Wales, IMVT Corporation, a Delaware corporation based in the U.S., and Immunovant Sciences GmbH (“ISG”), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Switzerland. ISG holds all of the Company’s intellectual property rights. 
[B] Liquidity
The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled

$
714.0
 million
 and its accumulated deficit was 
$
1,239.5
 million
.
The Company has not generated any revenues to date and does not anticipate generating any revenues unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for IMVT-1402, batoclimab or any future product candidate. Management expects to incur additional losses in the future to fund its operations and conduct product research and development and recognizes the need to raise additional capital to fully implement its business plan.
The Company intends to raise such additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, debt financings or other sources in order to further implement its business plan. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company will need to reevaluate its operating plan and may be required to delay the development of its product candidates.
Note 2 — 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
[A] 
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31, and its first three fiscal quarters end on June 30, September 30, and December 31. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company has no unconsolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

124
Table of Contents
[B] 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to assets, liabilities, stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, clinical trial accruals, operating leases, research and development costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Additionally, the Company assessed the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors on its operations and financial results as of March 31, 2025 and through the issuance of this report. The Company’s analysis was informed by the facts and circumstances as they were known to the Company. This assessment considered the impact that these uncertainties may have on financial estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses.
[C] 
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company is subject to risks common to early-stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to clinical effectiveness of products, commercialization of products, regulatory approvals, dependence on key products, key personnel and third-party service providers such as contract research organizations (“CROs”), protection of intellectual property rights, the need and ability to obtain additional financing and the ability to make milestone, royalty or other payments due under any license, collaboration or supply agreements.
[D] 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2025, the cash and cash equivalents balance is kept in banking institutions that the Company believes are of high credit quality and are in excess of federally insured levels. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.
[E] 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $
687.6
 million and
 $
607.7

million, respectively, of money market funds invested in high-quality, short-term securities that are issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government and its agencies that are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices.
[F] 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment, consisting of computers, is recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed to operations as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
three years
. Upon disposal, retirement or sale, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations.
[G] 
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as right-of-use assets due to operating leases, property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

Contingencies
The Company, from time to time, has been and may be a party to various disputes and claims arising from normal business activities. The Company continually assesses litigation to determine if an unfavorable outcome would lead to a probable loss or reasonably possible loss which could be estimated. The Company accrues for all contingencies at the earliest date at which the Company deems it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the Company accrues the minimum of the range. In the cases where the Company believes that a reasonably possible loss exists, the Company discloses the facts and circumstances of the litigation, including an estimable range, if possible. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. Additionally, the Company records a receivable for rights to insurance recoveries, limited to the extent of incurred or probable losses, when such recoveries have been agreed to with third-party insurers and when receipt is deemed probable. This includes instances when the third-party insurers have agreed to pay, on the Company’s behalf, certain legal defense costs and settlement amounts directly to applicable law firms and settlement funds.

[I] 
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities (including manufacturing) on behalf of the Company. The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by CROs. In making these estimates, the Company considers various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment. The Company accrues costs for non-clinical studies and contract manufacturing activities over the service periods specified in the contracts and are adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. The estimate of the work completed is developed through discussions with internal personnel and external services providers as to the progress toward completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. As actual costs become known, the accrued estimates are adjusted. Such estimates are not expected to be materially different from amounts actually incurred.
The Company participates in cost-sharing arrangements with third parties whereby the third parties have agreed to share a portion of the costs incurred by the Company, related to batoclimab drug manufacturing and clinical trials. The Company records the third parties’ share of the costs as a reduction of research and development expenses and an increase to accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on actual amounts incurred by the Company and billable to the third parties. These cost-sharing arrangements do not contemplate any future revenue-generating activity or global commercialization efforts of batoclimab benefiting any of the parties.
[J] 
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) expenses include payments made or due in connection with license agreements upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. 
The Company evaluates in-licensed agreements for IPR&D projects to determine if any such in-licensed agreement meets the definition of a business and thus should be accounted for as a business combination. If the in-licensed agreement for IPR&D does not meet the definition of a business and the assets have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use, the Company expenses payments made under such license agreements as acquired in-process research and development expenses in its consolidated statements of operations. Payments for milestones achieved and payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred. Payments made in connection with regulatory and sales-based milestones will be capitalized and amortized to cost of product sales over the remaining useful life of the asset.

[K] 
Leases
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future fixed lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement date calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease asset, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. Operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease commencement, adjusted by any initial direct costs and exclude any lease incentives received. The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancelable period of the lease and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs such as common area costs and other operating costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its leases.
[L] 
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax (benefit) expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in provision for income taxes.
[M] 
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based awards to employees and directors are valued at fair value on the date of the grant and that fair value is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards with graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The Company values its stock options that only have service vesting requirements using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation related to restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. When determining the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards, management further considers whether an adjustment is required to the observable market price or volatility of the Company’s common stock that is used in the valuation as a result of material non-public information, if that information is expected to result in a material increase in share price.
Certain assumptions need to be made with respect to utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, including the expected life of the award, volatility of the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and the fair value of the Company’s common stock. Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the “simplified method” with the continued use of this method extended until such time as the Company has sufficient exercise history. In prior fiscal years, because the Company did not have sufficient trading history to rely on the volatility of its common stock, volatility was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for comparable publicly traded peer companies. Beginning on April 1, 2024, the Company determined that its common stock had sufficient trading activity to utilize company-specific trading data within the assumption of volatility of the underlying shares. The expected share price volatility for the Company’s common stock is estimated using a weighted blend of the Company’s historical price volatility and

the average historical price volatility for comparable publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the equity award. 
As the Company has never paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
. The Company accounts for pre-vesting award forfeitures when they occur.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company applies a fair value framework in order to measure and disclose its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves.
•
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is gr
eatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and amounts due to 
Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“
RSL”). These financial instruments are stated at their respective historical carrying amounts, which approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
 There were no Level 2 or Level 3 financial instruments as of March 31, 2025 or 2024.
[O] 
Foreign Currency
The Company has operations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Bermuda, and Switzerland. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based functional currency operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. The Company’s assets and liabilities are translated using the current exchange rate as of the consolidated balance sheet date and equity is translated using historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company’s foreign functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net loss and are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
[P] 
Net Loss per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the diluted weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss, all common stock equivalents are deemed anti-dilutive such that basic net loss per common share and diluted net loss per common share are equivalent. Potentially dilutive common stock has been excluded from the diluted net loss per common share computations in all periods presented because such securities have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per common share due to the Company’s net loss. There are no reconciling items used to calculate the weighted-average number of total common stock outstanding for basic and diluted net loss per common share data.
The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive effect:

As of March 31, 2025, the Company has gross net operating loss carryforwards in the following jurisdictions: Switzerland of approximately $
1,094.6
 million, which will begin to expire as of March 31, 2027, the United Kingdom of approximately $
0.9
 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with an annual usage limitation, and the U.S. of approximately $
48.7
 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of future taxable income for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The Company has research and development and orphan drug credit carryforwards in the U.S. of approximately $
39.2
 million, which begin to expire as of March 31, 2039.
The Company assesses the realizability of its net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date based on available positive and negative evidence in order to determine the amount which is more likely than not to be realized and record a valuation allowance as necessary. Due to the Company’s cumulative loss position which provides significant negative evidence difficult to overcome, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $
218.8
 million and $
141.5
 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, representing the portion of the net deferred tax assets that is not expected to be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted for future factors that would impact the assessment of the objective and subjective evidence of the Company. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date in order to determine the proper amount, if any, required for a valuation allowance.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company does not have undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws or the Company’s financial situation could result in a change to the Company’s position.
The Company is subject to tax and files income tax returns in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions. The Company’s tax periods for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 through March 31, 2025 remain open for tax examinations in most applicable income tax jurisdictions. Tax audits and examinations can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments. The resolution of matters may span multiple years particularly if subject to litigation or negotiation. The Company believes it has appropriately recorded its tax position using reasonable estimates and assumptions, however the potential tax benefits may impact the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period of resolution, settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefit activity during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and related liabilities were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2025 and 2024. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Series A Preferred Stock
As of March 31, 2025, 
10,000
 shares of Series A preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, were outstanding and held by RSL.
The holder(s) of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A preferred stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter, and do not have cumulative voting rights.
The holder(s) of a majority of outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, exclusively and as a separate class, are entitled to elect: (i) four Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 
50
% or more of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, (ii) three Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 
40
% or more but less than 
50
% of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, and (iii) two Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 
25
% or more but less than

Each share of Series A preferred stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into 
one
 share of common stock. On any transfer of shares of Series A preferred stock, whether or not for value, each such transferred share will automatically convert into 
one
 share of common stock, except for certain transfers described in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Each share of Series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 
one
 share of common stock at such time as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold less than 
25
% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding shares.
The Company shall not, without the consent of the holder(s) of at least a majority of Series A preferred stock, alter or repeal any provisions of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affect the powers, preferences or rights of the Series A preferred stock.
In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holder(s) of the Series A preferred stock will receive first an amount per share equal to $
0.01
 and then will be entitled to share ratably in the assets legally available for distribution to all stockholders.

In January 2025, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company issued 
22,500,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, to certain institutional accredited investors (including

 shares of common stock to RSL), at a price of $
20.00
 per share in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The gross proceeds to the Company were approximately $
450.0
 million. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement with certain of the investors, the Company subsequently filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement to its registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275419), which automatically became effective upon its filing on November 9, 2023, covering the resale of 
5,654,990
 shares of common stock issued in the private placement. The Company has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to keep such registration statement effective until the date the shares described above have been sold or may be resold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without restriction.
In November 2023, the Company entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (“Leerink Partners”), as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock (the “ATM Shares”), subject to certain conditions as specified in the sales agreement. The Company agreed to pay Leerink Partners up to 
3
% of the gross proceeds from each sale of ATM Shares sold through the sale agreement. The ATM Shares would be sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale and, as a result, prices may vary. The ATM Shares to be sold under the sales agreement, if any, would be issued and sold pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which the Company filed with the SEC in November 2023, along with a prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of up to $
150.0
 million of ATM Shares pursuant to the sales agreement. The Company has not issued or sold any ATM Shares pursuant to the ATM offering program.

1,105,500
 additional shares of common stock) at a price to the public of $
38.00
 per share. Concurrent with the public offering, RSL purchased 
4,473,684
 shares of the Company’s common stock in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act at the same price per share as investors in the public offering. The net proceeds to the Company were $

Stock-Based Compensation
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
In December 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) and reserved 
5,500,000
 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under t
he 2019 Plan will automatically increase on April 1 of each year, continuing through April 1, 2029, by 
4.0
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding month, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2019 Plan is 
16,500,000
. The Company’s employees, directors and consultants are eligible to receive non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other stock awards and performance awards under the plan. Generally, each option will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and a 
ten-year
 contractual term. For grants of incentive stock options, if the grantee owns, or is deemed to own, 
10
% or more of the total voting power of the Company, then the exercise price shall be 
110
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and the option will have a 
five-year
 contractual term. Stock options that are forfeited, cancelled or have expired are available for future grants. 
On 
April 1, 2024, 
5,823,319
 shares o
f common stock were added to the 2019 Plan pool in accordance with the 
4.0
% evergreen provision of the 2019 Plan. As of March 31, 2025, options to purchase 
10,357,061
 shares of common stock and

 shares of common stock remained available for future grant under the 2019 Plan.
2018 Equity Incentive Plan
As of the effective date of the 2019 Plan, no further stock awards have been or will be made under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). As of March 31, 2025, options to purchase 
2,606,773
 shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2018 Plan. 
2023 Inducement Plan
On February 1, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved the adoption of the 2023 Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan”), which is to be used exclusively for grants of awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company (or following a bona fide period of non-employment) as a material inducement to such individuals’ entry into employment with the Company, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The Company has reserved 
5,000,000
 shares of its common stock that may be issued under the Inducement Plan. The terms and conditions of the Inducement Plan are substantially similar to those of the 2019 Plan. As of March 31, 2025,

Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnification Agreements
The Company is a party to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that contain typical provisions that obligate the Company to indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. The aggregate maximum potential future liability of the Company under such indemnification provisions is uncertain. The Company also indemnifies each of its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company currently holds director and officer liability insurance. 
139
Table of Contents
Litigation
The Company may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business. The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is probable and estimable. As of March 31, 2025, the Company was not party to any material legal proceedings and thus no contingent liabilities were recorded.
Commitments
During the year ended 
March 31, 2022
, ISG entered into the PSA with Samsung to manufacture a certain quantity of batoclimab drug substance for, among other things, commercial sale, if approved. As of March 31, 2025, in connection with this agreement, the Company has a remaining minimum obligation to Samsung of approximately $
43.6
 million, of which $
5.5
 million, $
10.1
 million, $
14.0
 million and 
$
14.0

million is expected to be paid during the fiscal years ending March 31, 2026, 2028, 
2029
 and 
2030, 
respectively. During the years ended March 31, 2025, 
2024 and 2023
, the Company recorded 
$
3.5
 million, 
$
2.3
 million and 
$
19.8
 million, respectively, of research and development expenses related to the PSA. The Company made cash payments of 
$
2.8
 million related to the minimum obligations under the PSA during the year ended March 31, 2025 and recorded 
$
4.9
 million in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2025. See Note 3 - Material Agreements for additional details.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company did not have any other ongoing material contractual obligations for which cash flows were fixed and determinable. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for nonclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes, which agreements are generally cancellable by the Company at any time, subject to payment of remaining obligations under binding purchase orders and, in certain cases, nominal early-termination fees. These commitments are not deemed significant. There are certain contracts wherein the Company has a minimum purchase commitment, however, most of it is due and payable within 
one year
.
Contingencies
The extent of the impact of geopolitical tensions, changes in inflation and interest rates, changes in international trade policies and tariffs and any resulting economic slowdown or recession on the Company’s future operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the potential impact on the Company’s clinical trial plans and timelines, such as the enrollment, activation and initiation of additional clinical trial sites and the results of the Company’s clinical trials, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which these events may impact the Company’s future financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025 at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on management’s assessment, management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Immunovant, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Immunovant, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Immunovant, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated May 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
