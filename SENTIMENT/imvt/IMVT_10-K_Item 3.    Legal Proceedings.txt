Overview
Immunovant is a clinical-stage immunology company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. Our focus is on developing IMVT-1402, a potentially best-in-class inhibitor of the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (“FcRn”), to address autoimmune diseases driven by high levels of pathogenic immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibodies. FcRn is involved in preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies, and inhibition of FcRn has been shown to reduce levels of total IgG and pathogenic IgG antibodies. 
We believe that FcRn inhibition has broad therapeutic and commercial potential to address IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases in several therapeutic areas, including but not limited to, endocrinology, neurology, rheumatology and dermatology. Third-party estimates suggest over four million patients in the United States and Europe could benefit from anti-FcRn treatments across more than 20 indications currently being evaluated in clinical trials by multiple companies, with two indications that are already approved and launched quickly reaching billions of dollars in sales.
In a Phase 1 clinical trial, healthy adults dosed with IMVT-1402 showed deep, dose-dependent IgG reductions. We expect to be able to reach approximately 80% IgG reductions with continued weekly dosing of 600 mg of IMVT-1402, offering deeper IgG reductions than observed with other competitor anti-FcRn programs. There has been consistent evidence observed across the class in eight indications in Phase 2 and 3 trials with FcRn inhibitors that deeper IgG reductions correlate with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes. This has also been validated with Immunovant’s own Phase 2 and 3 studies evaluating its first-generation anti-FcRn antibody, batoclimab, formerly referred to as IMVT-1401, in Graves’ disease (“GD”), myasthenia gravis (“MG”) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”) which showed that IgG reductions of greater than or equal to 70% led to meaningfully better outcomes compared to reductions below 70% across a range of clinical measures.
In the Phase 1 clinical trial, across all evaluated doses, IMVT-1402 demonstrated no or minimal reductions in albumin and no or minimal increases in LDL cholesterol levels, which are off-target effects observed in some anti-FcRn antibodies, including batoclimab. We are pursuing the rapid development of IMVT-1402 because of its best-in-class potential, with the 600 mg dose expected to reach approximately 80% IgG reduction. We believe IMVT-1402’s profile has the potential to offer best-in-class efficacy, in addition to its potentially favorable safety profile and convenient administration with a simple self-administered auto-injector expected at launch. As previously disclosed, we will make a final decision about future development and regulatory submissions for batoclimab in the future based on the aggregate information available at the time.
We are currently progressing a broad set of programs for IMVT-1402. Over the last fiscal year, we announced the clearance of six investigational new drug (“IND”) applications to support clinical trials to evaluate IMVT-1402. We have initiated studies in five indications, including potentially registrational trials in GD, difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (“D2T RA”), MG and CIDP, and a proof-of-concept trial in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (“CLE”). We also plan to initiate a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in Sjögren’s disease (“SjD”) and a second potentially registrational trial in GD in the summer of 2025. Our primary focus is to execute these six indications first, with plans to assess new indications in the future. All studies evaluating IMVT-1402 are being conducted using the intended commercial drug formulation and delivery device, the YpsoMate® autoinjector developed by Ypsomed AG, which is utilized for multiple approved products.

Data and insights from batoclimab, including our operational trial experience, relationships with investigators and prior results, are being leveraged to inform and potentially accelerate our development programs for IMVT-1402. In March 2025, we announced top-line results of our Phase 3 study of batoclimab in MG, which met its primary endpoint of change in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (“MG-ADL”) score from baseline in acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (“AChR+”) patients. The 680 mg dose set a new benchmark for magnitude of benefit with a 5.6 point mean improvement and 93% MG-ADL response rate. Batoclimab demonstrated strong durability of Minimal Symptom Expression (MG-ADL = 0 or 1) (“MSE”) with 75% of patients who achieved MSE on 680 mg dose by week 6 maintaining MSE status for ≥ 6 weeks. On the same day, we also announced the initial results from period 1 of the Phase 2b study of batoclimab in CIDP following standard of care washout, which demonstrated a mean improvement in the adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment (“aINCAT”) disability score of 1.8 across batoclimab arms and an 84% responder rate in those patients who achieved an IgG lowering greater than or equal to 70%. In both batoclimab studies, deeper IgG reductions correlated with better clinical outcomes across a range of assessments and timepoints. IMVT-1402 600 mg dosing was observed in its Phase 1 trial to have similarly deep IgG reductions to batoclimab 680 mg dosing, supporting IMVT-1402 development in these indications, without the albumin and LDL side effects observed with batoclimab. To add to the strong data sets we have previously reported with batoclimab in GD and TED, we expect to report six-month remission data in GD this summer and Phase 3 TED data in the second half of calendar year 2025.
IMVT-1402 and batoclimab are fully human monoclonal antibodies that target the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (“FcRn”). These antibodies are the result of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted in collaboration with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd., (“HanAll”) to design highly potent anti-FcRn antibodies that may be optimized as a simple, subcutaneous injection with dosing that has been shown to deliver better efficacy at the high dose and similar efficacy at the low dose compared to standard FcRn inhibition by competitors.

Batoclimab Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Trial in GD
In December 2023 and September 2024, we announced results from a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT05907668) of batoclimab for the treatment of uncontrolled GD, which enrolled subjects who were hyperthyroid despite ATD therapy. This study represents the first evaluation of an FcRn inhibitor as a potential treatment for GD. 
Participants in the trial received 12 weeks of high dose batoclimab, 680 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection (“SC”), followed by 12 weeks of lower dose batoclimab, 340 mg weekly SC. At the end of the first 12 weeks, a mean IgG reduction of 77% and a 76% response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (“ULN”) without increasing the ATD dose) were observed. Also, 56% of subjects treated with higher dose batoclimab achieved an ATD-Free Response (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and the patient simultaneously tapering completely off their ATD) at the end of the first 12 weeks. During weeks 13 to 24, lower 340 mg dose batoclimab resulted in mean IgG reduction of 65% with a correspondingly lower responder rate of 68% and a lower ATD-Free Response rate of 36% at the end of the second 12 weeks. Patients who achieved at least a 70% IgG reduction at the end of the evaluation period had nearly a threefold higher ATD-Free Response rate than those who did not (60% vs. 23%). Additional data for certain thyroidal and extrathyroidal manifestations of GD showed a 60% response rate achieved by week 2, demonstrating the rapidity of response to weekly higher dose batoclimab. Improvements in proptosis and lid aperture were also observed at both week 12 and week 24. Batoclimab was generally well tolerated with no new safety signals observed. This clinical trial is ongoing, with additional data expected in the summer of calendar year 2025, including remission data from the 24-week post-treatment follow-up period.
IMVT-1402 Potentially Registrational Trials in GD
We initiated a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in adults with GD in December 2024. This Phase 2b study (NCT06727604) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in Graves’ patients who are hyperthyroid despite treatment with an ATD for 12 or more weeks prior to beginning the study. The study is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants randomized (1:1:1) to one of two blinded treatment groups each receiving IMVT-1402, 600 mg weekly SC, or a matched placebo group. Participants will be evaluated over two consecutive 26-week blinded treatment periods. Over the course of the treatment periods, background ATD treatment will be titrated to the lowest effective dose, including elimination of ATD treatment, to maintain normal thyroid lab values. Following the initial 26-week period, participants in the IMVT-1402 treatment group 2 will be assigned to either continued treatment with IMVT-1402 at the same dose or matching placebo for the second 26-week study period based on the participant’s thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor autoantibodies (“TRAb”) value and euthyroid status determined at week 26. The study’s primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who are euthyroid and off ATD at study week 26. A key secondary endpoint will measure the proportion of participants who become euthyroid and stop ATD treatment at week 52. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in 2027.

In the summer of 2025, we plan to initiate a second potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in adults with GD. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 26-week trial in Graves’ patients who are hyperthyroid despite treatment with an ATD for 12 or more weeks prior to beginning the study. The study is expected to enroll approximately 210 participants randomized (1:1:1) to one of three blinded treatment groups receiving IMVT-1402 600 mg weekly SC, IMVT-1402 300 mg weekly SC, or matched placebo group. Over the course of the treatment periods, background ATD treatment will be titrated to the lowest effective dose, including elimination of ATD treatment, to maintain normal thyroid lab values. The study’s primary endpoint is the proportion of participants in the 600 mg weekly SC dose group who are euthyroid and are off ATD versus placebo at study week 26. A key secondary endpoint will measure the proportion of participants in the 600 mg weekly SC dose group who have T3 (Total T3 or FT3) and FT4 ≤ULN and are off ATD versus placebo.
Batoclimab Phase 3 Clinical Program in TED
In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we initiated our Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate batoclimab as a treatment for active moderate-to-severe TED. We plan to report top-line results from this clinical trial in the second half of calendar year 2025.

Batoclimab Phase 3 Trial in MG
In March 2025, we announced top-line results from a randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (NCT05403541) to assess the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in adults with MG. Following screening, participants with moderate to severe MG were randomized into Period 1 where they received high dose batoclimab (680 mg) or low dose batoclimab (340 mg) or placebo weekly SC for 12 weeks. Responders to batoclimab in Period 1, defined in the protocol as ≥ 2-point improvement in the MG-ADL score from baseline, were re-randomized 1:1:1 to batoclimab (340 mg SC weekly or 340 mg SC every other week) or placebo weekly SC for 12 weeks (Period 2). The primary endpoint of the study was mean change from baseline in MG-ADL in AChR+ participants at week 12 (end of Period 1). 
Batoclimab met its primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in MG-ADL in AChR+ participants. Among the AChR+ population, participants randomized to 680 mg of batoclimab administered weekly SC (“QW”) achieved a 5.6 point mean improvement in MG-ADL at week 12 (n=57; p < 0.001), while those randomized to 340 mg of batoclimab QW achieved a 4.7 point mean improvement (n=52; p < 0.05) and those randomized to placebo demonstrated a 3.6 point mean improvement (n=55; p < 0.05). 93% of AChR+ participants receiving batoclimab 680 mg QW achieved an MG-ADL response at week 12. Subjects in the 680 mg batoclimab treatment arm showed a mean reduction in IgG levels of 74% vs. 64% in the 340 mg batoclimab arm. 42% of the AChR+ subjects treated with batoclimab 680 mg QW achieved MSE, defined as having an MG-ADL score of 0 or 1 at week 12. Of those subjects that achieved MSE prior to or by week 6, 75% maintained their MSE status for ≥ 6 weeks. Safety and tolerability were observed to be consistent with prior batoclimab studies. 
We are planning to leverage the data and learnings from the batoclimab MG study, including our operational trial experience, relationships with investigators and prior results, to inform and accelerate our program with IMVT-1402.
IMVT-1402 Potentially Registrational Trial in MG
We initiated a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in adults with MG in March 2025. This Phase 3 trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 26-week trial. This study is expected to enroll approximately 230 participants randomized (1:1:1) to one of three blinded treatment groups receiving IMVT-1402 600 mg weekly SC, IMVT-1402 300 mg weekly SC, or matched placebo group for the 12-week induction period. Participants on treatment will continue to be on the same treatment for the 14-week maintenance period, while patients on placebo will receive IMVT-1402 600 mg weekly SC. The study’s primary endpoint is the change in MG-ADL from baseline at week 12. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in 2027.

Batoclimab Phase 2b Trial in CIDP
In March 2025, we announced initial results from Period 1 of the randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in adult patients with active CIDP (NCT05581199). To ensure the enrollment of patients with active CIDP, the trial design incorporates inclusion criteria tied to active disease and a formal adjudication committee, as well as a washout phase during which participants must worsen by at least 1 point on the aINCAT disability scale to remain in the trial. Period 1 was a non-placebo controlled 12-week run-in period, during which participants whose disease had worsened during standard of care washout then received either 340 mg or 680 mg batoclimab QW SC. 
Combined data for 73 patients (both dose cohorts of Period 1) demonstrated a 1.8-point improvement in aINCAT disability score (compared to Period 1 baseline) at week 12. An 84% responder rate (with response defined as an aINCAT score improvement ≥ 1) was observed among all patients whose level of IgG was reduced by ≥ 70% as compared to 44% among patients with < 70% IgG reductions. Other CIDP scales also demonstrated meaningful improvements for the pooled dose cohorts at week 12. The study remains blinded and is ongoing. No new safety signals were observed. 
We are planning to leverage the data and learnings from the batoclimab CIDP study, including our operational trial experience, relationships with investigators and prior results, to inform and accelerate our program with IMVT-1402.
IMVT-1402 Potentially Registrational Trial in CIDP
We initiated a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in adults with CIDP in March 2025. This Phase 2b trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week trial in CIDP patients. The study is expected to enroll approximately 162 participants randomized (2:1) to one either receiving IMVT-1402 600 mg weekly SC, or matched placebo for the 24-week treatment period. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate the proportion of participants remaining relapse free (aINCAT) at week 24. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in 2028.
Rheumatology Diseases
IMVT-1402 Potentially Registrational Trial in D2T RA
We initiated a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in ACPA-positive D2T RA in December 2024. This trial (NCT06754462) is expected to enroll approximately 120 participants into an initial 16-week open-label, active treatment period. To ensure the enrollment of patients with active D2T RA, the trial inclusion criteria require elevated ACPA levels and prior inadequate response to two or three (but no more than three) classes of biologics or targeted synthetic DMARDs. The study will evaluate IMVT-1402’s 600 mg weekly SC during the open-label induction phase of the trial with the intent of maximizing reduction in ACPA levels. Participants achieving a response at weeks 14 and 16 per the American College of Rheumatology response criteria 20 (“ACR20”) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment with either IMVT-1402 600 mg, IMVT-1402 300 mg or placebo, weekly SC for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint will assess the proportion of such participants who maintain the ACR20 response at week 28. Eligible participants who complete week 28 will have the option to receive IMVT-1402 for an additional period of 48 weeks as part of a long-term extension period. We expect to report initial results from the period 1 open label portion of this trial in 2026.
IMVT-1402 Potentially Registrational Trial in SjD
We plan to initiate a potentially registrational trial evaluating IMVT-1402 in SjD in the summer of 2025. This trial (NCT06979531) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IMVT-1402 in adult participants with moderate to severe systemic primary SjD. The trial is anticipated to enroll approximately 180 participants randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive IMVT-1402 600 mg, IMVT-1402 300 mg or placebo weekly SC for two 24-week blinded treatment periods. The primary endpoint will assess the efficacy of IMVT-1402 compared to placebo as assessed by ClinESSDAI score at week 24. Participants assessed as responders at week 24, defined as participants that show an improvement of  ≥ 4 points from baseline ClinESSDAI score, will continue on treatment for a second 24-week period. A key secondary endpoint will assess change from baseline in ClinESSDAI score at week 48. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in 2028.

IMVT-1402 Proof-of-Concept Trial in CLE
We initiated a proof-of-concept trial of IMVT-1402 in CLE in February 2025. This Phase 2b trial (NCT06980805) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IMVT-1402 in participants with active SCLE and/or CCLE with or without systemic manifestations. This trial is anticipated to enroll approximately 56 participants randomized 1:1 to IMVT-1402 600 mg QW SC or placebo QW SC for 12 weeks during Period 1. Participants who complete Period 1 will enter Period 2, during which all participants will receive IMVT-1402 600 mg QW SC for 14 weeks. After completion of Period 2, participants will be rerandomized 1:1 to blinded IMVT-1402 300 mg or 600 mg SC QW for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint will evaluate the efficacy of IMVT-1402 compared to placebo based on percent change from Period 1 baseline in CLASI-A score at week 12. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in 2026.
