during any fifteen-day period or (ii) twice during any calendar month)) by the delivery to the Administrative Agent, each Funding Agent, each Conduit Lender and the Paying Agent, not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on a date that is at least five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of a Borrowing Date that occurs on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, two (2) Business Days) prior to the proposed Borrowing Date of a written notice of such request substantially in the form of 
Exhibit B-2
 attached hereto (each such notice, a 
“Notice of Borrowing”
).  Such Notice of Borrowing shall be accompanied by a duly completed Borrowing Base Certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower unless the proposed Borrowing Date is more than five (5) Business Days after the date of such Notice of Borrowing, in which case Borrower shall deliver such Borrowing Base Certificate on the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date. Any Notice of Borrowing or Borrowing Base Certificate received by the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents, the Conduit Lenders or the Paying Agent after the time specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day, and to the extent that results in the proposed Borrowing Date being earlier than five (5) Business Days after the date of delivery of such Notice of Borrowing, then the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing as the proposed Borrowing Date of an Advance shall be deemed to be the Business Day immediately succeeding the proposed Borrowing Date of such Advance specified in such Notice of Borrowing.  The proposed Borrowing Date specified in a Notice of Borrowing shall be no earlier than five (5) Business Days, and no later than thirty (30) days, after the date of delivery of such Notice of Borrowing.  Unless otherwise provided herein, each Notice of Borrowing may not be revoked; 
provided
, that the only consequence for the failure of the Borrower to borrow Advances on a Borrowing Date shall be its obligation to pay Breakage Costs as provided in 
Section 2.12(A)
.  For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Borrower to borrow Advances on a Borrowing Date shall count against the caps on the number of requested Advances set forth in the first sentence of this 
Section 2.4
.  The aggregate principal amount of the Advances requested by the Borrower for any Borrowing Date shall not be less than the lower of (x) $2,500,000 and any multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and (y) the remaining amount necessary in order for the Borrower to borrow the maximum aggregate amount of Advances then permitted under 
Section 3.2(A)(vii)
. 
(B)
The Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Advances and the amount of such Advances allocated to each Lender Group based on its Lender Group Percentage and (ii) the proposed Borrowing Date.
(C)
With respect to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date, each Lender (or the related Funding Agent on behalf of the related Lenders in its Lender Group) shall remit the amount of its Advance to the Funding Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Borrowing Date.  The Paying Agent shall receive and hold such Advances in the Funding Account in escrow for the benefit of the Lenders.  Upon a determination by the Administrative Agent that all conditions precedent to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date set forth in Article III have been satisfied or otherwise waived, the Administrative Agent shall direct the Paying Agent to distribute the Advances to be made on any such any Borrowing Date in accordance with the Borrower’s written instructions provided in the related Notice of Borrowing.
(D)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, with respect to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date, each of the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent are obligated only to perform their respective duties specifically set forth in 
Section 2.4(C)
 or otherwise in the related Notice of Borrowing, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature. Under no circumstance will the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent be deemed to be a fiduciary to any Person with respect to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date or the Administrative Agent’s or the Paying 
3
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
Agent’s duties under 
Section 2.4(C)
 or the related Notice of Borrowing. With respect to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other than 
Section 2.4(C)
 and the related Notice of Borrowing, whether or not an original or a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent; and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Paying Agent shall have any duty to know or inquire as to the performance or nonperformance of any provision of any such agreement, instrument, or document. With respect to the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Paying Agent will be responsible to determine or to make inquiry into any term, capitalized, or otherwise, not defined herein.  
Section 2.4(C)
 and the related Notice of Borrowing set forth all matters pertinent to the escrow of the Advances to be made on any Borrowing Date contemplated hereunder, and no additional obligations of the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent with respect thereto shall be inferred or implied from the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.
(E)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Borrower has delivered a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.4, any Lender that is incorporated in Canada (but not including any non-Canadian incorporated bank with a branch located in Canada) that has incurred charges (“
Basel III Charges
”) (which may include external charges incurred by such Lender or internal charges incurred by any business of such Lender as a result of related external charges incurred by such Lender) based on the “liquidity coverage ratio” under the proposals for risk-based capital framework described by the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices commonly known as Basel III, as amended, modified and supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement thereof (“
Basel III
”), or would incur Basel III Charges as of the relevant Borrowing Date, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Advance funded hereunder by such Lender, by delivering a written notice (the “
Delayed Funding Notice
”) to the Borrower one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, such Lender may elect to delay the funding of its portion of the Advance by a period of up to 35 days; provided that only a Lender that is subject to the “liquidity coverage ratio” regulations under Basel III may deliver a Delayed Funding Notice. Each Delayed Funding Notice shall indicate (x) the portion of such Lender’s share of the requested Advance which will be subject to a delay (a “
Delayed Amount
”) and (y) the date (which, if such date is not a Business Day, then on the next succeeding Business Day) such delayed amount will be funded by such Lender (in respect of a Delayed Amount, the “
Delayed Drawing Date
”). Any Delayed Funding Notice shall be deemed a representation by the applicable Lender that it has incurred Basel III Charges in the respect of this Agreement or any Advance held by it hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event a Lender elects to delay funding a portion of its share of an Advance in accordance with this Section 2.4(E), the Borrower shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent that such Lender will not be funding such portion of such Advance on the relevant requested Borrowing Date and that the relevant Delayed Amount will be deducted from the total amount of the requested Advance and (ii) offer the right to fund such Lender’s requested portion of such Advance to the other Lenders (so long as within their Unused Portion of the Commitments) prior to the Borrower funding (or cause to be funded) to itself, by way of an equity contribution, such Delayed Amount on the relevant requested Borrowing Date. In the event a Lender elects to delay funding a portion of its share of an Advance in accordance with this Section 2.4(E), such Lender’s share of the 
4
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
Unused Line Fees shall not accrue until such time as such Delayed Amount is funded by such Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Borrower, any Affiliate of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Custodian, the Securities Intermediary nor any other Lender shall be required to fund the relevant Delayed Amount to the Borrower on the relevant requested Borrowing Date. On the Delayed Drawing Date, the relevant Lender shall make available the Delayed Amount either (i) to the extent the Borrower funded the Delayed Amount by way of an equity contribution, to the Borrower by wire transferring the Delayed Amount, in immediately available funds, to an account of the Borrower as the Borrower may from time to time prior to the Delayed Drawing Date notify such Lender for such purpose, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Borrower shall be permitted to transfer such Delayed Amount to Sunrun as reimbursement to the extent such Delayed Amount was funded by Sunrun to the Borrower on the Borrowing Date by way of an equity contribution or (ii) to the extent other Lenders funded the Delayed Amount, to such Lenders and such Lenders shall sell and assign at par amounts the advances related to the Delayed Amount to the delaying Lender such that each Lender holds its pro rata share of all Advances outstanding after giving effect to such assignments.

Section 2.9.
Mandatory Prepayments of Advances. 
(A)
If, as of any Borrowing Base Calculation Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances exceeds the lesser of (i) the amount of the Aggregate Commitment in effect as of such date and (ii) the Borrowing Base as of such Borrowing Base Calculation Date (as such Borrowing Base is set forth in the applicable Borrowing Base Certificate delivered with respect to such Borrowing Base Calculation Date) (the occurrence of any such excess being referred to herein as a 
“Borrowing Base Deficiency
”), then except as otherwise provided in 
Section 2.9(C)
 below, the Borrower shall, in accordance with 
Section 2.9(B)
, pay to the Paying Agent for the account of the Lenders (and direct the Paying Agent to pay to the Funding Agents on behalf of the Lenders in their respective Lender Groups) the amount of any such excess (to be applied to the reduction of Advances ratably among all Lender Groups based on their Lender Group Percentages to the extent necessary to cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency), together with accrued but unpaid interest on the amount required to be so prepaid to the date of such prepayment and any Breakage Costs or Liquidation Fees in connection with such prepayment if such prepayment is not made on a Payment Date.  
(B)
Any amounts required to be paid in connection with a Borrowing Base Deficiency pursuant to 
Section 2.9(A)
 shall be due and payable (i) if the applicable Borrowing Base Calculation Date referred to in 
Section 2.9(A)
 is a Payment Date, on such Payment Date or (ii) if the applicable Borrowing Base Calculation Date is not a Payment Date, within two Business Days following the Borrower’s delivery of the Borrowing Base Certificate indicating the existence of such Borrowing Base Deficiency. 
(C)
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in lieu of prepaying Advances to cure a Borrowing Base Deficiency pursuant to 
Section 2.9(A)
, the Borrower may instead cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency (or a portion thereof) by causing additional Eligible Solar Assets to be contributed to a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (through the Borrower) 
11
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
under the applicable Contribution Agreements and/or acquired by a Tax Equity Opco under the related Project Documents, as the case may be, in an aggregate amount sufficient to cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency (or portion thereof), so long as (i) such acquisition occurs on or before the date on which a payment would otherwise be due under 
Section 2.9(B)
, (ii) the Borrower provides written notice to Administrative Agent of such contribution or acquisition, together with a pro forma Borrowing Base Certificate giving effect to such acquisition and (iii) the related Custodian File for such additional Eligible Solar Assets are delivered to the Custodian pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3 of the Custodial Agreement and the Custodian shall have confirmed receipt of such Custodian File pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4(a) of the Custodial Agreement on or before the date such payment is due under 
Section 2.9(B)
.  For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after giving effect to such contribution or acquisition of additional Eligible Solar Assets pursuant to this 
Section 2.9(C)
 and satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified herein, the Borrower shall be obligated to cure such remaining Borrowing Base Deficiency by making the requisite payments with respect thereto in accordance with 
Sections 2.9(A)

If any amounts required to be paid by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents (including principal or interest payable on any Advance, and any fees or other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Funding Agents or a Lender) remain unpaid after such amounts are due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall pay interest on the aggregate, outstanding balance of such overdue amount from the date due until the amounts are paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Cost of Funds Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  The Lenders shall be entitled to such accrued interest in an amount equal to the applicable Interest Distribution Amount payable on each Payment Date in accordance with 
Section 2.7(B)
 and, if applicable, 
Section 2.7(C)
.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any Committed Lender, or any Affiliate of such Committed Lender may, from time to time (but without any obligation) purchase and hold Commercial Paper issued by its related Conduit Lender for its own account, regardless of any difference between the Commercial Paper Rate (expressed as an interest rate per annum) and the then-current Benchmark. Not later than two (2) Business Days after the end of each calendar month, each Conduit Lender that has Advances outstanding that have accrued interest at the Commercial Paper Rate shall provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with a monthly statement detailing the accrued and unpaid interest for such Conduit Lender since the prior Interest Accrual Period;

Section 2.11.
Inability to Determine Rates.  
(A)
Subject to 
Section 2.11(C)
, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Accrual Period for any SOFR Advance:
(i)
the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that “Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or
(ii)
the Majority Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Advance or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Accrual Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Advance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Advance, and the Majority Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
(B)
Subject to 
Section 2.11(C)
, upon delivery of a notice by Administrative Agent to the Borrower under 
Section 2.11(A)
, (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Advances, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Advances or to convert Base Rate Advances to SOFR Advances shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Advances or the affected Interest Accrual Periods) and (ii) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect the calculation of Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute Base Rate, in each case, until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Advances (to the extent of the affected SOFR Advances or the affected Interest Accrual Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Advances will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Accrual Period.  Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted and any additional amounts required pursuant to 
Section 2.12(A)
.
(C)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, 
(i)
Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement.  Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5
th
) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders.  No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this 
Section 2.11(C)(i)
 will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 
(ii)
In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, any amendments implementing such 
13
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

Section 2.11(C)(iv)
.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this 
Section 2.11(C)
, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this 
Section 2.11(C)
.
(iv)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (1) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (y) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Accrual Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative tenor and (2) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (1) above either (x) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (y) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Accrual Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(v)
Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a SOFR Advance of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Base Rate Advance or conversion to Base Rate Advances.  
(vi)
None of the Paying Agent, Collateral Agent, Custodian or Transaction Transition Manager shall be (1) responsible for making any decisions or determinations in connection with any Benchmark Replacement, Conforming Changes or other matters under this 
Section 2.11(C)
, or (2) have any liability for any determination, decision or election made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent (or other similar role) or the Borrower in connection with any Benchmark Replacement or Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be deemed to waive and release any and all claims against the Paying Agent, Collateral Agent, Custodian or Transaction Transition

Manager relating to any such determination, decision or election by the Administrative Agent.
(D)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, if any Lender determines that any Applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Advances whose interest is determined by reference to Term SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or SOFR, or otherwise to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (1) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Advances or to convert Base Rate Advances to SOFR Advances shall be suspended, and (2) the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Advances of such Lender to Base Rate Advances (the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent on the last day of the Interest Accrual Period therefor if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Advances to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Advances).   Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to 
Section 2.12

The Borrower shall not be responsible for any Liquidation Fees or any other loss, cost, or expenses arising at the time of, and arising solely as a result of, any assignment made pursuant to 
Section 10.8
 and the reallocation of any portion of an Advance of the applicable Lender making such assignment unless, in each case, such assignment is requested by the Borrower and the applicable Lender is not a Defaulting Lender.  Except for any Liquidation Fees, all payments and prepayments hereunder shall be made without any penalty or premium.
(B)

(C)
Capital Adequacy.
  If any Change in Law has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of any Affected Party as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or arising in connection herewith to a level below that which any such Affected Party could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration the policies of such Affected Party with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Affected Party to be material, then from time to time, within ten (10) Business Days after written demand by such Affected Party (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for such demand), the Borrower shall pay directly to such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for such reduction in accordance with

, or 
2.12(C)
, any Affected Party is required to compensate a bank or other financial institution providing liquidity support, credit enhancement or other similar support to such Affected Party in connection with this Agreement or the funding or maintenance of Advances hereunder, then within ten (10) Business Days after written demand by such Affected Party, the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as may be necessary to reimburse such Affected Party for any amounts paid by it; 
provided
, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate an Affected Party  pursuant to this 
Section 2.12(D)

provided further
 that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(F)
If the Borrower is required to pay amounts under 
Section 2.12(B)
, 
(C)

provided
, 
however
, that no Lender shall be required to take any such action that, as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, would adversely affect the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Advances or the interests of such Lender; 
provided
, 
further
, 
however
, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on any Lender of any additional costs or expenses, unless the Borrower agrees to pay such additional costs and expenses.
(G)
If (i) the Borrower incurs any liability to a Lender under 
Section 2.12(B)
, (C) or (D) or Section 2.17 or (ii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower, at its sole expense may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender subject to this Section 2.12(G) to assign and delegate, without recourse, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Advances, and Commitments of the Lender being replaced hereunder to an assignee that shall assume all those rights and obligations; 
provided
, 
however
, that (w) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority having valid jurisdiction, (x) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (y) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the replaced Lender in immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding Advances of such Lender plus all fees and other amounts accrued for the account of such Lender hereunder with respect thereto, and (z) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.8(A).
A Lender subject to this Section 2.12(G) shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if (A) prior to any such assignment and delegation the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply, (B) such Lender shall waive its right to claim compensation or payment under Section 2.12 or 2.17, if applicable, or (C) any Potential Default, Event of Default or Early Amortization Event then exists.  
Each party hereto agrees that (a) an assignment required pursuant to this Section 2.12(G) may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (b) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party to such Assignment and Assumption in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided, further that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.
Nothing in this Section 2.12(G) shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.  The Administrative Agent and each 
17

Lender hereby agree to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the assignment of any Defaulting Lender’s interest hereunder.
Section 2.13.
Payments and Computations
.
(A)
General
.  All payments to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower), free and clear of and without condition or deduction (other than with respect to Taxes pursuant to 
Section 2.17
) for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  The Borrower (through the Paying Agent pursuant to 
Sections 2.7(B)
 and
 (C)
 and as otherwise permitted in this Agreement) shall make each payment and prepayment in respect of principal, interest, expenses, indemnities, fees or other Obligations due from the Borrower not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Paying Agent at its address referred to in 
Section 10.3
 or to such account provided by the Paying Agent in immediately available, same-day funds. Payments on Obligations may also be made by application of funds in the Revenue Account as provided in 
Section 2.7(B)
 or application of funds in the Takeout Transaction Account as provided in 
Section 2.7(C)
.  All computations of interest for Advances while such Advances bear interest at the Base Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate (other than with respect to CAFCO, LLC, CHARTA, LLC, CIESCO, LLC and CRC Funding, LLC) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.  All other computations of fees and interest provided hereunder (including all computations of interest for Advances while such Advances bear interest at the Benchmark) shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error; 
provided 
that the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to any Advances of a Conduit Lender shall be determined by such Conduit Lender (and shall be notified by such Conduit Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing by 12:00 pm seven (7) Business Days prior to each Payment Date and 12:00 pm two (2) Business Days prior to each Takeout Transaction, as applicable).  The Borrower agrees that, to the extent there are insufficient funds in the Revenue Account, to make any payment under this clause (A) when due, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Paying Agent all amounts due that remain unpaid. 
(B)
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
.  If any Lender (or Funding Agent on behalf of any Lender in its Lender Group) makes available to the Paying Agent funds for any Advance to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this 
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Paying Agent because the conditions to the applicable Advance set forth in Article III  are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Paying Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender or Funding Agent, as applicable) to such Lender or Funding Agent, as applicable, without interest. 
(C)
Obligations of Lenders Several
.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Advances, and to make payments pursuant to 
Section 2.2
 are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Advance or to make any payment under 
Section 2.2 
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Advance, or to make its payment under 
Section 10.5(B)
. 
18

(D)
 Funding Source
.  Subject to Applicable Law, nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Advance in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Advance in any particular place or manner.
Section 2.14.
Payment on Non-Business Days
.  Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Advances shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.
Section 2.15.
Non-Consenting Lenders
.
(A)
If any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower, at its sole expense may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender subject to this 
Section 2.15
 to assign and delegate, without recourse, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Advances, and Commitments of the Lender being replaced hereunder to an assignee that shall assume all those rights and obligations; 
provided
, 
however
, that (w) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority having valid jurisdiction, (x) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (y) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the replaced Lender in immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding Advances of such Lender plus all fees and other amounts accrued for the account of such Lender hereunder with respect thereto, and (z) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.8(A).
(B)
A Lender subject to this 
Section 2.15
 shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if (i) prior to any such assignment and delegation the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply or (ii) such Lender approves or consents to the waiver or amendment that made such Lender a Non-Consenting Lender.  
(C)
Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this 
Section 2.15
 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party to such Assignment and Assumption in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided, further that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.
(D)
Nothing in this 
Section 2.15
 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Non-Consenting Lender.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the assignment of any Non-Consenting Lender’s interest hereunder.

Section 2.16.
Extension of the Scheduled Commitment Termination Date
.

The Administrative Agent shall respond to such request no later than thirty (30) days following the date of its receipt of such request, indicating whether it is considering such request and preliminary conditions precedent to any extension of the Scheduled Commitment Termination Date as the Administrative Agent determines to include in such response. The Administrative Agent’s failure to respond to a request delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this 
Section 2.16
 shall not be deemed to constitute any agreement by the Administrative Agent to any such extension. The granting of any extension of the Scheduled Commitment Termination Date requested by the Borrower shall be in the mutual discretion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders with the consent of all Lender Groups).
Section 2.17.
Taxes
.
(A)
Defined Terms
.  For purposes of this 
Section 2.17
 the term “applicable Law” includes FATCA.
(B)
Payments Free of Taxes.
  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Transaction Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law.  If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion the Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Withholding Agent, then the Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(C)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. 
 The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of a Funding Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(D)
Indemnification by the Borrower
.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to each Funding Agent), or by a Funding Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(E)
Indemnification by the Lenders. 
 Each Committed Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Funding Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Committed Lender’s Lender Group (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified such Administrative Agent or Funding Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to the failure of such Committed Lender’s Lender 
20
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
Group to comply with the provisions of Section 10.8(D), and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Committed Lender’s Lender Group, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Funding Agent in connection with any Transaction Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Committed Lender by its Funding Agent or the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Committed Lender hereby authorizes its Funding Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Committed Lender or its Lender Group under any Transaction Document or otherwise payable by such Funding Agent to the Committed Lender or its Lender Group from any other source against any amount due to such Funding Agent under this paragraph (E).
(F)
Evidence of Payments
.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to each Funding Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Funding Agent.
(G)
Status of Recipients.
  (i)  Any Recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Transaction Document shall deliver to the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent and the related Funding Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Recipient, if reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or the related Funding Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent as will enable the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent to determine whether or not such Recipient is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (ii)(a), (ii)(b) and (ii)(d) below) shall not be required if in the Recipient’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Recipient to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Recipient.

Exhibit N
 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(c)
any Recipient which is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent and the related Funding Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Recipient becomes a Recipient under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Funding Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

Solely for purposes of this clause (d), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower, the Paying Agent, the Administrative Agent and the related Funding Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(H)

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (I) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (I), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (I) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Section 10.2

 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Paying Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; 
provided

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance.

Payment Recipient
”) that the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding 
clause (B)
) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “

Without limiting immediately preceding 
clause (A)
, each Lender, each other Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or other Secured Party, hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent (or any of their respective Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent (or any of their respective Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent (or any of their respective Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender or other Secured Party, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:

(a) in the case of immediately preceding 
clauses (x)
 or 
(y)
, an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent to the contrary) or (b) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding 
clause (z)
), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and
(ii)
such Lender or other Secured Party shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent pursuant to this 
Section 8.5(B)
.
(C)
Each Lender and each other Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or other Secured Party under any Transaction Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent to such Lender or other Secured Party from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, under immediately preceding 
clause (A)
 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.
(D)
In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, in accordance with immediately preceding 
clause (A)
, from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency
”), upon the Administrative Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “
Erroneous Payment Impacted Advance
”) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Advances (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Advance, the “
Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment
”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Loan Notes evidencing such Advances to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, (ii) the Administrative Agent, as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent, as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.  The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of 
89
[***] = Certain information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both not material and would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.
doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold an Advance (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or other Secured Party under the Transaction Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the “
Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights
”);
 provided
 that the Transaction Parties’ Obligations under the Transaction Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Obligations in respect of Advances that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.
(E)
The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Transaction Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent from the Borrower or any other Transaction Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment; 
provided
 that this 
Section 8.5
 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Transaction Parties relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent. 
(F)
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.
(G)
Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this 
Section 8.5
 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Transaction Document.
(H)
Notwithstanding anything in this 
Section 8.5
 to the contrary, the Paying Agent shall have no obligations or liabilities with respect to determining any Erroneous Payments or enforcing the return of, or any other remedies related to, any Erroneous Payments. The Paying Agent shall make payments to any Funding Agent or other Secured Party in accordance with the Quarterly Transaction Manager Report or such other written direction as is provided to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In the absence of such actual knowledge or receipt of such notice, the Paying Agent and the Collateral Agent may conclusively assume that none of such events have occurred and the Paying Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not have any obligation or duty to determine whether any Event of Default, Early Amortization Event or any other default has occurred. The delivery or availability of reports or other documents to the Paying Agent and the Collateral Agent (including publicly available reports or documents) shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of information contained in or determinable from those reports or documents, except for such information provided to be delivered under this Agreement to the Paying Agent or the Collateral Agent and which the Paying Agent or the Collateral Agent is contractually obligated to review; and knowledge or information acquired by any Responsible Officer of the Paying Agent or the Collateral Agent in any of their respective capacities hereunder or under any other document related to this transaction, provided that the foregoing shall not relieve the Person acting as Paying Agent or as Collateral Agent, as applicable, from its obligations to perform or responsibility for the manner of performance of its duties in a separate capacity under the Transaction Documents.

(including its Commitment, its Loan Notes or its Advances); 
provided
, that each such assignment (A) shall be made pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption, (B) shall be made either (i) to a Permitted Assignee or (ii) to any other Person that is acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless an Event of Default or Early Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing, (C) shall require the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if made during the Availability Period (it being understood that the Borrower shall be deemed to have acted reasonably in withholding, conditioning or delaying any proposed assignment to a Competitor during the Availability Period) unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or Approved Fund or an Event of Default or Early Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing; 
provided
, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof and (D) with respect to any assignment by a Lender in the Atlas Lender Group, such assignment shall require the consent of the Funding Agent within such Lender Group.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; 
provided
, 
however
, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. 
(B)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances in accordance with its Lender Group Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this clause (vi), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
(C)     Upon, and to the extent of, any assignment (unless otherwise stated therein) made by any Lender hereunder, the assignee or purchaser of such assignment shall be a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and shall have all the rights, benefits and obligations (including the obligation to provide documentation pursuant to Section 2.17(G)) of a Lender hereunder.  Each Funding Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a register (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders in its Lender Group, the outstanding principal amounts (and accrued interest) of the Advances owing to each Lender in its Lender Group pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time and any assignment of such outstanding Advances.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be

available for inspection by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(D)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, sell participation interests in its Advances and obligations hereunder (each such recipient of a participation a “Participant”); provided, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower's consent shall be required for a Lender to sell participation interests in its Advances and obligations hereunder to a Competitor; provided, further, that after giving effect to the sale of such participation, such Lender’s obligations hereunder and rights to consent to any waiver hereunder or amendment hereof shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, all amounts payable to such Lender hereunder and all rights to consent to any waiver hereunder or amendment hereof shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation interest, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the other parties hereto shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender and not be obligated to deal with such Participant.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the outstanding principal amounts (and accrued interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Transaction Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Transaction Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Paying Agent shall have responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. Each recipient of a participation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the same rights, benefits and obligations (including the obligation to provide documentation pursuant to Section 2.17(G)) hereunder with respect to the rights and benefits so participated as it would have if it were a Lender hereunder, except that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 or 2.17 than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.
(E)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) a Lender may pledge as collateral, or grant a security interest in, all or any portion of its rights in, to and under this Agreement to a security trustee in connection with the funding by such Lender of Advances without the consent of the Borrower; provided that no such pledge or grant shall release such Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) a Conduit Lender may at any time, without any requirement to obtain the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights (including rights to payment of capital and yield) under this Agreement to a collateral agent or trustee for its commercial paper program.

Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
