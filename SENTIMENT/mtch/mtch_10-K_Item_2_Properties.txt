Item 2. Properties
Match Group believes that the facilities for its management and operations are generally adequate for its current and near-term future needs. Match Group’s facilities, whether owned or leased, are in various cities in the United States and abroad, and generally consist of executive and administrative offices and data centers. We also believe that, if we require additional space, we will be able to lease additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
