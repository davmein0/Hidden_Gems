Overview
We are one of the leading suppliers of replacement and upgrade parts in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, serving passenger cars, light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks, as well as specialty vehicles, including utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). We operate through three business segments: Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and Specialty Vehicle, consistent with the sectors of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry in which we operate. For more information on our segments, refer to Note 8, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8.
As of December 31, 2024, we marketed approximately 138,000 distinct parts compared to approximately 133,000 as of December 31, 2023, many of which we designed and engineered. This number excludes private label stock keeping units and other variations in how we market, package, and distribute our products, includes distinct parts of acquired companies, and reflects distinct parts that have been discontinued at the end of their lifecycle. Our products are sold under our various brand names, under our customers’ private label brands, or in bulk. We are one of the leading aftermarket suppliers of parts that were traditionally available to consumers only from OE manufacturers or salvage yards. These parts include, among other parts, leaf springs, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, oil filters and coolers, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers, driveshafts, UTV windshields, and complex electronics modules.
We generate most of our net sales from customers in North America, primarily in the United States. Our products are sold primarily through aftermarket retailers, including through their online platforms; dealers; national, regional, and local warehouse distributors and specialty markets; and salvage yards. We also distribute aftermarket parts outside the United States, with sales primarily into Canada and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.
We may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers as well as our ability and the ability of our suppliers to deliver products ordered by our customers. The introduction of new products and product lines to customers, as well as business acquisitions, may also cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
Our 2024 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 31, 2024, our 2023 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 31, 2023 and our fiscal 2022 was a 53-week period that ended on December 31, 2022.
Business Performance Summary
Net sales increased 4% to $2,009.2 million in 2024 from $1,929.8 million in 2023. Net income increased 47% to $190.0 million in 2024 from $129.3 million in 2023. Additionally, in 2024 we generated $231.0 million of cash flows from operations, repaid a total of $94.4 million of outstanding debt obligations, and repurchased 865,283 common shares under a share repurchase program for $78.9 million.

New Product Development
New product development is an important success factor for us and has been a source of growth for us. We have made incremental investments to increase our new product development efforts to grow our business and strengthen our relationships with our customers. The investments primarily have been in the form of increased product development resources, increased customer and end-user awareness programs, and customer service improvements. These investments historically have enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow revenues at levels that generally have exceeded market growth rates.
In 2024, we introduced 5,335 new distinct parts to our customers and end-users, including 1,659 “New-to-the-Aftermarket” parts. Please see ITEM 1, “Business – Product Development” for a year-over-year comparison of new product introductions.
One area of focus for the light-duty sector has been our complex electronics program, which capitalizes on the growing number of electronic components being utilized on today’s OE platforms. New vehicles contain an average of approximately 100 electronic modules, with some high-end luxury vehicles exceeding that. Our complex electronics products are designed and developed in-house and tested to help ensure consistent performance, and our product portfolio is focused on further developing our leadership position in this category.
Another area of focus has been on products we market for the heavy-duty sector. We believe that this sector provides many of the same growth opportunities that the light-duty sector has provided us. We specialize in offering parts to this sector that were traditionally only available from OE manufacturers or salvage yards, similar to how we approach the light-duty sector.
Within the specialty vehicle sector, we focus on providing performance parts and accessories and nondiscretionary repair parts for UTVs and ATVs.

We are dedicated to developing better and more innovative materials that will be compatible across a wide variety of makes and models to enhance both the performance and appearance of customers’ vehicles.
Acquisitions
A key component of our strategy is growth through acquisitions. On October 4, 2022, we acquired 
Super ATV, a leading independent supplier to the powersports aftermarket with a family of highly respected brands spanning functional accessories and upgrades, as well as replacement parts for specialty vehicles. 
See Note 2, "Business Acquisitions and Investments", to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8 for additional information. We may acquire businesses in the future to supplement our financial growth, increase our customer base, add to our distribution capabilities, or enhance our product development resources, among other reasons.
Industry Factors
The Company’s financial results are also impacted by various industry factors, including, but not limited to the number, age, and condition of vehicles in operation at any one time, and the miles driven by those vehicles.
Vehicles in Operation
The Company’s products are primarily purchased and installed on a subsegment of the passenger and light-duty vehicles in operation in the United States (“VIO”), specifically weighted towards vehicles aged 7 to 14 years old. Each year, the United States seasonally adjusted annual rate (“US SAAR”) of new vehicles purchased adds a new year to the VIO. According to data from the Auto Care Association (“Auto Care”), the US SAAR experienced a decline from 2008 to 2011 as consumers purchased fewer new vehicles as a result of the Great Recession of 2008. We believe that the declining US SAAR during that period resulted in a follow-on decline in our primary VIO subsegment (7-to-14-year-old vehicles) commencing in 2016. However, following 2011 and the impact of the Great Recession of 2008, U.S. consumers began to increase their purchases of new vehicles which over time caused the US SAAR to recover and return to more historical levels. The 7-to-14-year-old vehicle car parc has continued to grow over the past several years, which we expect will expand demand for aftermarket replacement parts as more vehicles remain in operation.
32
In addition, we believe that vehicle owners generally are operating their current vehicles longer than they did several years ago, performing necessary repairs and maintenance to keep those vehicles well maintained. We believe this trend has supported an increase in VIO, which increased to 298.5 million, a 1% increase in 2024 over 2023. According to data published by Polk, a division of IHS Automotive, the average age of VIO increased to 12.8 years as of October 2024 from 12.6 years as of October 2023.
Miles Driven
The number of miles driven is another important statistic that impacts our business. Generally, as vehicles are driven more miles, the more likely it is that parts will fail and there will be increased demand for replacement parts, including our parts. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of miles driven through October 2024 increased 1.0% year over year in the light-duty sector. However, global gasoline prices remained high during 2024 and, if they continue, they may negatively impact miles driven as consumers reduce travel or seek alternative methods of transportation. 
Brand Protection
We operate in a highly competitive market. As a result, we are continuously evaluating our approach to brand, pricing, and terms to our different customers and channels. For example, we maintain brand protection policies, which are designed to ensure that certain of our branded products are not advertised below certain approved pricing levels. In addition, we may pursue legal remedies when we see third parties violating our intellectual property rights, including those that violate our patents, wrongfully represent our products as their own, or use our product images for their own marketing efforts.
Discounts, Allowances, and Incentives
We offer a variety of customer discounts, rebates, defective and slow-moving product returns, and other incentives. We may offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice. In addition, we may offer pricing discounts based on volume purchased from us or other pricing discounts related to programs under a customer’s agreement. These incentives can be in the form of “off-invoice” discounts that are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale. For those customers that choose to receive their incentives on a quarterly or annual basis instead of “off-invoice,” we provide rebates and accrue for such incentives as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly. Additionally, rebates and discounts are provided to customers to support promotional activities such as advertising and sales force allowances.
Our customers, particularly our larger retail customers, regularly seek more favorable pricing and product return provisions, and extended payment terms when negotiating with us. We attempt to avoid or minimize these concessions as much as possible, but we have granted pricing concessions, indemnification rights, and extended customer payment terms, and allowed a higher level of product returns in certain cases. These concessions impact net sales as well as our profit levels and may require additional capital to finance the business. We expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on our margins.
Customer Acquisition Costs
We may incur customer acquisition costs where we incur change-over costs to induce a customer to switch from a competitor’s brand, including expanding new product lines into our existing customers. Change-over costs include the costs related to removing the customer’s inventory of competitor products and replacing it with our products, which is commonly referred to as a stock lift. Customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred. 
Product Warranty and Overstock Returns
We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on most of our products in the light-duty parts categories, with more limited warranties for our heavy-duty and specialty vehicle products. In addition to warranty returns, we may permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits if they have overstocked their inventories. At the time products are sold, we accrue a liability for product warranties and overstock returns as a percentage of sales based upon estimates established 
33
using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of the claim and the probability of the customer return. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period. Revisions to these estimates are made when necessary, based upon changes in these factors. We regularly study trends of such claims.
Foreign Currency
Many of our products and related raw materials and components are purchased from suppliers in a variety of non-U.S. countries. The products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we generally do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product.
To the extent that the U.S. dollar changes in value relative to those foreign currencies in the future, the prices charged by our suppliers for goods under new purchase orders may change in equivalent U.S. dollars. The largest portion of our overseas purchases comes from China. The Chinese yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rate has fluctuated over the past several years. Any future changes in the value of the Chinese yuan relative to the U.S. dollar may result in a change in the cost of goods that we purchase from China. However, the cost of the goods we procure is also affected by other factors, including raw material availability, labor costs, tariffs, and transportation costs.
We have operations located outside the United States with various functional currencies. Because our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, the assets, liabilities, net sales, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar must be converted into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our financial results.
Impact of Labor Market and Inflationary Costs
We experienced broad-based inflationary impacts during the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to global transportation and logistics constraints, which resulted in significantly higher transportation costs; tariffs; material costs; and wage inflation from an increasingly competitive labor market. Higher labor costs and material inflation resulting from geopolitical events, rising interest rates, disruptions to supply chain and logistics networks, and the trade policies of the U.S. or the countries where we source or sell our products may negatively impact our results in the future. We attempt to offset inflationary pressures with cost-saving initiatives, price increases to customers, and the use of alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing such cost-saving initiatives, pricing increases, or supplier diversification in the future to offset increased inflationary costs.
Impact of Interest Rates
Our business is subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our customer accounts receivable sales programs, as a change in the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) or alternative discount rate affects the cost incurred to factor eligible accounts receivable. Additionally, our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates tied to Term SOFR or the applicable base rate. Under the terms of the credit facility, a change in interest rates affects the rate at which we can borrow funds thereunder and also impacts the interest cost on existing borrowings. Interest rates may hold steady at their current rates for prolonged periods or may increase in the future, resulting in increased costs associated with our accounts receivable sales programs and outstanding borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we saw significant increases in Term SOFR and other reference rates. Interest rates remained elevated throughout much of 2024, but began to decline starting in the second half of 2024.
Impact of Tariffs
We source the majority of our raw materials and parts from suppliers in a variety of non-U.S. countries. Prior to 2025, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum and certain vehicle parts, which resulted in increased costs for importing those goods into the United States. Those tariffs primarily impacted raw materials and parts that we source from China. We have taken several actions to 
34
mitigate the impact of those tariffs, including, but not limited to, passing along price increases to our customers and negotiating cost concessions from our suppliers. We are actively monitoring recent trade policy and tariff announcements, including the executive orders issued by the President of the United States in February 2025. Among other things, those executive orders directed the United States to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, subsequently paused the imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the United States, and directed federal agencies to investigate how to adjust U.S. tariffs to match those of other countries. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the announced tariffs on our business and financial condition and actions we may take to mitigate the impact. In addition, we are currently monitoring the potential impact, if any, of actions taken by these countries in response to the announced tariffs. There can be no assurance that the recently announced tariffs or future imposition of any tariffs, changes thereto, or potential actions taken by countries in response to the tariffs will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in any period or that any actions we take to mitigate the impact of the tariffs will be effective.

Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023
Net sales increased $79.4 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by volume, including from new product introductions.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 460 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to sales of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $42.8 million, or 120 basis points as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $20.5 million of favorable fair value adjustments in the prior year period to the estimated contingent consideration obligation for an acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs in the current year period.
Our effective tax rate increased to 25.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024 from 23.3% in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to recording a reserve in 2024 in connection with a state tax dispute.

Light Duty
Light Duty net sales increased $103.1 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to volume increases, including sales of new products launched.
Light Duty segment income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and operational excellence initiatives delivering cost-savings, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs.
Heavy Duty
Heavy Duty net sales decreased $25.4 million, or 9.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects reduced customer demand from lower freight industry shipping volumes in the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as sales performance in the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by customers’ inventory restocking at the end of the global pandemic.
Heavy Duty segment income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased by 280 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the deleveraging of fixed costs on lower net sales and the impact of investments we made as part of initiatives to grow sales and improve margins on a long-term basis.
Specialty Vehicle
Specialty Vehicle net sales increased $1.7 million, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to volume increases, including sales of new products launched.
Specialty Vehicle segment income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been our invested cash and the cash flow we generate from our operations, including accounts receivable sales programs facilitated by certain customers. The following table presents key liquidity and capital resource metrics as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our liquidity could be negatively affected by extending payment terms to customers, a decrease in demand for our products, higher interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, or other factors. See Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8, for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies that may affect our liquidity.
At December 31, 2024, our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations include non-cancellable operating leases and outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement as follows:
•
Operating leases – total obligations under non-cancellable operating leases were $146.0 million, with $25.1 million due over the next twelve months. Refer to Note 5, “Leases”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8, for additional information regarding our leases.
•
Credit agreement – total obligations under our credit agreement were $482.8 million, with $28.1 million due over the next twelve months.

Refer to Note 7, “Long-Term Debt”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8, for additional information regarding our credit agreement.
Tariffs
Tariffs increase our use of cash since we pay for the tariffs upon the arrival of our goods in the United States but collect the cash on any passthrough price increases from our customers on a delayed basis according to the payment terms negotiated with our customers.
Payment Terms and Accounts Receivable Sales Programs
Over the past several years, we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands. These extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash. Where available and when we deem appropriate, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers that allow us to sell our accounts receivable to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment term extensions. However, any sales of accounts receivable through these programs ultimately result in us receiving a lesser amount of cash upfront than if we collected those accounts receivable ourselves in due course, resulting in accounts receivable factoring costs. Moreover, since these accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at rates tied to the Term SOFR or other reference rates, increases in these applicable rates increase our cost to sell our receivables and reduce the amount of cash we receive. See ITEM 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more information. Further extensions of customer payment terms would result in additional uses of cash or increased costs associated with the sales of accounts receivable.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold approximately $1,106.4 million and $949.5 million, respectively, under these programs. If receivables had not been sold, $853.6 million and $526.4 million of additional receivables would have been outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on standard payment terms. We had capacity to sell more accounts receivable under these programs if the needs of the business warranted. Further extensions of customer payment terms would result in additional uses of cash or increased costs associated with the sales of accounts receivable.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, factoring costs associated with these accounts receivable sales programs were $51.3 million and $50.2 million, respectively. The increase in factoring costs year over year was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable sold under these programs.
37
Credit Agreement
We have a credit agreement which consists of
 a $600.0 million revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million term loan. The credit agreement matures on October 4, 2027, is guaranteed by the 
Company’s material domestic subsidiaries
, and is

supported by a security interest in substantially all of the 
Company’s material domestic subsidiaries’
 personal property and assets, subject to certain exceptions.
As of December 31, 2024, we were not in default with respect to the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2024, there was $14.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and $468.8 million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion of the credit agreement, and as of such date we had outstanding letters of credit for 
$1.2 
million in the aggregate. Net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had $584.8 million available under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2024.
Refer to Note 7, "Long-Term Debt", to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under ITEM 8, for additional information regarding the credit agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $231.0 million compared to $208.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The $22.3 million increase was primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by working capital changes, primarily higher inventory balances.
Investing activities used $39.3 million and $43.9 million of cash in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher additions for property, plant and equipment in the prior year.
Financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 included $78.9 million paid to repurchase 865,283 shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan, and the repayments of $78.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $15.6 of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repaid $146.6 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $12.5 million of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. The remaining uses of cash from financing activities in each period resulted primarily from the repurchase of our common stock from our 401(k) Plan and income tax withholding in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically have not utilized off-balance sheet financial instruments, and currently do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations, or growth plans. 
We may issue standby letters of credit under our credit agreement. Letters of credit totaling $1.2 million and $1.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Those letters of credit are 
38
issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers' compensation, general liability, and other insurance policies. Each of the outstanding letters of credit has a one-year term from the date of issuance.
We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
Related-Party Transactions
Prior to December 1, 2023, we leased our Colmar, PA facility from an entity in which Steven Berman, our Non-Executive Chairman, and certain of his family members are owners. On December 1, 2023, the Colmar facility was sold to a third party, subject to our lease. We currently lease a portion of our Lewisberry, PA facility from an entity in which Mr. Berman and certain of his family members are owners. The Colmar lease was, and the Lewisberry lease is, a non-cancelable operating lease. The Lewisberry lease expires December 31, 2027.
We also lease our facilities in Madison, IN, and Shreveport, LA, from entities in which Lindsay Hunt, our President, Specialty Vehicle, and certain of her family members are owners. Each lease is a non-cancelable operating lease, was renewed in October 2022 in connection with the acquisition of Super ATV, LLC, a leading supplier to the powersports aftermarket ("SuperATV"), and will expire on October 31, 2027.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to different assumptions or conditions. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex estimates, judgments, and assumptions.
Accrued Customer Rebates and Returns. 
We record estimates for cash discounts, defective and slow-moving product returns, promotional rebates, core return deposits, and other discounts in the period of the sale ("Customer Credits"). The provision for Customer Credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for Customer Credits are shown as an increase of accrued customer rebates and returns, which is included in current liabilities. Customer Credits are estimated based on contractual provisions, historical experience, and our assessment of current market conditions. Historically, actual Customer Credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts. 
Excess and Obsolete Inventory Reserves
. We must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs. We provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand, forecasted usage, estimated customer requirements, and product line updates. We maintain contact 
39
with our customer base to understand buying patterns, customer preferences, and the life cycle of our products. Changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves, as needed.
Purchase Accounting
. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause the final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Any adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period which cannot exceed twelve months from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 2, "Business Acquisitions and Investments”, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Accounts receivable factored under our customer-sponsored accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at rates tied to Term SOFR or alternative discount rates and result in us incurring costs as those accounts receivable are factored. Additionally, interest expense from our variable rate debt is impacted by reference rates. 
Under the terms of our customer-sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable, a change in the reference rate would affect the amount of financing costs we incur, and the amount of cash we receive upon the sales of accounts receivable under these programs. A one-percentage-point increase in Term SOFR or the discount rates on the accounts receivable sales programs would have increased our factoring costs and reduced the amount of cash we would have received by approximately $8.8 million, $7.9 million, and $8.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Under the terms of our credit agreement, a change in the reference rate or the lender’s base rate would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder. A one-percentage-point increase in the reference rate or base rate would have increased our interest expense on our variable rate debt under our credit agreement by approximately $5.6 million, $6.8 million, and $2.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
These estimates assume that our level of sales of accounts receivable and variable rate debt balance remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period. The hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what occurs in the future. See ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Finances” for information regarding the risks relating to our indebtedness, our accounts receivable sales agreements, and interest rates.
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our financial statement schedule that is filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K is listed in PART IV –ITEM 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.”

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Dorman Products, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dorman Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Accrual for customer credits for defective product returns
As disclosed in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates customer credits for defective product returns and other items. The accrual for customer credits to be issued for defective product returns includes assumptions about the length of time between when a sale occurs and a credit is issued. The provision for customer credits is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction from gross 
41
sales and accruals for customer credits are a portion of accrued customer rebates and returns. At December 31, 2024, accrued customer rebates and returns were $204.4 million.
We identified the evaluation of the accrual for customer credits for defective product returns as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s determination of the impact of market conditions on the length of time between when a sale occurs and a credit is issued for defective product returns. 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to record the accrual for customer credits for defective product returns. This included a control related to the determination of the impact of market conditions on the length of time between when a sale occurs and a credit is issued for defective product returns. We assessed the Company’s accrual for customer credits for defective product returns by evaluating (1) the historical relationship between sales and customer credits for defective product returns, (2) the Company’s internal data, (3) certain external market data, and (4) a sample of executed third-party contracts. We inquired of personnel within the Company’s quality control department regarding the impact of current market conditions on the length of time between when a sale occurs and a credit is issued for defective product returns. We analyzed a sample of customer credits issued after year-end and evaluated their effect on the accrual.

DORMAN PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Dorman Products, Inc. ("Dorman", the "Company", “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a supplier of replacement and upgrade parts in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, serving passenger cars, light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks as well as specialty vehicles, including utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). We operate through 
three
 business segments: Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and Specialty Vehicle, consistent with the sectors of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry in which we operate. For more information on our segments, refer to Note 8, "Segment Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Principles of Consolidation
. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
. We consider all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Sales of Accounts Receivable
. We have entered into several customer-sponsored programs administered by unrelated financial institutions that permit us to sell certain accounts receivable at discounted rates to the financial institutions. Transactions under these programs were accounted for as sales of accounts receivable and were removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time of the sales transactions.

Sales of accounts receivable under these agreements, and related factoring costs, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were as follows:

Inventories
. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories include the cost of material, freight, direct labor, and overhead utilized in the processing of our products. We provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand, forecasted usage, estimated customer requirements, and product line updates.
Property, Plant and Equipment
. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives, which range from 
1
 to 
39
 years, using the straight-line method for financial statement reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Renewals and betterments are capitalized. Gains and losses on disposals are included in operating results.
Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows:
Buildings and building improvements
10

39
 years
Machinery, equipment, and tooling

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
. Long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and amortizable identifiable intangibles, are reviewed for impairment 
47
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The impairment review is a two-step process. First, recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the second step of the impairment test is performed, and an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired. For the annual test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (“Step 0”). If through the Step 0 test we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (or if the Company elects to not perform Step 0), then we would perform a quantitative test (“Step 1”) to determine whether an impairment charge was necessary. During 2023 and 2024, we elected to perform a Step 1 test of our goodwill for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment. For both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Purchase Accounting
. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause the final amounts to differ materially from their original estimates. These adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period which cannot exceed 12 months from the date of acquisition.
Other Assets
. Other assets include primarily core inventory, deposits, and equity method investments.
Certain products we sell contain parts that can be recycled, or as more commonly referred to in our industry, remanufactured. We refer to these parts as cores. A used core is remanufactured and sold to a customer. Customers and end-users will generally return used cores to us, which we then use in the remanufacturing process to make another finished good. 
Core inventory was $
15.4
 million and $
20.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is classified as long-term based on our view that the value of the cores is not expected to be consumed or realized in cash during our normal annual operating cycle.
We have investments that we account for according to the equity method of accounting. The total book value of these investments was $
11.2
 million and $
10.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investments provided $
5.3
 million, $
5.7
 million, and $
5.5
 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Additionally, we have an investment that we account for according to the cost method of accounting.
 The carrying book value of this investment was $
5.0
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Other Accrued Liabilities. 
Other accrued liabilities include primarily accrued commissions, accrued income taxes, insurance liabilities, and other current liabilities.
Revenue Recognition and Accrued Customer Rebates and Returns
. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, in an amount representing the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for selling products to its customers. We record estimates for cash discounts, defective and slow-moving product returns, promotional rebates, core return deposits, and other discounts in the period of the sale ("Customer Credits"). The provision for Customer Credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for Customer Credits are shown as an increase of accrued customer rebates and returns, which is included in current liabilities. The provision for Customer Credits is estimated based on contractual provisions, historical experience, and our assessment of current market conditions and includes various assumptions including, but not limited to, the length of time between when a sale occurs and a credit is issued. Actual Customer Credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts. 
48
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold.
As noted above, Customer Credits include core return deposits which are an estimate of the amount we believe we will refund to our customers when used cores are returned to us. The price we invoice to customers for remanufactured cores contains both the amount we charge to remanufacture the part and a deposit for the core. We charge a core deposit to encourage the customer to return the used core to us so that it can be used in our remanufacturing process. We allow our customers up to 
twenty-four months
 to return the used core to us. Core return deposits are reserved based on the expected deposits to be issued to customers based on historical returns.
Research and Development
. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 Research and development costs totaling $
32.1
 million, $
32.3
 million, and $
24.8
 million have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
. At December 31, 2024, we had awards outstanding under a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 13, "Capital Stock." We record compensation expense for all awards granted. The value of time-based restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) issued was based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance-based RSUs, for which the performance measure is total shareholder return relative to a defined peer group, is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of performance-based RSUs for which the performance measure is return on invested capital over the performance period was based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of stock options granted is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model on the grant date.

Income Taxes
. We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are paid or recovered.
Unrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns that have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit is recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, we accrue interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Concentrations of Risk
. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All cash equivalents are managed within established guidelines that limit the amount that may be invested with one issuer. A significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been, and will continue to be, concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the United States. Our 
4
 largest customers accounted for 
78
% and 
74
% of net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We continually monitor the credit terms and credit limits for these and other customers.

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
72
% and 
70
%, respectively, of our products were purchased from suppliers in a variety of non-U.S. countries, with the largest portion of our overseas purchases being made in China.
Fair Value Disclosures
. The carrying value of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair value based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value because it bears interest at a rate indexed to a market rate (Term SOFR). Additionally, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined at the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration 
49
associated with an acquisition is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires additional disclosures about reportable segments’ significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis. We adopted this guidance for our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and applied the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The disclosures for interim periods will be adopted in our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2025. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. See Note 8, "Segment Information," for further details on segment information.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU expands disclosures in the income tax rate reconciliations table and cash taxes paid and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The ASU requires additional disclosures about categories of expenses, including, among other things, quantitative disclosures for employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, selling expenses, and purchases of inventory. The updated guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.
We expect to implement these new standards by their effective dates, and do not expect their adoption to have an impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Business Acquisitions and Investments
Super ATV, LLC (“SuperATV”)
On October 4, 2022, Dorman acquired 
100
% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SuperATV (the “Transaction”), for aggregate consideration of $
509.8
 million (net of $
6.8
 million cash acquired), plus a potential earn-out payment to the sellers of SuperATV not to exceed $
100
 million in the aggregate, subject to the achievement by SuperATV of certain revenue and gross margin targets in the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. See Note 11, "Commitments and Contingencies," for additional information on contingent consideration associated with the Transaction. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we received $
0.3
 million in cash as proceeds from the closing net working capital adjustments. SuperATV is a leading independent supplier to the powersports aftermarket with a family of highly respected brands spanning functional accessories and upgrades, as well as replacement parts for specialty vehicles. 
The Transaction was funded in cash through the refinancing of our existing credit facility discussed further in Note 7, "Long-Term Debt."
The Transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. We have allocated the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation for SuperATV assets acquired and liabilities assumed was complete as of September 30, 2023.

Leases
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified fixed asset explicitly or implicitly for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if we obtain the rights to direct the use of the asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from its use. We have operating leases for distribution centers, sales offices, and certain warehouse and office equipment. Our operating leases have remaining lease terms of 
1
 to 
9
 years, many of which include one or more renewal options. We consider these renewal options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is determined that it is reasonably certain that the renewal option will be exercised. Substantially all of our equipment leases and some of our real estate leases have terms of less than one year. Some of our operating lease agreements include variable lease costs, primarily taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or increases in rental costs related to inflation. 
Operating leases are included in the right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at each lease’s commencement date based on the present values of its lease payments over its respective lease term. When a borrowing rate is not explicitly available for a lease, our incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the lease’s commencement date to determine the present value of its lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is not commonly quoted and is derived through a combination of inputs including our credit rating and the impact of full collateralization. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term to the lease payments. We utilized the consolidated group borrowing rate for all leases as we operate a centralized treasury operation. Operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We had no material finance leases as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Practical Expedients and Accounting Policy Elections
We have made certain accounting policy elections and are using certain practical expedients permitted under GAAP, as follows:
•
Include both lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, as non-lease components of contracts have not historically been material.
•
Account for leases with terms of one year or less as short-term leases and, as such, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities.
52
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material variable lease costs or sublease income. Cash paid for operating leases was $
22.8
 million, $
21.2
 million, and $
16.8
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which is classified in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Long-Term Debt
We have a credit agreement which consists of a $
600.0
 million revolving credit facility and a
 $
500.0
 million term loan. The credit agreement matures on October 4, 2027, is guaranteed by the 
Company’s material domestic subsidiaries
, and is supported by a security interest in substantially all of the 
Company’s material domestic subsidiaries’
 personal property and assets, subject to certain exceptions
.
Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) or a base rate (as defined in the credit agreement), in each case plus an applicable margin, based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). 
54
Unutilized revolving credit facility capacity incurs a commitment fee based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 
5.71
% and the commitment fee was 
0.15
%.
The term loan portion of the credit agreement contains mandatory repayment provisions that require quarterly principal amortization payments. The following table presents the principal amortization payments and maturities on the term loan for each of the years noted, as of December 31, 2024:

The credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants regarding capital expenditures, share repurchases, and financial covenants related to the ratio of consolidated interest expense to consolidated EBITDA and the ratio of total net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, each as defined by the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we were not in default of the covenants contained in the credit agreement.
8. 
Segment Information
We operate and report our results in 
three
 business segments, Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and Specialty Vehicle, consistent with the three sectors of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry in which we participate. The Light Duty segment designs and markets replacement parts and fasteners primarily for passenger cars and light trucks with sales to retailers and wholesale distributors who primarily serve passenger car and light truck customers. The Heavy Duty segment designs and markets replacement parts primarily for medium and heavy trucks with sales to independent distributors, independent component specialists and rebuilders, and auto parts stores that focus on the heavy-duty market. The Specialty Vehicle segment designs, markets, and manufactures aftermarket parts and accessories for the powersports market with sales through direct-to-consumer, dealers, and installers. 
The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses income from operations to assess segment performance. The CODM utilizes this measure for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting cycles and considers performance against established targets for purposes of allocating Company resources to each segment and in the determination of compensation for certain Contributors. We measure segment income from operations based on income from operations excluding acquisition-related intangible assets amortization, acquisition-related transaction and other costs, and other special charges. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on segment net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales. Segment assets consist of inventories, accounts receivable, and property, plant and equipment, net. Intersegment sales are not material.

Related Party Transactions
Prior to December 1, 2023, we leased our Colmar, PA facility from an entity in which Steven Berman, our Non-Executive Chairman, and certain of his family members are owners. On December 1, 2023, the Colmar facility was sold to a third party, subject to our lease. We also lease a portion of our Lewisberry, PA facility from an entity in which Mr. Berman and certain of his family members are owners. The Colmar lease was, and the Lewisberry lease is, a non-cancelable operating lease. The Lewisberry lease expires December 31, 2027.
We also lease our facilities in Madison, IN, and Shreveport, LA, from entities in which Lindsay Hunt, our President, Specialty Vehicle, and certain of her family members are owners. Each lease is a non-cancelable operating lease, was renewed in October 2022 in connection with the acquisition of Super ATV, LLC, a leading supplier to the powersports aftermarket ("SuperATV"), and will expire on October 31, 2027.
We have service agreements with counterparties that are majority-owned by a family member of Ms. Hunt. These agreements provide for various warehouse and facility-related services at agreed-upon rates.

A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, the Company assesses all positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax asset. Management has determined it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against the foreign tax credits, various state tax credits, and a capital loss carryforward.
Based on our history of taxable income and our projection of future earnings, we believe that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the foreseeable future to realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. 
During 2024, we increased the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets noted above by an immaterial amount.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has tax-effected net operating loss carryforwards of $
0.2
 million and $
0.1
 million for U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, respectively. Tax-effected federal net operating losses of $
0.1
 million begin to expire in 
2036
. The remaining federal net operating losses do not expire. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years starting in 
2037
.
We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada, China, India, and Mexico. The statute of limitations for tax years before 2021 is closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The statute of limitations for tax years before 2017 is closed for the states in which we file. The statute of limitations for tax years before 2021 is closed for income tax purposes in Canada, China, and India. The statute of limitations for tax years before 2019 is closed for income tax purposes in Mexico.

Commitments and Contingencies
Shareholders’ Agreement
. A shareholders’ agreement was entered into in September 1990 and amended and restated on July 1, 2006. Under the agreement, each of the late Richard Berman, Steven Berman, Jordan Berman, Marc Berman, Fred Berman, Deanna Berman, and additional shareholders named in the agreement has, among other things, granted the others of them rights of first refusal, exercisable on a pro-rata basis or in such other proportions as the exercising shareholders may agree, to purchase shares of our common stock which any of them, or upon their deaths their respective estates, proposes to sell to third parties. We have agreed with these shareholders that, upon their deaths, to the extent that any of their shares are not purchased by any of these surviving shareholders and may not be sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), we will use our best efforts to cause those shares to be registered under the 1933 Act. The expenses of any such registration will be borne by the estate of the deceased shareholder. The additional shareholders that are a party to the agreement are trusts affiliated with the late Richard Berman, Steven Berman, Jordan Berman, Marc Berman, or Fred Berman, or each person’s respective spouse or children.
Acquisitions.
 We have contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions due to the uncertainty of the ultimate amount of any payments that will become due as earnout payments if performance targets are achieved. If the remaining performance targets for the acquisitions are fully achieved, the maximum additional contingent payments to be made under the transaction documents would be $
102.0
 million in the aggregate.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimated that 
zero
 payments are expected to become due in connection with the acquisitions, and therefore accrued no liability.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a net decrease of $
20.0
 million to the contingent consideration liability for a prior acquisition, comprising a $
20.5
 million decrease in fair value based on the modeling of a range of performance outcomes relative to the achievement of targets established in the purchase agreement, partially offset by $
0.5
 million of accretion on the liability resulting from the passage of time. The net benefit was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a charge of $
1.8
 million in connection with earnout provisions under a prior acquisition, with the charge included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $
1.8
 million to fully settle this earnout provision associated with the prior acquisition.
Other Contingencies
. We are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as various claims and legal actions involving contracts, employment claims, competitive practices, intellectual property infringement, product liability claims, and other matters arising out of the conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, none of the actions, individually or in the aggregate, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, would likely have a material financial impact on the Company and we believe the range of reasonably possible losses from current matters, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, is immaterial. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial position, and results of operations in the period in which any such effects are recorded.
12. 
Revenue Recognition
Our primary source of revenue is from contracts with and purchase orders from customers. In most instances, our contract with a customer is the customer’s purchase order. Upon acceptance of the purchase order, a contract exists with a customer, as a sales agreement indicates the approval and commitment of the parties, identifies the rights of both parties, identifies the payment terms, and has commercial substance. At this point, we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods transferred to the customer. 
For certain customers, we may also enter into a sales agreement that outlines pricing considerations as well as the framework of terms and conditions that apply to future purchase orders for that customer. In these situations, our contract with the customer is both the sales agreement as well as the specific customer purchase 
60
order. As our contract with a customer is typically for a single transaction or customer purchase order, the duration of the contract is typically 
one year
 or less. As a result, we have elected to apply certain practical expedients and omit certain disclosures of remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an initial term of one year or less as permitted by GAAP.
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, in an amount representing the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for selling products to its customers. We estimate the transaction price at the inception of a contract or upon fulfilling a purchase order, including any variable consideration, and will update the estimate for changes in circumstances. 
We record estimates for cash discounts, defective and slow-moving product returns, promotional rebates, core return deposits, and other discounts in the period the related product revenue is recognized (“Customer Credits”). The provision for Customer Credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for Customer Credits are shown as an increase in accrued customer rebates and returns. Customer Credits are estimated based on contractual provisions, historical experience, and our assessment of current market conditions. Actual Customer Credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold. We have concluded that our estimates of variable consideration are not constrained according to the definition in the standard. 
All of our revenue was recognized under the point-of-time approach during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Also, we do not have significant financing arrangements with our customers. Our credit terms are all less than 
one year
. Lastly, we do not receive noncash consideration (such as materials or equipment) from our customers to facilitate the fulfillment of our contracts. 
Practical Expedients and Accounting Policy Elections
We have made certain accounting policy elections and are using certain practical expedients permitted under GAAP, as follows:
•
Do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be 
one year
 or less.
•
Expense costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected period of benefit, and therefore the amortization period, is 
one year
 or less.
•
Exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the entity for a customer, including sales, use, value-added, excise, and various other taxes.
•
Account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment activity rather than a separate performance obligation.

Capital Stock
Controlling Interest by Officers, Directors and Family Members
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Steven Berman, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company, and members of his family beneficially owned approximately 
15
% and 
16
%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and could influence matters requiring approval of shareholders, including the election of the Board of Directors and the approval of significant transactions.
Undesignated Stock
. We have 
50,000,000
 shares authorized of undesignated capital stock for future issuance. The designation, rights, and preferences of such shares will be determined by our Board of Directors.
Incentive Stock Plan
. Prior to May 16, 2018, we issued stock compensation grants under our 2008 Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plan. On 
May 16, 2018
, our shareholders approved our 2018 Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan” or the “Plan”), which supersedes our 2008 Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plan. All future stock compensation grants will be issued under the 2018 Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, our Board of Directors may grant up to 
1,200,000
 shares of common stock in the form of shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock options, or combinations thereof, to officers, directors, employees, consultants, and advisors. Grants under the Plan must be made on or before the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan was approved. Stock options are exercisable upon the terms set forth in each grant agreement approved by the Board of Directors, but in no event more than 
ten years
 from the date of grant. Restricted stock and restricted stock units vest in accordance with the terms set forth in each applicable award agreement approved by our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2024, 
329,263
 shares were available for grant under the Plan.
Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
Prior to March 2020, we issued RSAs to certain employees and members of our Board of Directors. Grants were made in the form of time-based RSAs and performance-based RSAs. For all RSAs, we retain the restricted stock, and any dividends paid thereon, until the vesting restrictions have been met. For time-based RSAs, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is calculated using the closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation cost related to those performance-based RSAs was recognized over the performance period and was calculated using the closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date and an estimate of the probable outcome of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. In 2019, we introduced performance-based RSAs that vest based on our total shareholder return ranking relative to the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index over a 
three-year
 performance period (market condition). For those awards containing a market condition, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period and is calculated using the simulated fair value per share of our common stock based on the application of a Monte Carlo simulation model. This valuation technique includes estimating the movement of stock prices and the effects of volatility, interest rates, and dividends.
We issue RSUs to certain employees and members of our Board of Directors. For time-based RSUs, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is calculated using the closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date. Performance-based RSUs granted starting in the year ended December 31, 2024 included certain grants that vest based on our total shareholder return ranking relative to the Nasdaq US Benchmark Auto Parts Index over a three-year performance period (market condition), and other grants that vest based upon achievement of return on invested capital targets over a three-year performance period (performance condition).
For performance-based RSUs with a market condition, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period and is calculated using the simulated fair value per share of our common 
62
stock based on the application of a Monte Carlo simulation model as discussed in the paragraph above. For performance-based RSUs with a performance condition, compensation cost is recognized over the performance period and is calculated using the closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date and an estimate of the probable outcome of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.
The following table summarizes the weighted average valuation assumptions used to calculate the fair value of total shareholder return performance-based RSUs containing a market condition granted:

The share price is the Company’s closing share price as of the valuation date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security with terms equal to the expected time of vesting as of the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the RSUs containing a market condition granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were $
138.58
, $
113.15
, and $
111.31
, respectively.
Compensation cost related to performance-based and time-based RSAs and RSUs was $
12.3
 million, $
9.1
 million, and $
7.2
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No cost was capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Stock Options
We grant stock options to certain employees. We expense the grant-date fair value of stock options as compensation cost over the vesting or performance period. Compensation cost charged against income for stock options was $
1.6
 million, $
2.0
 million, and $
1.7
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and was included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No cost was capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
We used the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. Expected volatility and expected dividend yield are based on the actual historical experience of our common stock. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using historical option exercise data. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security with terms equal to the expected time of exercise as of the grant date.
There were no stock options granted in 2024. 
The following table summarizes the weighted-average valuation assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted and the associated weighted-average grant-date fair values:

As of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $
2.1
 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 
1.9
 years.
64
Cash received from option exercises was $
4.7
 million, $
1.2
 million, and $
1.0
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax benefit generated from option exercises was immaterial for all periods presented. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
Our shareholders approved the Dorman Products, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which makes available 
1,000,000
 shares of our common stock for sale to eligible employees. The purpose of the ESPP, which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, as amended, is to encourage stock ownership through payroll deductions and limited cash contributions by our employees. These contributions are used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a 
15
% discount from the lower of the market price at the beginning or end of the purchase window. The two purchase windows are January to June and July to December. There were 
28,674
 shares, 
29,650
 shares, and 
25,600
 shares purchased under this plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Compensation cost under the ESPP plan was $
1.1
 million, $
0.4
 million, and $
0.4
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax benefit generated from ESPP purchases was immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Common Stock Repurchases. 
We periodically repurchase, at the then current market price, and cancel common stock issued to the Dorman Products, Inc. 401(k) Plan and Trust (the “401(k) Plan”). 401(k) Plan participants can no longer purchase shares of Dorman common stock as an investment option under the 401(k) Plan. Shares are generally purchased from the 401(k) Plan when participants sell units as permitted by the 401(k) Plan or elect to leave the 401(k) Plan upon retirement, termination, or other reasons.

Share Repurchase Program
. Our Board of Directors previously authorized a share repurchase program. Under that program, and subsequent authorizations (the “Existing Program”), the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $
600
 million of our outstanding common stock through December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, $
134.6
 million was available for repurchase under this program. The Existing Program expired on December 31, 2024, along with all amounts that remained available for use under the Existing Program as of that date. 
In October 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $
500
 million of our common stock under a new share repurchase program effective as of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “New Program”).
The New Program will operate just as the Existing Program had operated in that share repurchases may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, share availability, and other factors at the Company’s discretion. The New Program, similar to the Existing Program, will not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.

65
respective plan documents. Total expense related to the plans was $
13.1
 million, $
9.1
 million, and $
8.2
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

14. 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing our net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested RSAs which are considered to be contingently issuable. To calculate diluted earnings per share, common share equivalents are added to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Common share equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and are computed based on outstanding stock-based awards. Stock-based awards of approximately 
190,000
 shares, 
297,500
 shares, and 
63,500
 shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of December 31, 2024, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears below.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Dorman Products, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Dorman Products, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
68
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
