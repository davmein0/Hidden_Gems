ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED S
TOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Wesbanco’s common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market under the symbol WSBC. The approximate number of record holders of Wesbanco’s $2.0833 par value common stock as of February 20, 2025 was 6,551. The number of holders does not include Wesbanco employees who have purchased stock or had stock allocated to them through Wesbanco’s 401(k) plan (the “401(k)”). All Wesbanco employees who meet the eligibility requirements of the 401(k) are included in this retirement plan.

As of December 31, 2024, Wesbanco had one active stock repurchase plan which was approved by the Board of Directors on February 24, 2022 for 3.2 million shares. This plan provides for shares to be repurchased for general corporate purposes, which may include a subsequent resource for potential acquisitions, shareholder dividend reinvestment and/or employee benefit plans. The timing, price and quantity of purchases are at the discretion of Wesbanco, and the plan may be discontinued or suspended at any time. The plan has 972,298 shares remaining for repurchase.

Repurchases in the fourth quarter included those for the 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans.

Certain information relating to securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is set forth under the heading “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in Part III, “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.”

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Wesbanco’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.

The most significant accounting policies followed by Wesbanco are included in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and this MD&A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management has identified the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and business combinations to be the accounting estimates that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.

Allowance for Credit Losses—
 The allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected credit losses at the initial origination date. Similarly, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities, represents expected losses on unfunded commitments. Fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses specific to loans, the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities are recognized in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of operations. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is

28

increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.  Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.

The allowance for credit losses specific to loans reflects the risk of loss in the loan portfolio. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes the PD / LGD approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rate spreads, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, portfolio mix and loan growth.  Management relies on macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable third party sources.  These forecasts can range from one to two years, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management’s judgment of what can be reasonably supported.  The model reversion period can range from immediate to up to three years.

After the forecast period, Wesbanco reverts back to historical loss rates for a period of up to three years, adjusting for prepayments and curtailments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of loans. The most sensitive assumptions include the length of the forecast and reversion periods, forecast of unemployment and interest rate spreads and prepayment speeds. See Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” for further detail.

The allowance for credit loss calculation specific to loans is based on the loan’s amortized cost basis, which is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, deferred loan fees (costs) and acquired premium (discount) minus any write-downs. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, because the Company has a robust policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when the loan is placed on non-accrual, and also made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income.  However, Wesbanco is reserving, as part of the allowance for credit losses, for accrued interest on loan modifications under the CARES Act due to the nature and timing of these deferrals.

The allowance for credit losses specific to loans is calculated over the loan’s contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For commercial and industrial (“C&I”) revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the internal review date. For all other revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. The contractual term does not include expected extensions, renewals or modifications.

Contractual terms are adjusted for estimated prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. Wesbanco models term loans with an annualized “prepayment” rate. When Wesbanco has a specific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.

The evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, volume of activity, changes in lending staff, type of collateral and the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the actual historical loss rates to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio.

Commercial loans, including CRE and C&I that have unique characteristics, are tested individually for estimated credit losses.  Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any. The present value of expected future cash flows are discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral discounted by the estimated selling expenses, if the loan is collateral dependent. Wesbanco chooses the appropriate measurement method on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually evaluated loan, except for collateral dependent loans for which foreclosure of the collateral is probable. A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. If the Bank determines that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, ASC 326-20 requires that the expected credit loss be based on the difference between the current fair value of the collateral discounted by the estimated selling expenses and the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. At this point, the loan would either be charged down or adequately reserved.

Under CECL, acquired loans or pools of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration are deemed to be purchased credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, and are grossed-up on day 1 by the initial credit estimate through the allowance as opposed to a reduction in the loan’s amortized cost. The credit mark on acquired loans deemed not to be PCD loans are reflected as a reduction in the loan’s amortized cost, with an allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses recorded in the first reporting period after acquisition through current period earnings, while the loan mark will accrete through interest income over the life of such loans. At acquisition, Wesbanco will consider several factors as indicators that an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loans 30 days or more past due, loans with an internal risk grade of below average or lower, loans classified as non-accrual by the acquired institution, materiality of the credit and loans that have been previously modified. Upon adoption of this standard, acquired loans from prior acquisitions that met the guidelines under ASC 310-30 (formerly known as “purchased credit-impaired”) were reclassified as PCD loans. The accretable portion of the loan mark

29

as of adoption date continues to accrete into interest income. However, the non-accretable portion of the loan mark was added to the allowance upon adoption, and any reversals of such mark will flow through the allowance in future periods. The loan mark on ASC 310-20 loans (“non-purchased credit-impaired”) from prior acquisitions continues to accrete through interest income over the life of such loans.

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation, significant changes to the allowance for credit losses could occur in future periods.

Goodwill —
 Wesbanco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.

Wesbanco evaluates goodwill for impairment by determining if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of its reporting units. Wesbanco uses market capitalization, multiples of tangible book value, a discounted cash flow model, and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. In particular, the discounted cash flow model includes various assumptions regarding an investor’s required rate of return on Wesbanco common stock, future loan loss provisions, future market spreads and net interest margins, along with various growth and economic recovery and stabilization assumptions of the economy as a whole. The resulting fair values of each method are then weighted based on the relevance and reliability of each respective method in light of the current economic environment to arrive at a weighted average fair value. The evaluation also considered macroeconomic conditions such as the general economic outlook, regional and national unemployment rates, and recent trends in equity and credit markets. Additionally, industry and market considerations, such as market-dependent multiples and metrics relative to peers, were evaluated. Wesbanco also considered recent trends in credit quality, overall financial performance, stock price appreciation, internal forecasts and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. Since adopting ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)”, the impairment charge is based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value.  Wesbanco completed its annual quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation as of November 30, 2024, and concluded that there were no indications of impairment.  In addition, as there were no significant changes in market conditions, consolidated operating results or forecasted future results after November 30, 2024, it was concluded that at December 31, 2024, there were also no indications of impairment.

Business Combinations—
 Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgments. Core deposits intangibles are calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative funds and net maintenance costs.

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value with no carryover of related allowance for credit losses. Acquired loans are classified into two categories; PCD loans and non-PCD loans. PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans will have an allowance established on acquisition date, which is recognized in the current period provision for credit losses. For PCD loans, an allowance is recognized on day 1 by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the “Day 1 amortized cost”. There is no credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest.  Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Through successful operational execution, Wesbanco generated solid annual net income, while remaining a well-capitalized institution with sound liquidity and credit quality metrics. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, net income available to common shareholders was $141.4 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, as compared to $148.9 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Net income available to common shareholders excluding after-tax restructuring and merger-related expenses (non-GAAP measure) was $146.4 million, or $2.34 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2024. These decreases were due in large part to the higher funding costs for both deposits and borrowings, inflationary cost pressures, and the recording of a larger provision expense as compared to the prior year.  Interest income increased $114.1 million or 16.0% to $825.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023.  Net interest income decreased $3.1 million or 0.7% from 2023, primarily due to higher funding costs. Non-interest income increased $7.5 million or 6.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by a $3.9 million increase in service charges on deposits, a $2.5 million increase in trust fees and a $1.6 million increase in mortgage banking income. Excluding restructuring and merger-related expenses, non-interest expense increased $9.3 million or 2.4%, driven by increases in other operating, equipment and software, FDIC insurance, salaries and wages expense.

 Total assets as of December 31, 2024 were $18.7 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, total portfolio loans were $12.7 billion compared to $11.6 billion at December 31, 2023, reflecting an 8.7% increase year-over year.  The loan growth funding is reflected within the increase in total deposits of $965.0 million or 7.3% at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Criticized and classified loan balances increased to 2.80% of total portfolio loans, as compared to 2.22% at December 31, 2023.  Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans for the full year period increased seven basis points compared to 2023.

Wesbanco continues to maintain what we believe are strong regulatory capital ratios, as both consolidated and bank-level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable “well-capitalized” standards promulgated by bank regulators and the BASEL III capital standards. At December 31, 2024, Tier I leverage was 10.68%, Tier I risk-based capital was 13.06%, total risk-based capital was 15.88%, and the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.07%.

Strong earnings enabled Wesbanco to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2024, the eighteenth increase over the last fourteen years, cumulatively representing a 164% increase over that period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS SUMMARY

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income available to common shareholders was $141.4 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, compared to $148.9 million, or $2.51 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased 5.1% compared to 2023, while diluted per share earnings decreased 10.0%.

 For the year ended December 31, 2024, net interest income decreased $3.1 million or 0.7%, primarily due to higher funding costs offsetting the impact of loan growth and higher earning asset yields year-to-date.  This also resulted in a decrease in the net interest margin of 18 basis points to 2.96% in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to the overall higher rate environment and its effect on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. Average loan balances increased 9.5% in 2024, mostly due to a lower level of commercial real estate payoffs and continued strong performance by the commercial and residential lending teams, while average investment securities decreased 7.4% over the same period. Total average deposits increased in 2024 by $630.3 million or 4.9% compared to 2023, due to customer preferences in the higher interest rate environment and deposit gathering initiatives implemented by management.

For 2024, non-interest income increased $7.5 million or 6.3% compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in trust fees, service charges on deposits, mortgage banking income and other income, which was positively influenced by a $2.3 million settlement gain on the transfer of future pension accumulated benefit obligations to a third-party annuity company.  These increases were offset somewhat by decreases in net swap fee and valuation income, bank-owned life insurance and net gains on other real estate owned and other assets.

The following comments on non-interest expense exclude restructuring and merger-related expenses in both years. Non-interest expense in 2024 increased $9.3 million or 2.4% compared to 2023, while the efficiency ratio increased in 2024 to 64.7% from 63.6% in 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were a $5.3 million increase in other operating expenses, a $4.6 million increase in equipment and software expenses and a $2.0 million increase in FDIC insurance expense. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in marketing expense, employee benefits expense and lower amortization expense on intangible assets.

The provision for federal and state income taxes decreased to $33.6 million in 2024 compared to $35.0 million in 2023, due primarily to lower pre-tax income in 2024. The effective tax rate was 18.2% and 18.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Wesbanco recognized $3.8 million and $3.7 million in New Markets Tax Credits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net interest income, which is Wesbanco’s largest source of revenue, is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, primarily deposits and short and long-term borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the general level of, and changes in interest rates, the steepness and shape of the yield curve, changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as the frequency of repricing of existing assets and liabilities. Net interest income decreased $3.1 million or 0.7% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher funding costs offsetting the impact of loan growth and higher earning assets year-to-date.  Rates were impacted from the 525 basis point increase in the federal funds rate since the first quarter of 2022, while federal funds rates did see a 100 basis point cut late in 2024, the interest rate environment generally remained elevated.  Total average deposits, excluding CDs, increased in 2024 by $171.5 million or 1.4% compared to 2023, due to the success of deposit gathering and retention. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased by 97 basis points and the cost of total liabilities increased by 82 basis points from 2023 to 2024. The increase in the cost is primarily due to the effect of the previously mentioned federal funds rate increases on the rates paid on interest bearing demand deposits, customer repurchase agreements, term Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and junior subordinated debentures.

Interest income increased $114.1 million or 16.0% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher yields in most of the major earning asset categories.  Earning asset yields were influenced positively in 2024 compared to 2023 from the previously mentioned increases in the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate of 525 basis points since the first quarter of 2022.  Average loan balances increased $1.1 billion or 9.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to strong performance by banking teams across all markets. Loan yields increased by 47 basis points during 2024 to 5.83% due to the previously mentioned higher rate environment and its effect on the repricing of portfolio loans, as well as higher offered rates on new loans.  Loans provide the greatest impact on interest income and the yield on earning assets as they have the largest balance and the highest yield within major earning asset categories.  In 2024, average loans represented 74.8% of average earning assets, an increase from 72.0% in 2023. Taxable securities yields increased by 11 basis points in 2024 due to higher yields on new purchases.  Decreased prepayments on mortgage-backed securities in the higher rate environment also further benefited the taxable securities yields due to reduced amortization on securities purchased at a premium. Tax-exempt securities yields increased by two basis points in 2024 from 2023. The average balance of tax-exempt securities, which have the highest yields within securities, increased from 19.9% of total average securities in 2023 to 20.5% of total average securities in 2024.

Interest expense increased $117.3 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to increases in the cost of most interest bearing liability categories in the higher rate environment. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 82 basis points from 2023 to 3.07% in 2024.  Average interest bearing deposits increased by $1.1 billion or 12.5% from 2023 to 2024.  The rate on interest bearing deposits increased 97 basis points to 2.72% in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily from increases in rates on interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and savings deposits in response to competitive pressures from higher market rates. Average non-interest bearing demand deposit balances decreased from 2023 to 2024 by $452.9 million or 10.5%, and were 28.4% of total average deposits at December 31, 2024, compared to 33.2% at December 31, 2023.  The average balance of FHLB borrowings increased by $26.1 million from 2023 to 2024 to maintain liquidity needs.  New higher-rate borrowings taken out in 2024 increased the average rate by 16 basis points to 5.37% from 5.21% in 2023.  Average repurchase agreements balances increased $9.7 million or 8.4% from 2023 to 2024, while their average rate paid increased by 95 basis points due to the impact from the higher rate environment.  Subordinated and junior subordinated debt balances and average rates remained relatively flat from 2023 to 2024.

(1)
Changes to rate/volume are allocated to both rate and volume on a proportionate dollar basis.

(2)
The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% for all periods presented. Wesbanco believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES - LOANS

The provision for credit losses – loans is the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses – loans after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level considered appropriate to absorb lifetime expected losses for all portfolio loans. The provision for credit losses – loan commitments is the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for loan commitments to bring that allowance to a level considered appropriate to absorb lifetime expected losses on unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses - loans and loan commitments was $19.3 million in 2024 compared to $17.8 million in 2023 as a result of loan growth as well as changes in macroeconomic conditions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year, primarily increasing the allowance for loan losses. Furthermore, the increase to the provision was driven by an increase in individually evaluated loans, specifically within the CRE portfolio. Non-performing loans were 0.31% of total loans as of December 31, 2024, and increased from 0.23% of total loans at the end of 2023. Non-performing assets were 0.32% of total loans and other real estate and repossessed assets as of December 31, 2024, increasing from 0.24% at the end of 2023. Criticized and classified loans were 2.80% of total loans, increasing from 2.22% as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to downgrades within the CRE portfolio. Past due loans at December 31, 2024 were 0.47% of total loans, compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2023.  (Please see the Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses – Loans and Loan Commitments section of this MD&A for additional discussion).

Non-interest income is a significant source of revenue and an important part of Wesbanco’s results of operations, as it represented 21.1% and 20.0% of total revenue for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Wesbanco offers its customers a wide range of retail, commercial, investment and electronic banking services, which are viewed as a vital component of Wesbanco’s ability to attract and maintain customers, as well as providing additional fee income beyond normal spread-related income to Wesbanco. Non-interest income increased $7.5 million or 6.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in trust fees, service charges on deposits, mortgage banking income, and other income. The increases were slightly offset by decreases in net swap fee and valuation income, bank-owned life insurance and net gains on other real estate owned and other assets.

Trust fees increased $2.5 million or 9.0% in 2024 compared to 2023. Trust assets of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024, increased from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, trust assets include managed assets of $4.8 billion and non-managed (custodial) assets of $1.1 billion. Assets managed for the WesMark Funds, a proprietary group of mutual funds that is advised by Wesbanco Trust and Investment Services, were $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, and are included in managed assets.

Service charges on deposits increased $3.9 million or 14.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to an increase in transactional fee income from new products and services, including treasury management, as well as increased general consumer spending.

Net swap fee and valuation income, which includes fair value adjustments, decreased $1.0 million or 14.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease was specifically due to a decrease in the amount of new swaps originated and their associated swap fee income and was partially offset by positive fair value adjustments. In 2024, new swaps totaled $494.8 million in notional principal resulting in $4.9 million in fee income, compared to new swaps totaling $728.7 million in notional principal resulting in $9.0 million in fee income in 2023. Fair market value adjustments on swaps in 2024 totaled a positive $1.0 million as compared to a negative $2.1 million in 2023.

Bank-owned life insurance decreased $1.5 million or 13.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to a decrease in mortality benefits received.

Mortgage banking income increased $1.6 million or 61.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to more residential mortgages sold in the secondary market, as well as an associated wider gain-on-sale margin. In 2024, total mortgage production was $0.6 billion, which was a decrease of 13.0% from total production in 2023. In 2024, $307.8 million in mortgages were sold into the secondary market as compared to $293.4 million in 2023. Included in mortgage banking income is a loss of $0.1 million and a gain of $0.8 million from the fair value adjustments on mortgage loan commitments and related derivatives for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net gains on other real estate owned and other assets decreased $1.4 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to a $1.1 million gain recognized in 2023, from an asset previously written off in a prior year.

Other income increased $2.2 million or 33.6% in 2024 compared to 2023, due specifically to a $2.3 million gain from the transfer of certain liabilities for future pension payments to a third-party insurance company.  Please refer to Footnote 13, “Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information.

Non-interest expense in 2024, excluding restructuring and merger-related expenses, increased $9.3 million or 2.4% compared to 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were higher equipment and software costs, FDIC insurance, professional fees, and postage, supplies and other expenses. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in employee benefits, marketing, amortization of intangible assets, and ATM and electronic banking and interchange expenses. Restructuring and merger-related expenses were $6.4 million in 2024 and $3.8 million in 2023, and are described in more detail below.

Salaries and wages increased by $0.6 million or 0.3% in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to increased bonus expense, mid-year merit increases and lower deferred contra loan origination costs, and were slightly offset by lower salaries expense, stock compensation expense and commission expense.  Full time equivalent employees decreased due to efficiency improvements associated with the branch staffing models as well as the continuation of the branch optimization plans.

Employee benefits expense decreased by $0.8 million or 1.6% in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to decreases in health insurance expense and other benefit expenses, which were driven by lower staffing levels, and were slightly offset by increases in deferred compensation expense.

Equipment and software costs increased $4.6 million or 12.6% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to continuous improvements in technology and communication infrastructure, including the prior year ATM upgrades, which were phased in throughout 2023, general inflationary cost increases for existing service agreements and increased usage of digital banking services.

FDIC insurance increased $2.0 million or 16.1% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to an increase in both Wesbanco’s assessment rate and assessment base. The assessment rate increased from 7.8 basis points to 8.5 basis points throughout 2024. The assessment base increase is due to increases in Wesbanco’s balance sheet.

Marketing expenses decreased $1.4 million or 12.7% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to the reclassification of investor relations expense into professional fees for 2024 as well as the timing of marketing efforts causing a decrease in direct marketing and customer marketing incentives.

Restructuring and merger-related expenses in 2024 totaled $6.4 million, an increase from $3.8 million incurred in 2023. The $6.4 million of expenses in 2024 consisted of $3.5 million for the restructuring due to branch optimization and $2.9 million related to the Premier acquisition. The restructuring and merger-related expenses in 2023 totaling $3.8 million consisted of fixed asset writedowns, lease termination expenses and severance expenses associated with the closure of branches, back-office buildings and a restructuring of the residential mortgage department.

Professional fees increased $3.3 million or 20.9% in 2024 as compared to 2023. The lead drivers of the increase were legal fees, increased consumer loan, retail loan, and HELOC origination fees resulting from increases in loan volume, and higher other professional fees.

ATM and electronic banking interchange expenses decreased $1.1 million or 15.1% in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to cost savings resulting from the consolidation of third party card service providers, and were slightly offset by an increase in transaction volume.

Supplies, postage, and other operating expense increased $2.5 million or 9.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to higher costs and fees in support of loan growth and higher other miscellaneous expenses.

40

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes was $33.6 million for 2024, which is a $1.4 million decrease as compared to $35.0 million in 2023. The decrease in the provision for income taxes is due to a decrease in pre-tax income from 2023 to 2024, and is slightly offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from 18.1% in 2023 to 18.2% in 2024. The decrease in pre-tax income is primarily driven by lower net interest income and higher non-interest expense in 2024 as compared to 2023.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Total assets, deposits and shareholders' equity increased 5.5%, 7.3% and 10.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Total securities increased $6.3 million or 0.2% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, as investment runoff was reinvested in the purchase of new securities. Total portfolio loans increased $1.0 billion or 8.7% in 2024 driven by strong performance from our commercial and residential lending teams. Total deposits increased $1.0 billion or 7.3% from year end 2023 reflecting the benefit of deposit gathering and retention efforts by our retail and commercial teams. Reflecting the impact of a higher federal funds rate, there continued to be some mix shift in the composition of total deposits; however, total demand deposits continue to represent 54% of total deposits, with the non-interest bearing component representing 27%, which remains consistent with the percentage range since early 2020.

Deposit balances were also somewhat impacted by bonus and royalty payments from Marcellus and Utica shale energy companies in Wesbanco’s southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia markets. The increase in certificates of deposit of $495.2 million is primarily due to customers' preferences during the higher interest rate environment. Total borrowings decreased 15.2% or $263.6 million during 2024, as deposit growth increased and required less funding generated through FHLB borrowings.

Total shareholders’ equity increased $257.2 million or 10.2%, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the capital raise of $191.0 million, net income of $151.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and a $8.1 million other comprehensive gain exceeding the declaration of common and preferred shareholder dividends totaling $90.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of any one issuer, other than U.S. government sponsored entities and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of Wesbanco’s shareholders’ equity.

(2)
Total held-to-maturity debt securities are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of their allowance for credit losses totaling $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

(3)
Weighted average yields have been calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%.  

Total investment securities, which are a source of liquidity for Wesbanco as well as a contributor to interest income, decreased by $6.2 million or 0.2% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Throughout the year, the available-for-sale portfolio increased by $51.7 million or 2.4%, primarily due to $383.4 million in purchases and an $11.8 million decrease in unrealized losses, which were partially offset by $275.0 million in paydowns and $65.6 million in maturities and calls. The held-to-maturity portfolio decreased by $46.6 million or 1.0% due to maturities and calls of municipal securities. The weighted average yield of the portfolio increased 15 basis points from 2.52% at December 31, 2023 to 2.67% at December 31, 2024, primarily due to higher yields on purchased securities.

Total gross unrealized securities losses increased $3.4 million, from $438.3 million as of December 31, 2023 to $441.7 million at December 31, 2024. The increase in unrealized losses from December 31, 2023 was due to an increase in market rates throughout 2024 causing market prices to decrease on the investment portfolio. Wesbanco believes that none of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2024 require an allowance for credit losses. Please refer to Note 4, “Securities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Wesbanco does not have any investments in private mortgage-backed securities or

42

those that are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, nor does Wesbanco have any exposure to collateralized debt obligations or government-sponsored enterprise preferred stocks.

Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $223.8 million and $233.2 million, respectively. These net unrealized pre-tax losses represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to fixed yields in the available-for-sale portfolio, and on an after-tax basis are accounted for as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. Net unrealized pre-tax losses in the held-to-maturity portfolio, which are not accounted for in other comprehensive income, were $146.1 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $130.4 million as of December 31, 2023. With approximately 34% of the investment portfolio in the held-to-maturity category, the recent movement in interest rates does not have as much of an impact on other comprehensive income as that of the available-for-sale category.

Wesbanco uses prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non-binding) quotes from independent brokers, to measure the fair value of its securities. Wesbanco validates prices received from pricing services or brokers using a variety of methods, including, but not limited to: (1) comparison to secondary pricing services; (2) corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant benchmark indices; (3) review of pricing by personnel familiar with market liquidity and other market-related conditions; (4) review of pricing service methodologies; (5) review of independent auditor reports received from the pricing service regarding its internal controls; and (6) through review of inputs and assumptions used in pricing certain securities thinly-traded or with limited observable data points. The procedures in place provide management with a sufficient understanding of the valuation models, assumptions, inputs and pricing to reasonably measure the fair value of Wesbanco’s securities. For additional disclosure relating to fair value measurement, refer to Note 17, “Fair Value Measurement” in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco’s held-to-maturity debt portfolio are analyzed quarterly to determine if an allowance for current expected credit losses is warranted. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate expected credit losses on an individual security basis. The expected credit losses are adjusted quarterly and are recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra asset. The losses are recorded on the income statement in the provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities, which was $8.4 million and $8.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Held-to-maturity investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies as well as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, have no historical evidence supporting expected credit losses; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at zero, and will monitor this assumption in the future for any economic or governmental policies that could impact this assumption. Wesbanco recorded an allowance on held-to-maturity debt securities of $0.1 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Equity securities, of which a portion consists of investments in various mutual funds held in grantor trusts formed in connection with a key officer and director deferred compensation plan, are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses due to fair value fluctuations on equity securities are included in net securities gains or losses. For those equity securities relating to the key officer and director deferred compensation plan, the corresponding change in the obligation to the employee is recognized in employee benefits expense.

Cost-method investments consist primarily of FHLB of Pittsburgh stock totaling $48.2 million and $62.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

LOANS AND LOAN COMMITMENTS

Loans represent Wesbanco’s largest balance sheet asset classification and the largest source of interest income. Commercial loans include CRE, which is further differentiated between land and construction, and improved property loans; as well as C&I loans that may or may not be secured by real estate. Retail loans include residential real estate mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”), and loans for other consumer purposes.

Loan commitments, which are not reported on the balance sheet, represent available balances on commercial and consumer lines of credit, commercial letters of credit, deposit account overdraft protection limits, certain loan guarantee contracts, and approved commitments to extend credit. Approved commitments, which have been accepted by the customer, are included net of any Wesbanco loan balances that are to be refinanced by the new commitment. However, typically not all approved commitments will ultimately be funded.

Loans and loan commitments are summarized in Table 11.

Total portfolio loans increased $1.0 billion or 8.7% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, due to strong growth throughout the year in both the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios. Commercial real estate loans increased $761.2 million or 11.6%, as improved property increased 8.4% and land and construction loans increased 28.1%. Commercial and industrial loans increased $116.6 million or 7.0%. Retail loans also improved throughout the year, as residential real estate loans increased $81.5 million or 3.3% and home equity loans increased $86.9 million or 11.8%, while consumer loans decreased $28.3 million or 12.3%. Portfolio loans are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of deferred loan fees and costs and discounts on purchased loans. The net deferred loan costs were $11.9 million and $11.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Wesbanco conducts a deferred loan cost study to determine the allowable costs to be deferred over the life of the loan. Wesbanco’s deferred costs have continued to increase at a faster rate than the related customer deferred fee income causing the balance of the deferred loan costs to outweigh the deferred loan fees, primarily from home equity lines of credit, which have little fee income. Purchased loan discounts from acquisitions included in the portfolio loan balances were $10.5 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Loan accretion included in interest income on loans acquired from prior acquisitions was $3.1 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

CRE loans at December 31, 2024 represent a significant component of the loan portfolio at 57.9%, an increase of 1.5% as compared to CRE balances at December 31, 2023. CRE—land and construction loan balances increased $296.2 million or 28.1% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, while CRE—improved property loans increased $465.0 million or 8.4% during the same period.

C&I loans increased $116.6 million or 7.0% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The availability under lines of credit within C&I loans decreased slightly from 67.6% at December 31, 2023 to 65.1% of total C&I revolving lines of credit exposure as of December 31, 2024.

Residential real estate mortgage loans increased $81.5 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Wesbanco retained approximately 50% of mortgages by dollar volume originated in 2024 for the portfolio compared to 57% in 2023. Wesbanco sold more loans in 2024 as compared to 2023 as margins were reduced on fixed rate mortgage loans due to competitive pressures in the marketplace during the higher interest rate environment.

46

HELOC loans increased $86.9 million or 11.8% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Consumer loans decreased $28.3 million or 12.3% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.

Total loan commitments increased $39.6 million or 0.8% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Commitments in the C&I portfolio increased $119.4 million or 7.6% and $63.9 million or 6.0% in the HELOC portfolio, while CRE commitments decreased $124.1 million or 8.5% and residential real estate commitments decreased $20.4 million or 11.0%.

Geographic Distribution
 —Wesbanco extends credit primarily within the market areas where it has branch offices, markets adjacent thereto, or markets that have a loan production office. Loans outside of these markets are generally only made to established customers that have other business relationships with Wesbanco in its markets. Loans outside of Wesbanco’s markets represented approximately 6% of total loans at December 31, 2024 and 4% at December 31, 2023. These loans consist primarily of C&I, CRE-improved property and land and construction loans, residential real estate loans for second residences or vacation homes, consumer purpose lines of credit to wealth management customers, and automobile loans to family members of local customers.

The geographic distribution of the loan portfolio, excluding deposit overdraft limits and loans held for sale, is summarized in Table 12.

CREDIT RISK

The risk that borrowers will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations is inherent in all lending activities. Repayment risk can be impacted by external events such as adverse economic conditions, social and political influences that impact entire industries or major employers, individual loss of employment or other personal calamities and changes in interest rates. This inherent risk may be further exacerbated by the terms and structure of each loan as well as potential concentrations of risk. The primary goal of managing credit risk is to minimize the impact of all of these factors on the quality of the loan portfolio.

Credit risk is managed through the initial underwriting process as well as through ongoing monitoring and administration of the portfolio. Credit policies establish standard underwriting guidelines for each type of loan and require an appropriate evaluation of the credit characteristics of each borrower. This evaluation focuses on the sufficiency and sustainability of the primary source of repayment, the adequacy of collateral, if any, as a secondary source of repayment, potential for guarantor support, as a tertiary source of repayment and other factors unique to each type of loan that may increase or mitigate their risk. The manner and degree of monitoring and administration of the portfolio varies by type and size of loan.

Credit risk is also managed by closely monitoring delinquency levels and trends and initiating collection efforts at the earliest stage of delinquency. Wesbanco also monitors general economic conditions, including unemployment, housing activity and real estate values in its markets. Underwriting standards are modified when appropriate based on market conditions, the performance of one or more loan categories, and other external factors. An independent loan review function also performs periodic reviews of the portfolio to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of underwriting, loan documentation and portfolio administration.

Each category of loans contains distinct elements of risk that impact the manner in which those loans are underwritten, structured, documented, administered and monitored. Customary terms and underwriting practices, together with specific risks associated with each category of loans and Wesbanco’s processes for managing those risks are discussed in the remainder of this section.

Commercial Loans 
—The commercial portfolio consists of loans to a wide range of business enterprises of varying size. Many commercial loans often involve multiple loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers, therefore the potential for loss on any single transaction can be significantly greater for commercial loans than for retail loans. Commercial loan risk is mitigated by limiting total credit exposure to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries and geographic markets and by requiring appropriate collateral or guarantors.

Commercial loans are monitored for potential concentrations of loans to any one borrower or group of related borrowers. At December 31, 2024 Wesbanco’s legal lending limit to any single borrower or their related interests approximated $295 million. The ten largest commercial relationships combined ranged from $806 million to $930 million during 2024.  There were 23 relationships that exceeded $50 million at December 31, 2024. These large relationships generally consist of more than one loan to a borrower or their related entities and often have different primary repayment sources. The single largest relationship exposure approximated $121 million at December 31, 2024 and consists of multiple loans to a business relationship for residential real estate and land development in the real estate investment sector. The exposure is composed of a number of separate projects in various Kentucky markets that are at differing stages of development.

Commercial loans, including renewals and extensions of maturity, are approved within a framework of individual lending authorities based on the total credit exposure of the borrower. Loans with credit exposure up to $300 thousand are based on scoring system. Loans with credit exposure greater than $300 thousand require the approval of a commercial banking executive or credit officer, and credit exposures greater than $1.5 million require approval of a credit officer that is not responsible for loan origination. Credit exposures greater than $25 million require approval of a centralized credit committee comprised of senior and executive management, credit officers, directors, and certain other non-voting qualified persons that are not responsible for loan origination. Underwriters and credit officers do not receive incentive compensation based on loan origination volume. Commercial banking executives receive incentive compensation based on multiple factors that include loan origination, net growth in outstanding loan balances, fees, credit quality and portfolio administration requirements.

CRE – land and construction consists of loans to finance land for development, investment, use in a commercial business enterprise, agricultural or minerals extraction, construction of residential dwellings for resale, multi-family apartments and other commercial buildings that may be owner-occupied or income-generating investments for the owner. Construction loans generally are made only when Wesbanco also commits to the permanent financing of the project, has a takeout commitment from another lender for the permanent loan or the loan is expected to be repaid from the sale of subdivided property. However, even if Wesbanco has a takeout commitment, construction loans are underwritten as if Wesbanco will retain the loan upon completion of construction. In recent years, many construction loans that did not have a takeout commitment when the loan originated have been sold or refinanced in the secondary market immediately upon completion of construction, at times, resulting in significant unscheduled loan payoffs.

48

CRE – land and construction loans require payment of interest-only during the construction period, with initial terms ranging from six months up to three years for larger, multiple-phase projects, such as residential housing developments and large scale commercial projects. Interest rates are often fully-floating based on an appropriate index, but may be structured in the same manner as the interest rate that will apply to the permanent loan upon completion of construction. Interest during the construction period is typically included in the project costs and therefore is often funded by loan advances. Advances are monitored to ensure that the project is at the appropriate stage of completion with each advance and that interest reserves are not exhausted prior to completion of the project. In the event a project is not completed within the initial term, the loan is re -underwritten at maturity, but interest beyond the initial term must be paid by the borrower and in some instances an additional interest reserve is required as a condition of extending the maturity. Upon completion of construction, the loan is converted to permanent financing and reclassified to CRE—improved property.

CRE – improved property loans consist of loans to purchase or refinance owner-occupied and investment properties. Owner-occupied CRE consists of loans to borrowers in a diverse range of industries and property types. Investment properties include multi-family apartment buildings, 1-to-4 family rental units, lodging and various types of commercial buildings that are rented or leased to unrelated parties of the owner.

CRE – improved property loans generally require monthly principal and interest payments based on amortization periods ranging from ten to thirty years depending on the type, age and condition of the property. Loans with amortization periods exceeding twenty years typically also have a maturity date or call option of ten years or less. Interest rates are generally adjustable after a fixed period ranging from one to five years based on an appropriate index of comparable duration. Interest rates may also be fixed for longer than five years and certain loans from acquisitions may have longer initial fixed rate terms. For certain larger loans, the borrower may be required to enter into an interest rate derivative contract that converts Wesbanco’s rate to an adjustable rate.

C&I loans consist of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable, inventory and other general business purposes; term loans to finance fixed assets other than real estate, and letters of credit to support trade, insurance or governmental requirements for a variety of businesses. Most C&I borrowers are privately-held companies with annual sales up to $100 million.

C&I term loans secured by equipment and other types of collateral generally require monthly principal and interest payments based on amortization periods up to ten years depending on the estimated useful life of the collateral, with interest rates that may be fixed for the term of the loan (potentially via an interest rate derivative contract) or adjustable after a fixed period ranging from one to seven years based on an appropriate index.

Commercial lines and letters of credit are generally categorized as C&I but may also be categorized as CRE—improved property loans or CRE—land and construction if they are secured primarily by real estate. Lines of credit typically require payment of interest-only with principal due on demand or at maturity. Interest rates on lines of credit are generally fully-adjustable based on an appropriate short-term index. Letters of credit typically require a periodic fee with principal and interest due on demand in the event the beneficiary of the letter requests an advance on the commitment. Lines of credit may also include a fee based on the amount of the line that is not advanced. Lines and letters of credit are generally renewable or may be cancelled annually by Wesbanco, but may also be committed for up to three years for certain small business lines and certain letters of credit. Letters of credit may also require Wesbanco to notify the beneficiary within a specified time in the event Wesbanco does not intend to renew or extend the commitment.

The primary factors considered in underwriting CRE—land and construction loans are the overall viability of each project, the experience and financial capacity of the developer or builder to successfully complete the project, market absorption rates and property values. These loans also have the unique risk that the developer or builder may not complete the project, or not complete it on time or within budget. Risk is generally mitigated by extending credit to developers and builders with established reputations who operate in Wesbanco’s markets and have the liquidity or other resources to absorb unanticipated increases in the cost of a project or longer than anticipated absorption, periodically inspecting construction in progress, and disbursing the loan at specified stages of completion. Certification of completed construction by a licensed architect or engineer and performance and payment bonds may also be required for certain types of projects. Since speculative projects are inherently riskier, Wesbanco may require a specified percentage of pre-sales for land and residential development or pre-lease commitments for investment property before construction can begin.

The primary factors that are considered in underwriting investment real estate are the debt service coverage calculation, the net rental income generated by the property, the composition of the tenants occupying the property, and the terms of leases, all of which may vary depending on the specific type of property. Other factors that are considered include the overall financial capacity of the investors and their experience owning and managing investment property.

Repayment of owner-occupied loans must come from the cash flow generated by the occupant’s commercial business. Therefore, the primary factors that are considered in underwriting owner-occupied CRE and C&I loans are the debt service coverage calculation, the historical and projected earnings, cash flow, capital resources, liquidity and leverage of the business. Other factors that are considered for their potential impact on repayment capacity include the borrower’s industry, competitive advantages and disadvantages, demand for the business’ products and services, business model viability, quality, experience and depth of management, and external influences that may impact the business such as general economic conditions and social or political changes.

The type, age, condition and location of real estate as well as any environmental risks associated with the property are considered for both owner-occupied and investment CRE. Environmental risk is mitigated by requiring assessments performed by qualified inspectors whenever the current or previous uses of the property or any adjacent properties are likely to have resulted in contamination of the property financed. Overall risk is further mitigated by requiring borrowers to have adequate down payments or cash equity, thereby limiting the loan amount in relation to the lower of the cost or the market value of the property, unless there are sufficient mitigating factors that would reduce the risk of a higher loan-to-value. Market values are determined by obtaining current appraisals or evaluations, whichever is appropriate or required by banking regulations based on the amount financed prior to the loan being made. New appraisals or evaluations may be obtained throughout the life of each loan to more accurately assess current market value when the initial term of a loan is being extended, market conditions indicate that the property value may have declined, and/or the primary source of repayment is no longer adequate to repay the loan under its original terms.

CRE loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are generally limited to the maximum percentages prescribed by Wesbanco credit policy or banking regulations, which range from 65% for unimproved land to 85% for improved commercial property. Regulatory guidelines also limit the aggregate of CRE loans that exceed prescribed LTV ratios to 30% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital. The aggregate of all CRE loans and loan commitments that exceeded the regulatory guidelines approximated $237 million or 12% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024, compared to $165 million or 9% at December 31, 2023. Regardless of credit policy or regulatory guidelines, lower LTV ratios may be required for certain types of properties or when other factors exist that increase the risk of volatility in market values such as single or special-use properties that cannot be easily converted to other uses or may have limited marketability. Conversely, higher LTV ratios may be acceptable when there are other factors to adequately mitigate the risk.

The type and amount of collateral for C&I loans varies depending on the overall financial strength of the borrower, the amount and terms of the loan, and available collateral or guarantors.  The level of pledged collateral can vary from unsecured to fully secured with various types of collateral.  Unsecured credit is only extended to those borrowers and/or guarantors that exhibit consistently strong repayment capacity and the financial condition to withstand a temporary decline in their operating cash flows.  Unsecured loans totaled $195 million and $210 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans can be secured by bank deposit

50

accounts, marketable securities, working capital assets (accounts receivable and inventory), equipment or owner occupied real estate.  Bank deposits and marketable securities represent the lowest risk.  Marketable securities are subject to changes in market value and are monitored regularly by the bank to ensure they remain appropriately margined.  Collateral other than equipment or real estate that fluctuates with business activity, such as accounts receivable and inventory, may also be subject to regular reporting and certification by the borrower and, in some instances, independent inspection and verification by Wesbanco.  Loans secured by equipment or real estate may be subject to receipt of third party appraisals.  Although loans can be collateral type-specific, they can also be secured by multiple property types and/or a blanket lien may be placed on all of a borrower’s assets.

Most commercial loans are originated directly by Wesbanco. Participation in loans originated by other financial institutions represents $860 million or 7.1% of total commercial loan exposure at December 31, 2024, compared to $871 million or 7.7% at December 31, 2023. Included in this total are Shared National Credits of approximately $116 million at December 31, 2024 and $178 million at December 31, 2023. Shared National Credits are defined as loans in excess of $100 million that are financed by three or more lending institutions. Wesbanco performs its own customary credit evaluation and underwriting before purchasing loan participations. The credit risk associated with these loans is similar to that of loans originated by Wesbanco, but additional risk may arise from the limited ability to control the actions of the lead, agent or servicing institution.

The commercial portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk including by market, CRE – property type, C&I industry, loan type and loans affected by similar external factors. The breakdown of CRE – improved property includes 26% owner-occupied and 74% non-owner occupied.

Beginning in 2001 and revised in 2013, banks of a certain size are required to track C&I loan transactions designated as Highly Leveraged Transactions (“HLTs”).  Loans that meet the criteria must be of a certain size, for the purpose of a buyout, acquisition or capital distributions and meet certain leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2024, Wesbanco had $123.5 million or 1.0% of total commercial loan exposure designated as HLTs, as compared to $108.0 million or 1.0% as of December 31, 2023.

The bank is monitoring the office building portfolio, as remote work has continued to result in diminished need for dedicated office space. As of December 31, 2024, total exposure specific to land development and new development related to office buildings, improvements and renovation of existing structures, purchase of existing buildings and other related activities approximated $414 million or 3.4% of the total commercial loan exposure, as compared to $471 million or 4.2% of the total commercial loan exposure at December 31, 2023.  There is a potential risk for office loan losses to materialize as lease agreements begin to expire and companies reduce their footprint.

Represents Bank’s total risk-based capital.

Multi-family apartments represent the single largest category of commercial loans. Multi-family apartment exposure increased 6.5% from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024. This exposure represents 83.9% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024, down from 87.5% at December 31, 2023.

Construction represents the second largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $1.0 billion. Construction exposure increased 22.3% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This category represents 52.6% of risk-based capital, compared to 47.8% at December 31, 2023.  Construction-coded loans are broken down between 1-4 family homes built for sale, lot development and general trade.

Healthcare represents the third largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $998 million. Healthcare exposure increased 16.0% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This category represents 50.7% of risk-based capital, compared to 48.6% at December 31, 2023.

Real estate—shopping center represents the fourth largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $769 million. Real estate—shopping center exposure increased 18.0% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This category represents 39.1% of risk-based capital, compared to 36.8% at December 31, 2023.

Lodging represents the fifth largest category of commercial loan exposure with total exposure of $753 million. Lodging exposure increased 8.5% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This represents 38.3% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024, compared to 39.2% at December 31, 2023.

Services represents the sixth largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $747 million. Services increased 4.6% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This category represents 38.0% of risk-based capital, compared to 40.3% at December 31, 2023.

In addition to the methods in which Wesbanco monitors the CRE portfolio for possible concentrations of risk, the regulatory agencies use a two-tiered assessment to determine whether a bank has an overall concentration of CRE lending as a percentage of bank total risk-based capital. Loan balances used to determine compliance are based upon Call Report instructions and therefore do not necessarily match the balances displayed in Table 14. The first tier measures loans for land, land development, residential and commercial construction. This tier totals $1.4 billion or 72.4% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.2 billion or 65.5% at December 31, 2023. The regulatory guidance for the first tier is 100% of total risk-based capital. The second tier measures loans included in the first tier plus multi-family apartments and other commercial investment property. This tier totals $5.6 billion or 284.7% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024, compared to $5.0 billion or 285.1% at December 31, 2023. The regulatory guidance for the second tier is 300% of total risk-based capital. The regulatory agencies also consider whether a bank’s CRE portfolio

52

has increased by 50% or more within the prior thirty-six months of the assessment date. Total CRE exposure increased $1.5 billion or 36.4% for the thirty-six month period ended December 31, 2024.

Basel III requires banks to identify High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (“HVCRE”) loans in their portfolios. These loans are subject to 150% weighting in the risk-based capital calculation, effective January 1, 2015. These regulations require, among other things, that investment CRE loans for acquisition, development or construction that are not in permanent amortizing loan status, meet the statutory LTV guidelines, have a minimum contributed equity of 15% in cash, marketable securities or contributed land at appraised value, and the loan documentation must contain a requirement that the initial capital injection remain in the project until the loan has converted to permanent financing or is paid in full. Changes to the law in May 2018 eliminated certain CRE loan categories from being subject to the regulation, such as owner-occupied, changed contributed land value from cost to appraised value for the equity component and required only the initial capital to meet the 15% threshold remain in the project. The bank has approximately $160 million in HVCRE exposure representing 1.8% of total CRE exposure and 8.1% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2024. This compares to $173 million in HVCRE exposure representing 2.2% of total CRE exposure and 9.8% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2023.

Retail Loans
 —Retail loans are a homogenous group, generally consisting of standardized products that are smaller in amount and distributed over a larger number of individual borrowers. This group is comprised of residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans.

Residential real estate consists of loans to purchase, construct or refinance the borrower’s primary dwelling, second residence or vacation home. Residential real estate also includes approximately $16 million of 1-to-4 family rental properties at December 31, 2024, an increase from approximately $12 million at December 31, 2023. Wesbanco originates residential real estate loans for its portfolio as well as for sale in the secondary market. Portfolio loans also include loans to finance vacant land upon which the owner intends to construct a dwelling at a future date. The majority of portfolio loans require monthly principal and interest payments to amortize the loan with terms up to thirty years. Construction loans may only require interest payments during the construction period, which typically range from six to twelve months (but may be longer for larger residences) and will convert to principal and interest upon completion of construction. Loans for vacant land are generally five-year balloons based on a 20-year amortization and are refinanced when the owner begins construction of a dwelling. Interest rates on portfolio loans may be fixed for up to 30 years. Adjustable rate loans are based primarily on the Treasury Constant Maturity index and can adjust annually or in increments up to 15 years. Currently most 30-year and a portion of 15-year fixed-rate originations are sold into the secondary market.

HELOC loans are secured by first or second liens on a borrower’s primary residence or second home. HELOCs are generally limited to an amount which when combined with the first mortgage on the property, if any, does not exceed 90% of the market value. Maximum LTV ratios are also tiered based on the amount of the line and the borrower’s credit history. Most HELOCs originated prior to 2005 are available for draws by the borrower for up to fifteen years, at which time the outstanding balance is converted to a term loan requiring monthly principal and interest payments sufficient to repay the loan in not more than seven years. Most HELOCs originated from 2005 through 2013 are available to the borrower for an indefinite period as long as the borrower’s credit characteristics do not materially change, but may be cancelled by Wesbanco under certain circumstances. Generally, lines originated since 2013 have a 15 year draw period, a ten-year repayment period and also give borrowers the option to convert portions of the balance of their line into an installment loan requiring monthly principal and interest payments, with availability to draw on the line restored as the installment portions are repaid.

Consumer loans consist of installment loans originated directly by Wesbanco and indirectly through dealers to finance purchases of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, boats, and other recreational vehicles; home equity installment loans, unsecured home improvement loans, and revolving lines of credit that can be secured or unsecured. The maximum term for installment loans is generally eighty-four months for automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and boats; one hundred eighty months for travel trailers; one hundred twenty months for home equity/improvement loans; and sixty months if the loan is unsecured. Maximum terms may be less depending on age of collateral. In January 2018, the bank decided to no longer underwrite indirect loans for motorcycles, recreational vehicles, trailers, boats or off-road vehicles to reduce the overall risk profile of the portfolio. Revolving lines of credit are generally available for an indefinite period of time as long as the borrower’s credit characteristics do not materially change, but may be cancelled by Wesbanco under certain circumstances. Interest rates on installment obligations are generally fixed for the term of the loan, while lines of credit are adjustable daily based on the Prime Rate.

The primary factors that are considered in underwriting retail loans are the borrower’s credit history and their current and reasonably anticipated ability to repay their obligations as measured by their total debt-to-income ratio. Portfolio residential real estate loans are generally underwritten to secondary market lending standards using automated underwriting systems developed for the secondary market that rely on empirical data to evaluate each loan application and assess credit risk. The amount of the borrower’s down payment is an important consideration for residential real estate, as is the borrower’s equity in the property for HELOCs. It is common practice to finance the total amount of the purchase price of motor vehicles and other consumer products plus certain allowable additions for tax, title, service contracts and credit insurance.

Risk is further mitigated by requiring residential real estate borrowers to have adequate down payments or cash equity, thereby limiting the loan amount in relation to the lower of the cost or the market value of the property, unless there are sufficient mitigating factors that would reduce the risk of a higher loan-to-value. Market values are determined by obtaining current appraisals or evaluations, whichever is appropriate or required by banking regulations, based on the amount financed prior to the loan being made. New appraisals or evaluations are not obtained unless the borrower requests a modification or refinance of the loan, or there is increased dependence on the value of the collateral because the borrower is in default.

Wesbanco does not maintain current information about the industry in which retail borrowers are employed. While such information is obtained when each loan is underwritten, it often becomes inaccurate with the passage of time as borrowers change employment. Instead, Wesbanco estimates potential exposure based on consumer demographics, market share, and other available information when there is a significant risk of loss of employment within an industry or a significant employer in Wesbanco’s markets. To management’s knowledge, there are no concentrations of employment that would have a material adverse impact on the retail portfolio.

Most retail loans are originated directly by Wesbanco except for indirect consumer loans originated by automobile dealers and other sellers of consumer goods. Wesbanco performs its own customary credit evaluation and underwriting before purchasing indirect loans. The credit risk associated with these loans is similar to that of loans originated by Wesbanco, but additional risk may arise from Wesbanco’s limited ability to control a dealer’s compliance with applicable consumer lending laws. Indirect consumer loans represented $102 million or 52% of consumer loans at December 31, 2024 compared to $121 million or 53% at December 31, 2023.

Loans Held For Sale
 —Loans held for sale consist of residential real estate loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Credit risk associated with such loans is mitigated by entering into sales commitments with third party investors to purchase the loans when they are originated. This practice has the effect of minimizing the amount of such loans that are unsold and the interest rate risk at any point in time. Wesbanco generally does not service these loans after they are sold. While most loans are sold without recourse, Wesbanco may be required to repurchase loans under certain circumstances for contractual periods of generally up to one year or less. The number and principal balance of loans that Wesbanco has been required to repurchase has not been material and therefore reserves established for this exposure are not material.

Banks that have been acquired by Wesbanco serviced some of the residential real estate loans that were sold to the secondary market prior to being acquired. Although these loans are not carried as an asset on the balance sheet, Wesbanco continues to service these loans. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Wesbanco serviced loans for others aggregating approximately $26 million and $27 million, respectively. There was no remaining unamortized balance of mortgage servicing rights related to these loans at either December 31, 2024 or 2023.

54

CREDIT QUALITY

The quality of the loan portfolio is measured by various factors, including the amount of loans that are past due, required to be reported as non-performing, or are adversely graded in accordance with internal risk classifications that are consistent with regulatory adverse risk classifications. Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans. Non-performing assets also include other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed assets. Net charge-offs are also an important measure of credit quality. Wesbanco seeks to develop individual strategies for all assets that have adverse risk characteristics in order to minimize potential loss. However, there is no assurance such strategies will be successful and loans may ultimately proceed to foreclosure or other course of liquidation that does not fully repay the amount of the loan.

Past Due Loans
 —Loans that are past due but not reported as non-performing generally consist of loans that are between 30 and 89 days contractually past due. Certain loans that are 90 days or more past due also continue to accrue interest because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection. Earlier stage delinquency requires routine collection efforts to prevent them from becoming more seriously delinquent. Early stage delinquency represents potential future non-performing loans if routine collection efforts are unsuccessful.  Table 16 summarizes loans that are contractually past due 30 days or more, excluding non-accrual loans.

Loans past due 30 days or more and accruing interest increased $27.0 million, representing 0.47% of total loans at December 31, 2024, as compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2023. The overall low level of delinquency is the result of management’s continued focus on sound initial underwriting and timely collection of loans at their earliest stage of delinquency.

Non-Performing Assets
 —Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, OREO and repossessed assets.

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual when they become past due 90 days or more unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans also include consumer loans that were recently discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy but for which the borrower has continued to make payments for less than six consecutive months after the discharge.

OREO consists primarily of property acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure but may also include bank premises held for sale. Repossessed assets primarily consist of automobiles and other types of collateral acquired to satisfy defaulted consumer loans.

Non-accrual loans increased $12.9 million or 48.3% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.

OREO and repossessed assets totaled $0.9 million at December 31, 2024 as compared to $1.5 million at December 31, 2023. Wesbanco seeks to minimize the period for which it holds OREO and repossessed assets while also attempting to obtain a fair value from their disposition. Therefore, the sales price of these assets is dependent on current market conditions that affect the value of real estate, used automobiles, and other collateral. Repossessed assets are generally sold at auction within 60 days after repossession. Expenses associated with owning OREO and repossessed assets charged to other expenses were $0.3 million for both 2024 and 2023. Net gains on the disposition of OREO and repossessed assets are credited or charged to non-interest income and were $0.1 million in 2024 and immaterial in 2023.

Criticized and Classified Loans
 —Please refer to Note 5, “Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of internally-assigned risk grades for commercial loans and a summary of loans by grade. Wesbanco’s criticized loans are currently protected, but have weaknesses, which if not corrected, may be inadequately protected at some future date. Classified loan grades are equivalent to the classifications used by banking regulators to identify those loans that have significant adverse characteristics. A classified loan grade is assigned to all non-accrual commercial loans. Criticized and classified loans totaled $354.7 million or 3.9% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2024, compared to $258.7 million or 3.1% at December 31, 2023.

Charge-offs and Recoveries
 — Total charge-offs increased $8.7 million or 77.8% to $19.9 million, while total recoveries decreased $0.3 million to $6.2 million, resulting in an increase of $9.0 million in net charge-offs for 2024 compared to 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the charge-off of two loans totaling $6.1 million in 2024. Despite this increase, the net loan charge-off rates of 0.11% and 0.04% of total average loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are consistent with continued overall low levels of non-performing loans. Table 18 summarizes charge-offs and recoveries as well as net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans for each category of the loan portfolio.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

As of December 31, 2024, the total allowance for credit losses – loans and commitments was $144.9 million, of which $138.8 million relates to loans and $6.1 million relates to loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses – loans was 1.10% of total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2024, compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2023.

 The allowance for credit losses - loans individually-evaluated increased $12.1 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 due to an individually-evaluated loan analysis completed on certain classified commercial real estate loans. The allowance for credit losses-loans collectively-evaluated decreased from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 by $4.0 million.

 The allowance for credit losses - loan commitments was $6.1 million at December 31, 2024 as compared to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The allowance for credit losses by loan category, presented in Note 5, “Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses” of the Consolidated Financial Statements, summarizes the impact of changes in various factors that affect the allowance for credit losses in each segment of the portfolio.  The allowance for credit losses under CECL is calculated utilizing the probability of default ("PD")/ loss given default ("LGD"), which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, portfolio mix and loan growth. At December 31, 2024, the primary drivers of the allowance were loan growth,

57

macroeconomic variables and prepayment speeds, as well as changes in qualitative factors for distressed industries, the current interest rate environment and changes in the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan categories. The forecast was based upon a probability weighted approach which is designed to incorporate loss projections from a baseline, upside and downside economy. Due to the nonlinearity of credit losses to the economy, the asymmetry is best captured by evaluating multiple economic scenarios through a probability weighted approach. At year-end, Wesbanco applied a one-year forecast and immediately reverted to historical losses. The national unemployment rate was projected to be 4.6% as of December 31, 2024 and subsequently increase to an average of 4.9% over the remainder of the one-year forecast period.

Table 19 summarizes the allowance together with selected relationships of the allowance and provision for credit losses to total loans and certain categories of loans.

The allowance consists of specific reserves for certain individually-evaluated loans, if any, and a general reserve for all other loans. Commercial loans, including CRE and C&I, that have other unique characteristics are tested individually for potential credit losses.  Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any. The evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies pertaining to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for collectively-evaluated loans is comprised of factors based on both historical loss experience and other qualitative factors. The allowance for collectively-evaluated loans decreased $4.0 million or 3.2% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 due to changes in macroeconomic factors, specifically the yield curve, changes in portfolio mix and changes in qualitative adjustments. The allowance for individually-evaluated loans was $17.8 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.1 million from December 31, 2023. The allowance for loan commitments decreased $2.5 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.

Please refer to Note 5, “Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses applicable to each category of loans. Changes in the allowance for all categories of loans also reflect the net effect of changes in historical loss rates, loan balances, specific reserves and management’s judgment with respect to the impact of qualitative factors on each category of loans. A decrease in the allowance for a particular loan category generally reflects either lower loan balances, historical loss rate changes or reductions in non-performing and/or classified commercial loans. Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated as described in Table 20, the total allowance is available to absorb losses in any category of loans. However, differences between management’s estimation of expected future losses and actual incurred losses in subsequent periods may necessitate future adjustments to the provision for credit losses. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb expected future losses at December 31, 2024.

Deposits, which represent Wesbanco’s primary source of funds, are offered in various account forms at various rates through Wesbanco’s 181 financial centers, as of December 31, 2024, in West Virginia, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky, and southern Indiana. The FDIC insures all deposits up to $250,000 per account.

Total deposits increased $965.0 million or 7.3% in 2024 primarily reflecting the benefit of deposit gathering and retention efforts by the retail and commercial teams. Money market and interest-bearing demand deposits increased 20.4% and 8.9%, respectively, while savings accounts and non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased 5.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Deposit balances were also somewhat impacted by bonus and royalty payments from Marcellus and Utica shale energy companies in Wesbanco’s southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia markets totaling $94.0 million and $104.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Money market deposits were influenced through Wesbanco’s increased participation in the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS
®
) money market deposits program. ICS
®
 reciprocal balances totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023.  ICS
®
 one-way buys totaled $200.6 million at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Certificates of deposit increased $495.2 million, reflecting the significant increase in the federal funds rate and the continued remix from non interest-bearing demand deposits into certificates of deposit. The increase was also impacted by higher offered rates on certain maturing certificates of deposit. Wesbanco does not generally solicit brokered or other deposits out-of-market or over the internet, but does participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (“CDARS
®
”) program. CDARS
®
 balances totaled $49.8 million in outstanding balances at December 31, 2024, none of which represented one-way buys, compared to $48.4 million in total outstanding balances at December 31, 2023, of which $10.6 million represented one-way buys. Certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 were approximately $442.8 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $223.4 million at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more were approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $628.5 million at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit totaling approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024 with a cost of 4.09% are scheduled to mature within the next year. The average rate on certificates of deposit increased 180 basis points from 1.83% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 3.63% in 2024, with a similar increase experienced for jumbo certificates of deposit. Wesbanco will continue to focus on its core deposit strategies and improving its overall mix of transaction accounts to total deposits, which includes offering special promotions on certain certificates of deposit maturities and savings products based on competition, sales strategies, liquidity needs and wholesale borrowing costs.

Borrowings are a significant source of funding for Wesbanco in addition to deposits. During 2024, FHLB borrowings decreased $350.0 million from December 31, 2023, as $1.5 billion in maturities were partially offset by $1.2 billion in new advances. The average cost in 2024 of maturing and paid-off FHLB borrowings was 5.57%, compared to the average cost of 5.62% for new borrowings in 2024.

Wesbanco is a member of the FHLB system. The FHLB system functions as a borrowing source for regulated financial institutions that are engaged in residential and commercial real estate lending along with securities investing. Wesbanco uses term FHLB borrowings as a general funding source and to more appropriately match interest maturities for certain assets. FHLB borrowings are secured by blanket liens on certain residential and other mortgage loans with a market value in excess of the outstanding borrowing balances. The terms of the security agreement with the FHLB include a specific assignment of collateral that requires the maintenance of qualifying mortgage and other types of loans as pledged collateral with unpaid principal amounts in excess of the FHLB advances, when discounted at certain pre-established percentages of the loans’ unpaid balances. FHLB stock, which is recorded at cost of $48.2 million at December 31, 2024, is also pledged as collateral for these advances. Wesbanco’s remaining maximum borrowing capacity, subject to the collateral requirements noted, with the FHLB at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was estimated to be approximately $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.  Wesbanco can also use a portion of its maximum borrowing capacity to acquire FHLB letters of credit, which in some jurisdictions can be used to collateralize Wesbanco's public fund deposits.

Other short-term borrowings, which may consist of federal funds purchased, callable repurchase agreements or overnight sweep checking accounts increased $86.2 million to $192.1 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $105.9 million at December 31, 2023 due to moving certain customer relationships to interest-bearing demand deposits. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding federal funds purchased.

Subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt consist of $131.0 million of junior subordinated debt issued through eleven capital trusts, which are all wholly-owned trust subsidiaries formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities ("Trust Preferred Securities") and lending the proceeds to Wesbanco.  Subordinated debentures totaling $148.3 million (net of issuance costs) and issued in March 2022, have a fixed rate of 3.75% for the first five years and a floating rate for the next five years at Three Month SOFR plus a spread of 1.787%.  In 2023, Wesbanco completed a partial repurchase and cancellation of junior subordinated debt, which consisted of $3.1 million of Oak Hill Capital Trust 4, at a discount of $0.7 million.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Shareholders’ equity increased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2024 from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from a private placement of Wesbanco common shares that closed on August 1, 2024.
