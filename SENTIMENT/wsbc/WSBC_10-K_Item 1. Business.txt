LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity is defined as a financial institution’s capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet its obligations. An institution’s obligations, and the funding sources to meet them, depend significantly on its business mix, balance sheet structure, and the cash flows of its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Institutions confront various internal and external situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk including funding mismatches, market constraints on funding sources, contingent liquidity events, changes in economic conditions, and exposure to credit, market, operation, legal and reputation risk. Wesbanco actively manages liquidity risk through its ability to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand, unexpected outflows in deposits and other borrowings as well as to take advantage of market opportunities and meet operating cash needs. This is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of securities, sufficient borrowing capacity and a stable core deposit base. Liquidity is centrally monitored by Wesbanco’s ALCO with direct oversight from the Board of Directors ("BOD").

Wesbanco determines the degree of required liquidity by the relationship of total holdings of liquid assets to potential funding needs to meet unexpected deposit losses and/or loan demands. The ability to quickly convert assets to cash at a minimal loss is a primary function of managing Wesbanco’s investment portfolio. Wesbanco believes its cash flow from the loan portfolio, the investment portfolio, and other sources adequately meet its liquidity requirements. Wesbanco’s net loans-to-assets ratio was 67.0% and deposit balances funded 77.4% of total assets at December 31, 2024.

(1) Projected prepayments are based on current prepayment speeds.

Deposit cash flows are another principal factor affecting overall Wesbanco liquidity.  Deposits totaled $14.1 billion at December 31, 2024. Deposit cash flows are impacted by current interest rates, products and rates offered by Wesbanco versus various forms of competition, as well as customer behavior. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024, with a weighted average cost of 4.09%, which includes jumbo regular certificates of deposit totaling $920.3 million with a weighted-average cost of 4.37%, and jumbo CDARS® certificates of deposit of $44.7 million with a weighted-average cost of 4.15%.

Uninsured deposits, as reported for regulatory purposes, totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2024, or 33% of total deposits.  Uninsured deposits include $1.5 billion of public funds deposits that are over the FDIC-insured limit.  Wesbanco secures these public funds deposits by pledging investment securities with a market value at or above the deposit balance.  Excluding these public funds, at December 31, 2024, uninsured deposits were $3.1 billion, or 22% of total deposits.

Wesbanco maintains a line of credit with the FHLB as an additional funding source. Available credit with the FHLB approximated $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  The FHLB requires securities to be specifically pledged to the FHLB and maintained in a FHLB-approved custodial arrangement if the member wishes to include such securities in the maximum borrowing capacity calculation.  Wesbanco has elected not to specifically pledge to the FHLB unpledged securities.  Wesbanco can also use this line of credit for pledging collateral to cover public funds deposits, as an alternative to pledging securities from the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2024, the Bank had unpledged available-for-sale securities with an estimated fair value of $307.8 million, or 14.0% of the total available-for-sale portfolio. A portion of these securities could be sold for additional liquidity, or such securities could be pledged to secure additional FHLB borrowings.  Approximately 61% of the total market value of the investment portfolio is pledged to public deposit customers, as public deposit balances have increased significantly through the several

62

acquisitions made since 2015.  As a result of this growth, Wesbanco is monitoring exposure to public funds deposits in relation to pledging requirements and providing insured cash sweep ("ICS") deposits via IntraFi® as a solution for a portion of new and existing public fund depositors.  In addition, at December 31, 2024, the Bank had unpledged held-to-maturity securities with an estimated fair value of $711.6 million. Approximately 97%, or $688.3 million of these securities are municipal securities, which can only be pledged in limited circumstances. Generally, these securities cannot be sold without tainting the remainder of the held-to-maturity portfolio.  If tainting occurs, all remaining securities with the held-to-maturity designation would be required to be reclassified as available-for-sale, and the held-to-maturity designation would not be available to Wesbanco for a period of time.

Wesbanco participates in the Federal Reserve Bank’s Borrower-in-Custody Program (“BIC”) whereby Wesbanco pledges certain consumer loans as collateral for borrowings. Wesbanco did not have any BIC borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024. Alternative funding sources may include the utilization of existing overnight lines of credit with third party banks totaling $235.0 million, none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2024, along with seeking other lines of credit, borrowings under repurchase agreement lines, increasing deposit rates to attract additional funds, accessing brokered deposits, or selling securities available-for-sale or certain types of loans.

Other short-term borrowings of $192.1 million at December 31, 2024 consisted of repurchase agreements or overnight sweep checking accounts for large commercial customers. Other short-term borrowings may also include federal funds purchased using the Federal Reserve's discount window or Lines of Credit with third party banks noted above. The overnight sweep checking accounts require U.S. Government securities to be pledged equal to or greater than the average deposit balance in the related customer accounts.

The principal sources of parent company liquidity are dividends from the Bank and $321.8 million in cash on hand. There are various legal limitations under federal and state laws that limit the payment of dividends from the Bank to the parent company. As of December 31, 2024, under FDIC and State of West Virginia regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, dividends of approximately $245.0 million from the Bank.  Management believes these are appropriate levels of cash for the parent company given the current environment.  Management continuously monitors the adequacy of parent company cash levels and sources of liquidity through the use of metrics that relate current cash levels to historical and forecasted cash inflows and outflows.

Wesbanco had outstanding commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On a historical basis, only a portion of these commitments will result in an outflow of funds. Please refer to Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Loans and Credit Risk” section of this MD&A for additional information.

Federal financial regulatory agencies have previously issued guidance to provide for sound practices for managing funding and liquidity risk and strengthening liquidity risk management practices. Wesbanco maintains a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling liquidity risk, which is fully integrated into its risk management process.  Management believes Wesbanco has sufficient current liquidity to meet current obligations to borrowers, depositors and others and that Wesbanco’s current liquidity risk management policies and procedures, as periodically reviewed and adjusted, adequately address this guidan
ce.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI
VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.

MARKET RISK

The primary objective of Wesbanco’s ALCO with direct oversight from the BOD is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters. This objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition and duration, market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions as well as liquidity risk.

Market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and bond prices.  Management considers interest rate risk to be Wesbanco’s most significant market risk. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. The consistency of Wesbanco’s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of Wesbanco's interest rate risk profile.  As interest rates change in the market, rates earned on interest rate-sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate-sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently.  Differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities, because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and/or the magnitude of rate changes, or due to the shape of the yield curve shifting over time.

Wesbanco’s ALCO is an executive management committee with Board representation, responsible for monitoring and managing interest rate risk within approved policy limits, utilizing earnings sensitivity simulation and economic value-at-risk models. These models are highly dependent on various assumptions, which change regularly as the balance sheet composition and market interest rates change. The key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed, reviewed and documented at least quarterly by the ALCO as well as provided to the Board.

The earnings sensitivity simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates. Forecasting changes in net interest income requires management to make certain assumptions regarding loan and security prepayment rates, call dates, changes to non-maturity deposit product betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates, which may not necessarily reflect the manner in which actual cash flows, yields, and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Assumptions are based on internally-developed models derived from institution specific data, current market rates and economic forecasts, and are internally back-tested and periodically validated by an independent third-party consultant. The net interest income sensitivity results presented in Table 1, “Net Interest Income Sensitivity,” assumes that the balance sheet composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the end of the period remains constant over the period being measured (otherwise known as a "static" balance sheet) and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected immediately and parallel across all tenors of the yield curve, regardless of the duration of the maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain, the simulation analysis may not be indicative of actual results, particularly in times of stress.  In addition, this analysis does not consider actions that management might employ in the future in response to changes in interest rates, as well as changes in earning asset and costing liability balances.

Interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve-month period, assuming immediate and sustained market interest rate increases and decreases of 100 - 400 basis points across the entire yield curve, as compared to a flat rate environment or base model.  Wesbanco’s current policy limits this exposure for the noted interest rate changes to a reduction of between 7.5% - 20%, or less, of net interest income from the stable rate base model over a twelve-month period.  The table below indicates Wesbanco’s interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming the above-noted interest rate changes, as compared to a base model.

Net interest income sensitivity changes are due to the impact of the current rate and yield curve environment on base case net interest income and the related calculation of immediate parallel rate shock changes in rising and falling rate scenarios. Additional differences typically result from changes in the various earning assets and costing liabilities mix and growth rates, as well as periodic updates of various modeling assumptions. Generally, interest bearing non-maturity deposit betas utilized in modeling have increased to 40% in both up and down interest rate shocks as the banking industry continues to remain in a high interest rate environment where funding cost pressures have persisted. Deposit betas, decay rates and loan prepayment speeds are adjusted periodically, but reviewed no less than quarterly in our models for non-maturity deposits and loans. Indicated model asset sensitivity in rising rate scenarios may be less than anticipated due to slower prepayment speeds, rate floors, below forecast loan yields, spread compression between new asset yields and funding costs, customer requests for negotiated rates, mortgage-related extension risk and other factors. In a decreasing rate environment, asset sensitivity may have greater impact on the margin than currently modeled as prepayment speeds increase, customers refinance or request rate reductions on existing loans, estimated deposit betas do not perform as modeled, or for other reasons not listed.

In addition to the aforementioned parallel rate shock earnings sensitivity simulation model, the ALCO also reviews a “dynamic” forecast scenario to project Wesbanco's "most likely" net interest income over a rolling two-year time period.  This forecast is updated at least quarterly, incorporating revisions and updated assumptions into the model for estimated loan and deposit growth, expected balance sheet re-mixing strategies, changes in forecasted interest rates for various indices and yield curves, competitive market spreads for various products and other assumptions not listed. Such modeling is directionally consistent with typical parallel rate shock scenarios, and it assists in predicting changes in forecasted outcomes and potential adjustments to management plans to assist in achieving earnings goals.

Wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity (“EVE”), which is defined as the market value of tangible equity in various rate scenarios.  Generally, changes in the economic value of equity relate to changes in various assets and liabilities, changes in the yield curve, as well as changes in loan prepayment speeds and deposit decay rates.  The following table presents these results and Wesbanco’s policy limits as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Changes in EVE sensitivity since year-end 2023 relate to the change in balance sheet composition and market interest rates and their impact upon the fair values of earning assets and costing liabilities:

The Bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and various correspondent banks, and may utilize these funding sources or interest rate swap strategies as necessary to lengthen liabilities, offset mismatches in various asset maturities and manage liquidity.  CDARS
®
 and ICS
®
 deposits also may be utilized for similar purposes for certain customers seeking higher-yielding instruments or maintaining deposit levels below FDIC insurance limits. Significant balance sheet strategies to assist in managing the net interest margin in the current interest rate environment include:

•
increasing total loans, particularly commercial and home equity loans that have variable or adjustable features;

•
adjusting the percentage of sales of longer-term residential mortgage loan production into the secondary market;

•
managing rates on interest bearing deposits and growing demand deposit account types to increase the relative portion of these account types to total deposits; 

•
employing back-to-back loan swaps for certain commercial loan customers desiring a term fixed rate loan equivalent, with the Bank receiving a variable rate;

•
adjusting terms for FHLB short-term maturing borrowings to balance asset/liability mismatches; or paying them off with excess liquidity  

•
using CDARS
®  
and ICS
®
 deposit programs to manage funding needs and overall liability mix, and

•
adjusting the size, mix or duration of the investment portfolio as part of liquidity and balance sheet management strategies

(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses - loans

Description of the Matter

The Company’s loan portfolio totaled $12.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and the associated allowance for credit losses - loans (ACL) was $138.8 million. As discussed in Note 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the ACL reflects the lifetime expected credit losses on the Company’s loan portfolio. The ACL is calculated utilizing the probability of default / loss given default approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model includes the forecast of national unemployment and interest rate spreads. The evaluation also considers qualitative factor adjustments such as economic trends and conditions, which includes adjustments related to distressed industries and the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the model’s quantitative results to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio. Additionally, commercial loans that have unique characteristics are evaluated individually for estimated credit losses and specific reserves are established when appropriate.
Auditing management’s ACL estimate was complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgement in evaluating management’s determination of the qualitative factor adjustments for distressed industries and the

69

level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments. We identified auditing the reasonableness of management’s determination of the qualitative factor adjustments for distressed industries and the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments in the ACL as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the ACL process, which included management’s review and approval controls designed to assess the appropriateness of the ACL methodology, reliability and accuracy of the data used in developing the qualitative factor adjustments, and the determination of the qualitative factor adjustments for distressed industries and the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments.
To test the qualitative factor adjustments for distressed industries and the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s methodology and assessed the basis for the adjustments and whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ACL. With the assistance of EY specialists, we evaluated the methodology and appropriateness of the qualitative factor adjustments for distressed industries and level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments. We tested the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the underlying data used to estimate the qualitative factors. We evaluated whether the qualitative factor adjustments were reasonable based on the changes in economic conditions and the loan portfolio in the period. Further, we performed an independent search for the existence of new or contrary information relating to risks impacting the distressed industries and the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan segments qualitative factors to validate that management’s considerations are appropriate. Additionally, we evaluated whether the overall ACL appropriately reflects expected losses in the loan portfolio by comparing it the Company’s historical loss data and to peer bank data. We also performed analytical procedures on the ACL, including coverage ratios and comparison to prior periods as well as prior economic cycles.

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation—
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Wesbanco and those entities in which Wesbanco has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Wesbanco determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make financial and operating decisions. Wesbanco consolidates voting interest entities in which it owns all, or at least a majority (generally, greater than 
50
%) of the voting interest.
Variable interest entities (“VIE”) are entities that in general either do not have equity investors with voting rights or that have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Wesbanco uses VIEs in various legal forms to conduct normal business activities. Wesbanco reviews the structure and activities of VIEs for possible consolidation.
A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. The company with a controlling financial interest, known as the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate the VIE. Wesbanco has 
eleven
 wholly-owned trust subsidiaries (collectively, the “Trusts”), for which it does not have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance nor the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive a benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. Accordingly, the Trusts and their net assets are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by Wesbanco to the Trusts (refer to Note 11, “Subordinated Debt and Junior Subordinated Debt”) and the common stock issued by the Trusts is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Wesbanco also owns non-controlling variable interests in certain limited partnerships for which it does not have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance nor the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive a benefit from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. These VIEs are not consolidated into Wesbanco’s financial statements because Wesbanco is not considered the primary beneficiary. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 8, “Investments in Limited Partnerships” for further detail.
Business Combinations—
 Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition.
Revenue Recognition—
 Interest income, net securities gains (losses) and bank-owned life insurance are not in scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For the revenue streams in scope of ASC 606, which include trust fees, service charges on deposits, net securities brokerage revenue, payment processing fees, electronic banking fees, net swap fee and valuation income, mortgage banking income and net gain or loss on sale of other real estate owned and other assets, there are no significant judgments related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
Trust fees:
 Fees are earned over a period of time between monthly and annually, per the related fee schedule. The fees are earned ratably over the period for investment, safekeeping and other services performed by Wesbanco. The fees are accrued when earned based on the daily asset value on the last day of the quarter.  In most cases, the fees are directly debited from the customer account. WesMark fees consist of investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees and are paid to Wesbanco by the WesMark mutual funds on a monthly basis for Wesbanco’s involvement with the management of the funds.
Service charges on deposits:
 There are monthly service charges for both commercial and personal banking customers, which are earned over the month per the related fee schedule based on the customers’ deposits. There are also transaction-based fees, which are earned based on specific transactions or customer activity within the customers’ deposit accounts. These are earned at the time the transaction or customer activity occurs. The fees are debited from the customer account.

76

Net securities brokerage revenue:
 Commission income is earned based on customer transactions and management of investments. The commission income from customers’ transactions is recognized when the transaction is complete and approved. Annuity commissions are earned based upon the carrier’s commission rate for the annuity product chosen by the investing customer.  The commission income from the management of investments over time is earned continuously over a quarterly period.
Payment processing fees:
 Payment processing fees are earned from the bill payment and electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) services provided under the name FirstNet. The fees are derived from both the individual consumer banking transactions and from businesses or service providers through monthly billing for total transactions occurring.  These fees are earned at the time the transaction or customer activity occurs.  The fees are debited from the customers’ deposit accounts or charged directly to the business or service provider.  Payment processing fees are recorded within other non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Digital banking income:
 Interchange and ATM fees are earned based on customer and ATM transactions. Revenue is recognized when the transaction is settled.
Net swap fee and valuation income:
 Fee income is earned when Wesbanco executes interest rate swaps and caps with its commercial banking customers.  These swaps and caps are economically hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps and caps that Wesbanco executes with a third party, generating the fee income.  The fee income is recognized when the swap or cap transaction is complete and approved by all parties.

Mortgage banking income:
 Income is earned when Wesbanco-originated loans are sold to an investor on the secondary market. The investor bids on the loans. If the price is accepted, Wesbanco delivers the loan documents to the investor. Once received and approved by the investor, revenue is recognized and the loans are derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prior to the loans being sold, they are classified as loans held for sale. Additionally, the changes in the fair value of the loans held for sale, loan commitments and related derivatives are included in mortgage banking income and are somewhat offset by any deferred direct origination costs, such as mortgage loan officer commissions.
Net gain or loss on sale of other real estate owned and other assets:
 Net gain or loss on other real estate owned is recorded when the property is sold to a third party and the Bank collects substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the transfer of the property.  Net gain or loss on other assets can include, among other things, the sale of fixed assets, the change in fair value of the underlying investments funded by Wesbanco’s Community Development Corporation (“Wesbanco CDC”) and residual income earned from the sale of Wesbanco’s debit card sponsorship program.  Gains or losses are recognized upon receipt of consideration and subsequent transfer of the property for fixed asset sales. The change in fair value of Wesbanco CDC investments occurs upon the change in the underlying investments as these are accounted for utilizing the equity method, and as such, are not within the scope of ASC 606.  Residual income from the sale of the debit card sponsorship program is recognized over time as per the signed agreement between Wesbanco and the buyer.
Cash and Cash Equivalents—
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, due from banks – interest bearing and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods.
Securities—

Equity securities:
 Equity securities, which include investments in various mutual funds held in grantor trusts formed in connection with the Company’s deferred compensation plan, are reported at fair value with the gains and losses included in non-interest income.
Available-for-sale debt securities:
 Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale. These securities may be sold at any time based upon management’s assessment of changes in economic or financial market conditions, interest rate or prepayment risks, liquidity considerations and other factors. These securities are stated at fair value, with the fair value adjustment, net of tax, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Held-to-maturity debt securities:
 Securities that are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held until their maturity are stated at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Transfers of debt securities into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held-to-maturity securities. Such amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the security. Certain securities with less than 
15
% of their original purchase price remaining or that have experienced measurable credit deterioration may be sold.
Cost method investments:
 Securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and for which Wesbanco does not exercise significant influence are carried at cost. Cost method investments consist primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Securities acquired in acquisitions are recorded at fair value with the premium or discount derived from the fair market value adjustment recognized into interest income on a level yield basis over the remaining life of the security.
Gains and losses:
 Net realized gains and losses on sales of securities are included in non-interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The gain or loss is determined as of the trade date. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded through other comprehensive income.

77

Amortization and accretion:
 Generally, premiums are amortized to call date and discounts are accreted to maturity, on a level yield basis.
Current expected credit losses (“CECL”):
  The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco’s held-to-maturity debt portfolio are analyzed quarterly for CECL. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate CECL on an individual security basis. The CECL calculated amount is adjusted quarterly and is recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra asset, with the losses recorded on the income statement within the provision for credit losses.  Because Wesbanco’s held-to-maturity investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, there is no historical evidence supporting the establishment of a CECL reserve; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at 
zero
, and will monitor this assumption in the future for any economical or governmental policies that could affect this assumption.
Available-for-sale debt security impairment:
 An available-for-sale debt security is considered impaired if its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis.  If Wesbanco intends to sell or will be required to sell the investment prior to recovery of cost, the entire impairment will be recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. If Wesbanco does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell impaired securities prior to the recovery of their cost, a review is conducted each quarter to determine if any portion of the impairment is due to credit losses. In estimating credit losses, Wesbanco first considers the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, evaluating any credit downgrades or other indicators of a potential credit problem, the type of security, either fixed or equity, and the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms. If there are no indications that the impairment is credit-related, the impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the impairment is considered to be credit-related based on management’s review of the various factors that indicate credit impairment, the amount of credit impairment is calculated using the present value of future expected cash flows. If the present value of future expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded, limited by the total unrealized loss on the security, and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-credit portion is calculated as the difference between the total unrealized loss and the credit portion of that loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income.
Loans and Loans Held for Sale — 
Loans originated by Wesbanco are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income including credit valuation adjustments, unamortized deferred loan fee income and loan origination costs. Interest is accrued as earned on loans except where doubt exists as to collectability, in which case accrual of income is discontinued. Loans originated and intended for sale are carried, in aggregate, at fair value. The use of a valuation model using quoted prices of similar instruments are significant observable inputs in arriving at the fair value of loans held for sale.

Loan origination fees and direct costs are deferred and accreted or amortized into interest income, as an adjustment to the yield, over the life of the loan using the level yield method, or an approximation thereof. When a loan is paid off, the remaining unaccreted or unamortized net origination fees or costs are immediately recognized into income.
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual when they are 
90
 days past due, unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection.  Loans may be returned to accrual status when a borrower has resumed paying principal and interest for a sustained period of at least 
six months
 and Wesbanco is reasonably assured of collecting the remaining contractual principal and interest.  Loans are returned to accrual status at an amount equal to the principal balance of the loan at the time of non-accrual status less any payments applied to principal during the non-accrual period.

A loan is considered non-performing, based on current information and events, if it is probable that Wesbanco will be unable to collect the payments of principal and interest when due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Wesbanco recognizes interest income on non-accrual loans on the cash basis only if recovery of principal is reasonably assured.  All non-accrual loans are considered non-performing loans.
Consumer loans are charged down to the net realizable value at 
120
 days past due for closed-end loans and 
180
 days past due for open-end revolving lines of credit.  Residential real estate loans are charged down to the net realizable value of the collateral at 
180
 days past due.  Commercial loans are charged down to the net realizable value when it is determined that Wesbanco will be unable to collect the principal amount in full.  Loans are reclassified to other assets at the net realizable value when foreclosure or repossession of the collateral occurs. Refer to the “Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets” policy below for additional detail.
Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty (“MBEFD”) —
 A modification of a loan for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is applicable when the loan modification results in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The most common modifications provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are expected to occur in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant-payment delays, or term extensions under ASC 310-10-50-39. Upon Wesbanco's adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") accounting was prospectively discontinued and economic concessions for modifications occurring on or after the adoption date are no longer measured. This accounting also results in the elimination of any existing economic concession related to a loan that was previously designated as a TDR if such loan is restructured on or after January 1, 2023. Due to the elimination of economic concessions

78

under ASU 2022-02, the standard may result in modified loans being subject to the new disclosures that would have not been considered concessions and not treated as TDRs.
When determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, consideration is given to any known default on any of its debt or whether it is probable that the debtor would be in payment default in the foreseeable future without the modification. Other indicators of financial difficulty include whether the debtor has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy, the debtor’s ability to continue as a going concern, or the debtor’s projected cash flow to service its debt (including principal & interest) in accordance with the contractual terms for the foreseeable future, without a modification.  If the payment of principal at original maturity is primarily dependent on the value of collateral, the current value of that collateral is considered in determining whether the principal will be paid.

The modification of a loan does not increase the allowance or provision for credit losses unless the loan is extended, or the loans are commercial loans that are individually evaluated for impairment, in which case a specific reserve is established pursuant to GAAP.  Portfolio segment loss history is the primary factor for establishing the allowance for residential real estate, home equity and consumer MBEFDs.
Non-accrual loans that are restructured remain on non-accrual, but may move to accrual status after they have performed according to the restructured terms for a period of time. MBEFDs on accrual status generally remain on accrual as long as they continue to perform in accordance with their modified terms.  MBEFDs may also be placed on non-accrual if they do not perform in accordance with the restructured terms. Loans may be removed from MBEFD status after they have performed according to the renegotiated terms for a period of time.

Acquired Loans—
 Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value and are classified into two categories; purchased financial instruments with more than insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”) loans, and loans with insignificant credit deterioration (“non-PCD”). PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans will have an allowance established on acquisition date, which is recognized in the current period provision for credit losses. For PCD loans, an allowance is recognized on day 1 by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the “Day 1 amortized cost”. There is no credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest.  Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.

PCD loans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326-20, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measure at Amortized Cost
, if, at acquisition, the loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination. At acquisition, Wesbanco considers several factors as indicators that an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. These factors include, but are not limited to, loans 
30
 days or more past due, loans with an internal risk grade of below average or lower, loans classified as non-accrual by the acquired institution, the materiality of the credit and loans that have been previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring.
Under ASC 326-20, a group of loans with similar risk characteristics can be assessed to determine if the pool of loans is PCD. However, if a loan does not have similar risk characteristics as any other acquired loan, the loan is individually assessed to determine if it is PCD. In addition, the initial allowance related to acquired loans can be estimated for a pool of loans if the loans have similar risk characteristics. Even if the loans were individually assessed to determine if they were PCD, they can be grouped together in the initial allowance calculation if they share similar risk characteristics. Since Wesbanco uses the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, the initial allowance calculation for PCD loans is calculated as the expected contractual cash shortfalls, discounted at the rate that equals the net present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be collected with the purchase price of the loan(s). If a PCD loan has an unfunded commitment at acquisition, the initial allowance for credit losses calculation reflects only the expected credit losses associated with the funded portion of the PCD loan. Expected credit losses associated with the unfunded commitment are included in the initial measurement of the commitment.
For PCD loans, the non-credit discount or premium is allocated to individual loans as determined by the difference between the loan’s amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance. The non-credit premium or discount is recognized into interest income on a level yield basis over the remaining expected life of the loan. For non-PCD loans, the interest and credit discount or premium is allocated to individual loans as determined by the difference between the loan’s amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance. The premium or discount is recognized into interest income on a level yield basis over the remaining expected life of the loan.
Allowance for Credit Losses—
 The allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected losses at the initial origination date.  Similarly, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities, represents expected losses on unfunded commitments. Fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses specific to loans, the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities are recognized in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of operations. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.  Management evaluates the

79

appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.

The allowance for credit loss calculation specific to loans is based on the loan’s amortized cost basis, which is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, deferred loan fees (costs) and acquired premium (discount) minus any write-downs. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses because the Company has a policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual, and also Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income. However, Wesbanco is reserving, as part of the allowance for credit losses, for accrued interest on loan modifications under the CARES Act due to the nature and timing of these deferrals.
The allowance for credit losses reflects the risk of loss on the loan portfolio. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes the probability of default (“PD”) / loss given default (“LGD”) approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rate spreads, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, portfolio mix and loan growth.  Management relies on macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable third party sources.  These forecasts can range from 
one
 to 
two years
, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management’s judgment of what can be reasonably supported.  The model reversion period can range from immediate to 
three years
.

The allowance for credit losses is calculated over the loan’s contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For commercial and industrial (“C&I”) revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the internal review date. For all other revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. The contractual term does not include expected extensions, renewals or modifications.

The loan portfolio is segmented based on the risk profiles of the loans. Commercial loans are segmented between commercial real estate (“CRE”), which are collateralized by real estate, and C&I, which are typically utilized for general business purposes. CRE is further segmented between land and construction (“LCD”) and improved property, which are generally loans to purchase or refinance owner occupied or non-owner occupied investment properties. LCD loans have a unique risk that the developer or builder may not complete the project or not complete it on time or within budget. Improved property loans are reviewed for risk based on the underlying real estate property such as rental or owner income, appraisal value and other current lease terms, which affect debt service coverage and loan to value. Retail loans are a homogenous group, generally consisting of standardized products that are smaller in amount and distributed over a large number of individual borrowers. The group is segmented into 
three
 categories – residential real estate, HELOC and consumer.

Contractual terms are adjusted for estimated prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. Wesbanco models term loans with an annualized “prepayment” rate. When Wesbanco has a specific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.
The evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies pertaining to the allowance for credit losses. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the model’s quantitative results to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio.

Commercial loans, including CRE and C&I that have unique characteristics, are tested individually for estimated credit losses.  Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any. The present value of expected future cash flows are discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral discounted by the estimated selling expenses, if the loan is collateral dependent. Wesbanco chooses the appropriate measurement method on a loan by loan basis for an individually evaluated loan, except for collateral dependent loans for which foreclosure of the collateral is probable. A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. If the Bank determines that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, ASC 326-20 requires that the expected credit loss be based on the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. At this point, the loan would either be charged down or adequately reserved.
Management may also adjust its assumptions to account for differences between expected and actual losses from period to period.  The variability of management’s assumptions could alter the level of the allowance for credit losses and may have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition.  The loss estimation models and methods used to determine the allowance for credit losses are continually refined and enhanced.

80

Premises and Equipment—
 Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated economic useful lives of the leased assets or the remaining terms of the underlying leases. Useful lives range from 
3
 to 
10 years
 for furniture and equipment, 
15
 to 
39 years
 for buildings and building improvements, and 
15 years
 for land improvements. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset.

Operating leases are recorded as a right of use (“ROU”) asset and operating lease liability, included in premises and equipment, net and other liabilities, respectively. Operating lease ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is recorded primarily in net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets—
 Other real estate owned and repossessed assets, which are considered available-for-sale and are reported in other assets, are carried at the lower of cost or their estimated current fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Other real estate owned consists primarily of properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure. Repossessed collateral primarily consists of automobiles and other types of collateral acquired to satisfy defaulted consumer loans. Subsequent declines in fair value, if any, income and expense associated with the management of the collateral, and gains or losses on the disposition of these assets are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in non-interest income. Refer to Note 14, “Revenue Recognition” for further detail.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets—
 Wesbanco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.
Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of core deposit and customer list intangibles (long-term customer-relationship intangible assets) are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods over their weighted-average estimated useful lives, ranging from 
ten
 to 
sixteen years
 in total, and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Non-compete agreements are recognized in other assets on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective agreements, ranging from 
one
 to 
four years
.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test, or Wesbanco may elect to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the qualitative assessment, Wesbanco assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill. If it is more likely than not, the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired, and no impairment loss is recognized. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Wesbanco does 
no
t have any indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance—
 Wesbanco has purchased life insurance policies on certain executive and other officers. Wesbanco receives the cash surrender value of each policy upon its termination or benefits are payable upon the death of the insured. These policies are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their net cash surrender value. Changes in net cash surrender value are recognized in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Adjustments to cash surrender value and death benefits received, if recognized as income, are currently tax-exempt.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments—
 In order to attract potential home borrowers, Wesbanco offers interest rate lock commitments (“IRLC”) to such potential borrowers. IRLC are generally for 
sixty days
 and guarantee a specified interest rate for a loan if underwriting standards are met, but the commitment does not obligate the potential borrower to close on the loan. Accordingly, some IRLC expire prior to the funding of the related loan. For IRLC issued in connection with potential loans intended for sale, which consist primarily of originated longer-term fixed rate residential home mortgage loans that qualify for secondary market sale, the Bank enters into positions of forward month mortgage-backed securities to be announced (“TBA”) contracts on a mandatory basis or on a one-to-one forward sales contract on a best efforts basis.

81

A mortgage loan sold on a mandatory basis to the secondary market is considered sold when the mortgage loan is funded. Wesbanco enters into TBA contracts in order to control interest rate risk during the period between the IRLC and the sale of the mortgage loan. The IRLC is executed between the mortgagee and Wesbanco, and the forward TBA contract is executed between Wesbanco and a counterparty. Both the IRLC and the forward TBA contract are considered derivatives. A mortgage loan sold on a best efforts basis is locked into a forward sales contract on the same day as the IRLC to control interest rate risk during the period between the IRLC and the sale of the mortgage loan. The IRLC is executed between the mortgagee and Wesbanco, and the forward sales contract is executed between Wesbanco and a counterparty. Both the IRLC and the forward sales contract are considered derivatives. Both types of derivatives are recorded at fair value and are not designated in a qualified hedged accounting program. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings within mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of IRLC is the gain or loss that would be realized on the underlying loans assuming exercise of the commitments under current market rates versus the rate incorporated in the commitments, taking into consideration loans cancelled prior to closing. The fair value of forward sales contracts is based on quoted market prices. Since loans typically close before receipt of funding from an investor, they are accounted for at fair value as “Loans Held for Sale” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—
 Wesbanco records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether Wesbanco has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Wesbanco enters into back-to-back interest rate swaps and caps with commercial banking customers and then with counterparties for the offsetting interest rate swap or cap. Currently, none of Wesbanco’s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives are not used to manage risks within Wesbanco’s assets or liabilities. As such, all changes in fair value of Wesbanco’s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
Income Taxes—
 The provision for income taxes included in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes both federal and state income taxes and is based on income in the financial statements, rather than amounts reported on Wesbanco’s income tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at which rates they are expected to turnaround. A test of the anticipated realizability of deferred tax assets is performed at least annually.
Fair Value—
 Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs. The ASC also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for the same security that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable, either directly or indirectly, in the market;
Level 3—Valuation is generated from model-based techniques where one or more significant assumptions are not observable, either directly or indirectly, in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Earnings Per Common Share—
 Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For diluted EPS, the weighted-average number of shares for the period is increased by the number of shares, which would be issued assuming the exercise of in-the-money common stock options and any outstanding warrants. Time-based restricted stock shares are recorded as issued and outstanding upon their grant, rather than upon vesting, and therefore are included in the weighted-average shares outstanding due to voting rights granted at the time restricted stock is granted. Performance and market-based restricted stock shares are recorded as issued and outstanding upon their achieving the required performance or market factors. These restricted shares are included in the number of shares outstanding for diluted EPS if their performance or market factors are expected to be achieved as of the reporting date.
Trust Assets—
 Assets held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for its customers are not included as assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain money market trust assets are held on deposit at the Bank and are accounted for as such.
Stock-Based Compensation—
 Stock-based 
compensation awards granted, comprised of stock options, performance and time-based restricted stock, and total shareholder return (“TSR”) awards are valued at fair value and compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or performance period of each award. For service-based awards with graded vesting schedules, compensation expense is divided among the vesting periods with each separately vested portion of the award recognized in compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For performance-based awards and TSR awards, compensation expense is recognized evenly over the performance period, based on the probability of the achievements of the

82

performance 
or market conditions set forth in the plans. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)”, Wesbanco recognizes forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating them over the life of the award.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan—
 Wesbanco recognizes in the statement of financial position an asset for the plan’s overfunded status or a liability for the plan’s underfunded status. Wesbanco recognizes fluctuations in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. Plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing observable market prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The discount rate utilized is based on a fitted yield curve approach whereby the yield curve compares the expected stream of future benefit payments for the plan to high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace to determine an equivalent discount rate. Periodic pension expense includes service costs, interest costs based on an assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially-derived market-related value, an assumed rate of annual compensation increase, and amortization or accretion of actuarial gains and losses as well as other actuarial assumptions. The service cost component is recognized in salaries and wages and the remaining costs are recognized in employee benefits within the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Wesbanco utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The plan has been closed to new entrants since August 2007; however, benefits are still earned for those plan participants with continuing employment after August 2007. Refer to Note 13, “Employee Benefit Plans” for further detail.
Post-retirement Medical Benefit Plan—
 Wesbanco acquired a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for certain key employees from Farmers Capital Bank Corp. (“FFKT”). The Plan provides lifetime medical and dental benefits upon retirement for certain employees meeting the eligibility requirement, which were amended by Wesbanco upon acquisition. Wesbanco recognizes a liability for the projected benefit obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other liabilities as this plan is unfunded until period payments are made. Wesbanco recognizes fluctuations in the projected benefit obligation through other comprehensive income. The projected benefit obligation is based on the present value of projected medical and dental obligations at an assumed discount rate. Periodic benefit expense includes service cost, interest cost based on an assumed discount rate, and amortization or accretion of actuarial gains and losses, as well as other actuarial assumptions. Refer to Note 13, “Employee Benefit Plans” for further detail.
Business Segments—
 Operating segments are components of a business about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Wesbanco has identified Community Banking and Trust and Investment Services as its 
two
 reportable operating segments upon which the chief operating decision maker makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance.  
Corporate support functions, which are generally all attributable to the parent company, do not represent a reportable segment and are presented within Corporate Other for purposes of reconciling to the consolidated financials.  
Management continues to evaluate all business units for separate reporting as facts and circumstances change.  The accounting policies used in the disclosure of business segments are the same as those described elsewhere in the summary of significant accounting policies.  The prior periods have been recast to conform to the new current period presentation and to comply with the new disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07.  For a complete overview of Wesbanco’s business segments, see note 24, "Business Segments."
Recent accounting pronouncements—
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) as noted below.
ASU 2024-04 – Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20).” The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. Under the amendments, to account for a settlement of a convertible debt instrument as an induced conversion, an inducement offer is required to provide the debt holder with, at a minimum, the consideration (in form and amount) issuable under the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the instrument.  For Wesbanco, the amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2020-06. The amendments in this Update permit an entity to apply the new guidance on either a prospective or a retrospective basis. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2024-03 – Income Statement - Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures.” The amendments in this Update improve financial reporting by requiring that public business entities disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This information is generally not presented in the financial statements today. For Wesbanco, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated

83

Financial Statements, but is expected to result in additional disclosures and potential changes to the line items on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
ASU 2024-02 - Codification Improvements—Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, “Codification Improvements—Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements.” The removal of all references to Concepts Statements in the guidance will simplify the Codification and draw a distinction between authoritative and nonauthoritative literature. For Wesbanco, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2024-01 – Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, “Stock Compensation (Topic 718).” The amendments in this Update are designed to improve GAAP by adding an illustrative example that includes four fact patterns to demonstrate how an entity should apply the scope guidance in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to determine whether a profits interest award should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718. The illustrative example is intended to reduce (1) complexity in determining whether a profits interest award is subject to the guidance in Topic 718 and (2) existing diversity in practice. For Wesbanco, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it should adopt them as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740)." The amendments in this Update related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures and are designed to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. For Wesbanco, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, but is expected to result in additional disclosures within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-08 – Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of a Crypto Asset
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60)." The amendments in this Update require that an entity measure crypto assets at fair value in the statement of financial position each reporting period and recognize changes from remeasurement in net income. The amendments also require that an entity provide enhanced disclosures for both annual and interim reporting periods to provide investors with relevant information to analyze and assess the exposure and risk of significant individual crypto asset holdings. In addition, fair value measurement aligns the accounting required for holders of crypto assets with the accounting for entities that are subject to certain industry-specific guidance (such as investment companies) and eliminates the requirement to test those assets for impairment, thereby reducing the associated cost and complexity of applying the current guidance. For Wesbanco, the amendments are effective for both interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as Wesbanco holds no crypto assets.
ASU 2023-07—Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280).” The amendments in this Update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The amendments in this Update do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. For Wesbanco, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. For Wesbanco, the amendments were effective on 
December 31, 2024
. The 
adoption
 of this pronouncement did 
no
t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, but has resulted in additional disclosures within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to segment reporting.  Please refer to Footnote 24, "Business Segments" for additional information.

84

ASU 2023-06 - Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, "Disclosure Improvements." For entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements and for entities required to file or furnish financial statements with or to the SEC in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective.  If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-05 – Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement
In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, "Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement," under which an entity that qualifies as either a joint venture or a corporate joint venture as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") master glossary is required to apply a new basis of accounting upon the formation of the joint venture. Specifically, the ASU provides that a joint venture or a corporate joint venture (collectively, “joint ventures”) must initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on the formation date. For Wesbanco, the amendments are effective for all joint ventures within the ASU’s scope that are formed on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period as of the beginning of the related fiscal year. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-02 – Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method. ASU 2023-02 allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. The ASU’s amendments “remove the specialized guidance for [low-income-housing tax credit] investments that are not accounted for using the proportional amortization method and instead require that those LIHTC investments be accounted for using the guidance in other [GAAP].” For Wesbanco, the amendments were effective on 
January 1, 2024
. The 
adoption
 of this pronouncement did 
no
t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-01 - Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements. ASU 2023-01 amends certain provisions of ASC 842 that apply to arrangements between related parties under common control.  Additionally, ASU 2023-01 amends the accounting for leasehold improvements in common-control arrangements for all entities. For Wesbanco, the amendments were effective on 
January 1, 2024
. The 
adoption
 of this pronouncement did 
no
t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2022-04 - Liabilities – Supplier Finance Programs (Sub-topic 405-50)
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50).” The amendments in this ASU require that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that objective, the buyer should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs.  For Wesbanco, this update was effective beginning on January 1, 2023, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which was effective on 
January 1, 2024
.  As this is not part of Wesbanco's current business activities, the 
adoption
 of this full pronouncement did 
no
t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2022-03 - Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security, and therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. Furthermore, the amendments to this ASU clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The update to this ASU requires the following disclosures for equity securities: (1) the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions reflected in the balance sheet; (2) the nature and remaining duration of the restriction(s) and; (3) the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s). The amendments in this Update were effective on 
January 1, 2024
.  The 
adoption
 of this pronouncement did 
no
t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE
 2. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
On July 25, 2024, Wesbanco, Wesbanco Bank, Premier and Premier Bank jointly announced the execution of a definitive Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Premier with and into Wesbanco and the merger of Premier Bank with and into Wesbanco Bank. Premier is a bank holding company headquartered in Defiance, OH, with approximately $
8.6
 billion in assets, $
6.5
 billion in portfolio loans, $
6.8
 billion in deposits, $
1.0
 billion in stockholders’ equity and 
73
 branches as of December 31, 2024.  The merger was completed on 
February 28, 2025
. Under the terms of the Agreement, Wesbanco exchanged its common stock for Premier common stock in an all stock transaction.  Except as provided in the Merger Agreement,  Premier options were cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash in respect of each Net Option Share, as defined in the Merger Agreement. Premier shareholders received 
0.80
 shares of Wesbanco common stock per each share of Premier common stock. The receipt by Premier shareholders of shares of Wesbanco common stock in exchange for their shares of Premier common stock is anticipated to qualify as a tax-free exchange.
In connection with the merger, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 which included a joint proxy statement of Premier Financial and the Company and a prospectus of the Company with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued in the transaction, as well as other relevant documents concerning the transaction.  The Form S-4 was declared effective on October 28, 2024, and Wesbanco and Premier Financial commenced mailing to their respective shareholders on or about November 1, 2024 in connection with their respective special meetings of shareholders, which were held on December 11, 2024, at which the shareholders of both companies approved all matters related to the transaction that were submitted for a vote.  In addition, all of the required regulatory approvals were received on February 12, 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Wesbanco recorded merger-related expenses of $
2.9
 million related to the Premier acquisition.

As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 shares were estimated to be awarded under the total shareholder plans, as the performance metrics were not met and therefore were not included in the diluted calculation. As of December 31, 2023 and 
2022
, 
24,000
 and 
53,280
 shares, respectively, were estimated to be awarded under the active total shareholder return plans as stock performance targets had been met and were included in the diluted calculation.

In addition, performance-based restricted stock compensation totaling

68,833
 and 
53,230
 shares were estimated to be awarded as of December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were included in the calculation.
As previously disclosed in Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 26, 2024, in conjunction with the announcement of the agreement and Plan of Merger with Premier, on August 1, 2024, Wesbanco issued 
7,272,728
 shares of common stock to complete a $
200
 million common equity capital raise.  This equity issuance was primarily to support the pro-forma bank's balance sheet and regulatory capital ratios.  These shares are included in average shares outstanding beginning on that date.  For additional information relating to the Premier acquisition, refer to Note 2, "Mergers and Acquisitions."

The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities by contractual maturity at

Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are classified in the table below based on their contractual maturity date; however, regular principal payments and prepayments of principal are received on a monthly basis.

The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco’s held-to-maturity debt portfolio are analyzed quarterly to determine if an allowance for current expected credit losses is warranted. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate expected credit losses on an individual security basis. The expected credit losses are adjusted quarterly and are recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra asset. The losses are recorded on the income statement in the provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities, which was $
8.4
 million and $
8.8
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Held-to-maturity investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies as well as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, have no historical evidence supporting expected credit losses; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at 
zero
, and will monitor this assumption in the future for any economical or governmental policies that could affect this assumption.

Unrealized losses on debt securities in the tables above represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to fixed yields. Unrealized losses in the available-for-sale portfolio are accounted for as an adjustment, net of taxes, to other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.  Wesbanco does not believe the securities presented above are impaired due to reasons of credit quality, as substantially all debt securities are rated above investment grade and all are paying principal and interest according to their contractual terms. Wesbanco does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell, loss position securities prior to recovery of their cost, and therefore, management believes the unrealized losses detailed above do not require an allowance for credit losses relating to these securities to be recognized.
Securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and for which Wesbanco does not exercise significant influence are carried at cost. Cost method investments consist primarily of FHLB stock totaling $
48.2
 million and $
62.0
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying value may not be recoverable.

TE 5. LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

 million at 
December 31, 2024
 and $
11.5
 million at 
December 31, 2023
.  The un-accreted discount on purchased loans from acquisitions was $

 million at 
December 31, 2024
 and $

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses under CECL is calculated utilizing the probability of default ("PD")/ loss given default ("LGD"), which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, portfolio mix and loan growth. At December 31, 2024
, the primary drivers of the allowance were loan growth, macroeconomic variables and prepayment speeds, as well as changes in qualitative factors for distressed industries, the current interest rate environment and changes in the level of criticized and classified loans within the commercial loan categories.  The forecast was based upon a probability weighted approach which is designed to incorporate loss projections from a baseline, upside and downside economy. Due to the nonlinearity of credit losses to the economy, the asymmetry is best captured by evaluating multiple economic scenarios through a probability weighted approach. At year-end, Wesbanco applied a one-year forecast and immediately reverted to historical losses. The national unemployment rate was projected to be 
4.6
% as of 
December 31, 2024
 and subsequently increase to an average of 
4.9
% over the remainder of the one-year forecast period. Accrued interest receivable for loans was $
62.2
 million at both 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses because the Company has a policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when loans are placed on non-accrual.  However, Wesbanco does have a $
0.1
 million reserve on the accrued interest related to loan modifications allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act due to the timing and nature of these modifications.  Accrued interest related to COVID-19 loan modifications as permitted under the CARES Act was $
13.9
 million and $
15.6
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Commercial Loan Risk Grades
Commercial loan risk grades are determined based on an evaluation of the relevant characteristics of each loan, assigned at inception and adjusted thereafter at any time to reflect changes in the risk profile throughout the life of each loan.  The primary factors used to determine the risk grade are the sufficiency, reliability and sustainability of the primary source of repayment and overall financial strength of the borrower.  The rating system more heavily weights the debt service coverage, leverage and loan to value factors to derive the risk grade.  Other factors that are considered at a lesser weighting include management, industry or property type risks, payment history, collateral or guarantees.
Commercial real estate – land and construction consists of loans to finance investments in vacant land, land development, construction of residential housing, and construction of commercial buildings.  Commercial real estate – improved property consists of loans for the purchase or refinance of all types of improved owner-occupied and investment properties.  Factors that are considered in assigning the risk grade vary depending on the type of property financed.  The risk grade assigned to construction and development loans is based on the overall viability of the project, the experience and financial capacity of the developer or builder to successfully complete the project, project specific and market absorption rates and comparable property values, and the amount of pre-sales for residential housing construction or pre-leases for commercial investment property.  The risk grade assigned to commercial investment property loans is based primarily on the adequacy of the net operating income generated by the property to service the debt (“debt service coverage”), the loan to appraised value, the type, quality, industry and mix of tenants, and the terms of leases.  The risk grade assigned to owner-occupied commercial real estate is based primarily on global debt service coverage and the leverage of the business, but may also consider the industry in which the business operates, the business’ specific competitive advantages or disadvantages, collateral margins and the quality and experience of management.
C&I loans consist of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable, inventory and other general business purposes; term loans to finance fixed assets other than real estate, and letters of credit to support trade, insurance or governmental requirements for a variety of businesses.  Most C&I borrowers are privately-held companies with annual sales up to $
100
 million. 
Primary factors that are

95

considered 
in risk rating C&I loans include debt service coverage and leverage.  Other factors including operating trends, collateral coverage along with management experience are also considered.
Pass loans are those that exhibit a history of positive financial results that are at least comparable to the average for their industry or type of real estate.  The primary source of repayment is acceptable and these loans are expected to perform satisfactorily during most economic cycles.  Pass loans typically have no significant external factors that are expected to adversely affect these borrowers more than others in the same industry or property type.  Any minor unfavorable characteristics of these loans are outweighed or mitigated by other positive factors including but not limited to adequate secondary or tertiary sources of repayment.
Criticized loans, considered as compromised, have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the bank's credit position at some future date. Criticized loans are not adversely classified by the banking regulators and do not expose the bank to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
Classified loans, considered as substandard and doubtful, are equivalent to the classifications used by banking regulators.  Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  These loans may or may not be reported as non-accrual.  Doubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These loans are reported as non-accrual.

Residential real estate, home equity and consumer loans are not assigned internal risk grades other than as required by regulatory guidelines that are based primarily on the age of past due loans. Wesbanco primarily evaluates the credit quality of residential real estate, home equity and consumer loans based on repayment performance and historical loss rates. The aggregate amount of residential real estate, home equity and consumer loans classified as substandard in accordance with regulatory guidelines were $
23.3
 million at 
December 31, 2024
 and $
20.0
 million at 
December 31, 2023
, of which $
4.5
 million and $
4.6
 million were accruing, for each period, respectively. These loans are not included in the tables above. In addition, $
36.1
 million and $
21.2
 million of unfunded criticized and classified commercial loan commitments are not included in the tables above for 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The following table summarizes loans with MBEFDs which defaulted (defined as 90 days past due) during the 12 months after the loan was modified. Modified loans, including those that have defaulted, are already included in the allowance for credit losses through the various methodologies used to estimate the allowance. As such, 
no
 modification to the allowance is recorded specifically due to a modified loan subsequently defaulting.

Depreciation and amortization expense of premises and equipment charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was $
15.3
 million, $
14.4
 million and $
13.0
 million, respectively.
Operating leases are recorded as a right of use (“ROU”) asset and operating lease liability, included in premises and equipment, net and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is recorded primarily in net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Operating leases relate primarily to bank branches, office space and license agreements with remaining lease terms of generally 
1
 to 
30 years
, which include options for multiple 
five
 and 
ten year
 extensions, with a weighted average lease term of 
14
 years. As of 
December 31, 2024
, operating lease 
ROU assets
 and 
liabilities 
were $
34.8
 million and $
39.0
 million, respectively, and as of 
December 31, 2023
, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were $
42.1
 million and $
46.3
 million, respectively. The lease expense for operating leases was $
5.0
 million, $
4.6
 million and $
4.6
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively. The weighted average discount rate was 
3.10
% as of 
December 31, 2024
.  Wesbanco also has certain software licenses and maintenance agreements that are not subject to ASC 842, "Leases."  Of those, the Bank has a contract with its core banking software provider through 2027, in which it is projected the annual obligation during the contract period will be a minimum of $
11.2
 million per year.

Finance leases relate primarily to bank branches, equipment and office space with remaining lease terms of generally 
5
 to 
25 years
, which include options for multiple 
five
 and 
ten year
 extensions, with weighted-average lease terms of 1
0
 years. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the finance lease 
ROU assets
 and 
liabilities
 were $
26.1
 million and $
27.0
 million, respectively, and were $
29.1
 million and $

27.3
 million and $
35.5
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, primarily consist of core deposit and other customer list intangibles, which have finite lives and are amortized using straight line and accelerated methods. Other intangible assets are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from 
ten
 to 
sixteen years
. Amortization of core deposit and customer list intangible assets totaled $
8.3
 million, $
9.1
 million and $
10.3
 million for the years ended

OTE 8. INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
Wesbanco is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest in approved low-income housing investment tax credit projects. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The limited partnerships are considered to be VIEs as they generally do not have equity investors with voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources to support their activities. The VIEs have not been consolidated because Wesbanco is not considered the primary beneficiary. All of Wesbanco’s investments

in limited partnerships are privately held, and their market values are not readily available. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had $
38.2
 million and $
31.9
 million, respectively, invested in these partnerships. Wesbanco also recognizes the unconditional unfunded equity commitments of $
19.0
 million and $
13.9
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in other liabilities. 

Wesbanco classifies the amortization of the investment as a component of income tax expense (benefit) and proportionally amortizes the investment over the tax credit period. The 
amortization
 for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was $
4.7
 million, $
4.2
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively. Tax benefits attributed to these partnerships include low-income housing and historic tax credits which totaled $
4.3
 million, $
3.8
 million and $
3.5
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are also included in income tax expense.
Wesbanco is also a limited partner in 
two
 other limited partnerships as of 
December 31, 2024.  These provide seed money and capital to startup companies, and financing to low-income housing projects. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had $
2.9
 million and $
3.0
 million, respectively, invested in these partnerships, which are recorded in other assets using the equity method. Wesbanco included in operations under the equity method of accounting its share of the partnerships’ net income (loss) of $
35
 thousand and ($
0.9
) million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022
, respectively.  Partnership net income (loss) was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Gains (losses) totaling $
0.1
 million and ($
1.0
) million relating to the sale and the change in the fair value of the underlying investments funded by Wesbanco's Community Development Corporation was included within the partnerships' net income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  This income is located within net gain (loss) on other real estate owned and other assets on the consolidated statements of income and predominantly relates to the Tech Growth investment, which was sold in 2022 and 2023.

TE 10. FHLB AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
Wesbanco is a member of the FHLB system. Wesbanco’s FHLB borrowings, which consist of borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh are secured by a blanket lien by the FHLB on certain residential mortgages and other loan types or securities with a market value in excess of the outstanding balances of the borrowings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had FHLB borrowings of $
1.0
 billion and $
1.4
 billion, respectively, with a remaining weighted-average interest rate of 
4.66
% and 
5.40
%, respectively. The terms of the security agreement with the FHLB include a specific assignment of collateral that requires the maintenance of qualifying mortgage and other types of loans as pledged collateral with unpaid principal amounts in excess of the FHLB advances, when discounted at certain pre-established percentages of the loans’ unpaid principal balances. FHLB stock owned by Wesbanco totaling $
48.2
 million and $
62.0
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is also pledged as collateral on these advances. The remaining maximum borrowing capacity by Wesbanco with the FHLB at December 31, 2024 and 2023
 was estimated to be approximately $
3.7
 billion and $
3.4
 billion, respectively.

TE 11. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT
Wesbanco issued $
150.0
 million of subordinated debentures on March 23, 2022.  The subordinated debentures have a fixed rate of 
3.75
% for the first five years and a floating rate for the next five years at 
Three Month Term 
Secured Overnight Financing Rate
 ("SOFR")
 plus a spread of 
1.787
%.  The subordinated debentures are callable after five years, mature on 
April 1, 2032
 and count towards Tier 2 Capital.
Certain trusts, consisting of Wesbanco Capital Trust II, Wesbanco Capital Statutory Trust III, Wesbanco Capital Trusts IV, V and VI, Oak Hill Capital Trusts 2, 3 and 4, Community Bank Shares Statutory Trusts I and II and First Federal Statutory Trust II are all wholly-owned trust subsidiaries of Wesbanco formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”) into a pool of other financial services entity trust preferred securities, and lending the proceeds to Wesbanco. The Trust Preferred Securities were issued and sold in private placement offerings. The proceeds from the sale of the securities and the issuance of common stock by the Trusts were invested in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debt”) issued by Wesbanco and former acquired banks, which are the sole assets of the Trusts. The Trusts pay dividends on the Trust Preferred Securities at the same rate as the distributions paid by Wesbanco on the Junior Subordinated Debt held by the Trusts. The Trusts provide Wesbanco with the option to defer payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt for an aggregate of 
20 consecutive quarterly periods
. Should any of these options be utilized, Wesbanco may not declare or pay dividends on its common stock during any such period. Undertakings made by Wesbanco with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities for the Trusts constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Wesbanco of the obligations of these Trust Preferred Securities.

The Junior Subordinated Debt is presented as a separate category of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For regulatory purposes, at December 31, 2024, all such securities are counted as Tier 2 capital subject to limits. The Trust Preferred Securities provide the issuer with a unique capital instrument that has a tax-deductible interest feature not normally associated with the equity of a corporation.

TE 12. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
Wesbanco is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. Wesbanco principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. Wesbanco manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its assets and liabilities. Wesbanco’s existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in Wesbanco’s assets or liabilities. Wesbanco manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. A matched book is when the Bank’s assets and liabilities are equally distributed but also have similar maturities.
Loan Swaps
Wesbanco executes interest rate swaps and interest rate caps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps and caps are simultaneously economically hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps and caps that Wesbanco executes with a third party, such that Wesbanco minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Because the interest rate swaps and caps associated with this program do not meet the hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and caps and the offsetting third-party swaps and caps are recognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had 
293
 and 
236
, respectively, interest rate swaps and caps with an aggregate notional amount of $
1.9
 billion and $
1.6
 billion, respectively, related to this program.  Wesbanco recognized $
4.9
 million, $
9.0
 million and $
4.4
 million of income for the related swap and cap fees for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Risk participation agreements are entered into as financial guarantees of performance on interest rate swap derivatives. The purchased asset or sold liability allows Wesbanco to participate-in (fee received) or participate-out (fee paid) the risk associated with certain derivative positions executed by the borrower of the lead bank in a loan syndication. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had 
24
 and 
19
, respectively, risk participation-in agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $
233.8
 million and $
197.2
 million, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Wesbanco had 
eight
 and 
five
, respectively, risk participation-out agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $
67.7
 million and $
40.9
 million, respectively.
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Interest Rate Lock Commitments
Certain residential mortgage loans are originated for sale in the secondary mortgage loan market. These loans are classified as held for sale and carried at fair value as Wesbanco has elected the fair value option. Fair value is determined based on rates obtained from the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. Wesbanco sells loans to the secondary market on either a mandatory or best efforts basis. The loans sold on a mandatory basis are not committed to an investor until the loan is closed with the borrower. Wesbanco enters into forward to be announced (“TBA”) contracts to manage the interest rate risk between the lock commitment and the closing of the loan.  The total balance of forward TBA contracts entered into was $
29.0
 million and $
27.0
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  The loans sold on a best efforts basis are committed to an investor simultaneous to the interest rate commitment with the borrower, and as a result, the Company does not enter into a separate forward TBA contract to offset the fair value risk, as the investor accepts such risk in exchange for a lower premium on sale.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet
All derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivative assets are classified in the consolidated balance sheet under other assets, and derivative liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheet under other liabilities. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. None of Wesbanco’s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships under ASC 815.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features
Wesbanco has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if Wesbanco defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Wesbanco could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
Wesbanco also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if Wesbanco fails to maintain its status as either a “well-" or “adequately-capitalized” institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and Wesbanco would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
Dependent upon the net present value of the underlying swaps, Wesbanco has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties.  If Wesbanco had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2024

In certain market situations, Wesbanco can also request collateral from the derivative counterparties.  Due to the current higher interest rate environment, Wesbanco is holding net cash collateral from various derivative counterparties totaling $

E 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Benefit Pension Plan—
 The Wesbanco, Inc. Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“the Plan”) established on January 1, 1985, is a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan. The Plan covers all employees of Wesbanco and its subsidiaries who were hired on or before August 1, 2007 who satisfy minimum age and length of service requirements. Benefits of the Plan are generally based on years of service and the employee’s compensation during the last 
five years
 of employment. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. Wesbanco uses a December 31 measurement date for the Plan.
On December 12, 2024, Wesbanco signed an agreement with a third-party annuity provider to transfer the future payment obligations of 
685
 participant annuitants. The liability associated with these annuitants was $
70.3
 million. Since the liability exceeded the sum of the 2024 service cost and interest cost, a settlement under ASC 715 was recognized and measured as of December 31, 2024. The total liability settled during 2024 including all lump sums paid and the annuity purchase totaled $
72.5
 million and $
70.3
 million, respectively, which represented 
56.9
% of the Projected Benefit Obligation and as a result, 
56.9
% of the unrecognized gain position of $
4.0
 million was recognized. The recognition resulted in a settlement gain of $
2.3
 million.

As permitted under ASC 715-30-35-13, the amortization of any prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the Plan.

The expected long-term rate of return for the Plan’s total assets is based on the expected return of each of the Plan asset categories, weighted based on the median of the target allocation for each class.
Pension Plan Investment Policy and Strategy—
 The investment policy as established by the Pension and Post-Retirement Plan Committee, to be followed by the Trustee, which is Wesbanco’s Trust and Investment Services department, is to invest assets based on the target allocations shown in the table below. Assets are reallocated periodically by the Trustee based on the ranges set forth by the Committee to meet the target allocations. The investment policy is also subject to review periodically to determine if the policy should be changed. Plan assets are to be invested with the principal objective of maximizing long-term total return without exposing Plan assets to undue risk, taking into account the Plan’s funding needs and benefit obligations. Assets are to be invested in a balanced portfolio composed primarily of equities, fixed income, alternative asset funds and cash or cash equivalent money market investments.
In 2021, the Committee adopted certain changes to the investment policy for the Defined Benefit Pension Plan that recognizes over time the return requirements and risk tolerance of the plan will change.  Based on an assessment of the long-term goals and desired risk levels, the Committee approved the development of a glide path that adjusts the target allocations as the Plan’s funded status changes.  Given the United States pension regulations and demographics of the Plan, a more risk averse investment approach is deemed appropriate to reduce the funded status volatility.  Thus, modifications were made to the return seeking portfolio and the liability hedging portfolio as detailed in the plan.  The revised Plan notes that return seeking assets generally consist of investments that focus on price appreciation with returns that, over the long term, are above the interest costs of the Plan.  Thus, the policy set target allocations to return seeking assets and rebalanced the ranges for the same.  Additionally, the investment policy statement was changed to note that liability hedging assets will be investment grade fixed income investments and are expected to generally behave like the Plan’s liabilities.  Since these assets focus mainly on current income, their expected long-term returns will generally be lower than return seeking assets.  The policy provides that based on the hedge path, the mix of short term, intermediate term, and long term fixed income holdings will vary.  As a result, there will not be set target allocations and ranges for each maturity category, but rather to the hedge path target.  Changes to the Plan’s holdings, as noted in the chart below, reflect the changes implemented pursuant to the change in the investment policy statement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Plan’s equity securities included 
55,300

shares of Wesbanco common stock with a fair market value of $
1.8
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively.

FFKT Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan—
 Wesbanco assumed FFKT’s postretirement medical benefit plan upon acquisition, which had a liability totaling $
15.0
 million at the acquisition date. The plan covers FFKT employees who were hired before January 1, 2016 and meet certain age and length of full-time service requirements. The plan was modified in August 2018, which reduced the number of eligible employees. The modification resulted in a $
5.5
 million unrealized gain, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and will be recognized over the life of the plan participants estimated to be approximately 
17
 years. Benefits provided under this plan are unfunded, and payments to the plan participants are made by Wesbanco.

401(k) Plan —
 Wesbanco sponsors a 401(k) plan consisting of a contributory 401(k) profit sharing plan covering substantially all of its employees. Under the provisions of the 401(k) plan, Wesbanco matches a portion of eligible employee contributions based on rates established and approved by the Board of Directors. For each of the past three years, Wesbanco matched 
100
% of the first 
3
% and 
50
% of the next 
2
% of eligible employee contributions.  Total expense for the 401(k) was $
5.6
 million, $
5.9
 million and $
5.5
 million in 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024
, the 401(k) held 
434,334
 shares of Wesbanco common stock of which all shares were allocated to specific employee accounts.  These shares relate in large part to the plan's prior inclusion of an employee stock ownership plan component.  Dividends on shares are either distributed to employee accounts or paid in cash to the participant. On June 28, 2024, Wesbanco registered an additional 
1,000,000
 shares of Wesbanco common stock for issuance under the 401(k) plan. Wesbanco had 
1,016,640
 an
d 
65,270
 shares registered on Form S-8 remaining for future issuance under the 401(k) plan at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Incentive Bonus, Option and Restricted Stock Plan—
 The Incentive Bonus, Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), is a non-qualified plan that includes the following components: an Annual Bonus and a Long-Term Incentive, which included a Total Shareholder Return Plan, a Stock Option component, and a Restricted Stock component for certain key officers of the Company. The components allow for payments of cash, a mixture of cash and stock, granting of stock options, or granting of restricted stock, depending upon the component of the Incentive Plan in which the award is earned, through the attainment of certain performance goals or time-based vesting requirements. Performance goals or service vesting requirements are established by Wesbanco’s Compensation Committee. On April 19, 2024, Wesbanco registered an additional 
1,100,000
 shares of Wesbanco common stock for issuance under the Incentive Plan. Wesbanco had 
1,793,381

an
d 
1,069,689
 shares registered on Form S-8 remaining for future issuance under equity compensation plans at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Effective December 1, 2023, Wesbanco adopted a new incentive-based compensation recovery policy ("clawback policy") in reference to the requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5608 of the corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and revoked the prior clawback policy that was in effect.  Please refer to Exhibit 97 of this form 10-K for the full version of the clawback policy.

115

Annual Bonus
Compensation expense for key officers for the Annual Bonus was
 $
4.4

million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Stock Options
On May 15, 2024, Wesbanco granted 
156,000
 stock options to selected participants, including certain named executive officers at an exercise price of $
28.60
 per share. The options granted in 2024 are service-based and vest in two equal installments on May 15, 2025 and December 31, 2025, and expire 
seven years
 from the date of grant.
Compensation expense for the stock option component of the Incentive Plan was
 $
1.0
 m
illion, $
0.9
 million and $
1.1
 million for 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants totaled
 $
0.5
 million, wi
th an expense recognition period of 
one year
 remaining. The maximum term of options granted under Wesbanco’s stock option plan is 
ten years
 from the original grant date; however, options granted in 2024 had a term of 
seven years
.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $
0.5
 million and 
$
0.1
 m
illion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. The cash received and related tax benefit realized from stock options exercised was $
1.5
 million an
d $
0.1
 million
 in 2024
 and was $
0.2
 million and $
20
 thousand in 
2023. Shares issued in connection with options exercised are issued from treasury shares acquired under Wesbanco’s share repurchase plans or from issuance of authorized but unissued shares, subject to prior SEC registration.
The fair value of stock options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that might otherwise have a significant effect on the value of stock options granted that are not considered by the model.
The following table sets forth the significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the grants:

The weighted-average life assumption is an estimate of the length of time that an employee might hold an option before option exercise, option expiration or employment termination. The weighted-average life assumption was developed using historical experience. Wesbanco used a weighted historical volatility of its common stock price over the weighted average life prior to each issuance as the volatility factor assumption, adjusted for abnormal volatility during certain periods, and current and future dividend payment expectations for the dividend assumption.

Restricted Stock
During 2024
, Wesbanco granted 
207,970
 shares of time-based restricted stock to certain officers and directors, which cliff vest 
36
 months from the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of the restricted stock granted was $
28.43
 per share. The restricted stock grant provides the recipient with voting rights from the date of issuance. Dividends paid on these restricted shares during the restriction period are converted into additional shares of restricted stock on the date the cash dividend would have otherwise been paid, but do not vest until the related grant of the restricted shares complete their vesting. The Compensation Committee has discretion to elect to pay such dividends in cash to participants. Voting rights accrue from date of issuance of these shares.

Wesbanco also granted 
30,275
 shares of performance-based restricted stock ("PBRS") to select officers. These shares have a 
three-year
 performance period, beginning January 1, 2025, based on Wesbanco’s return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity measured for each year, compared to a national peer group of financial institutions with total assets between approximately $
13.5
 billion and $
32.2
 billion. Earned performance-based restricted shares are subject to additional service-based vesting with 
50
% vesting in May 2028 after the completion of the three-year performance period and the final 
50
% vesting in May 2029.

From the 2019 PBRS, 
4,951
 shares vested in May 2024.  The third-year reporting period in the 2020 PBRS failed to meet the performance goals measured as of December 31, 2023, so those shares were forfeited.  For the 2021 and 2022 PBRS, the second- and first-year reporting periods, respectively, achieved approximately 
86
% of the performance goal measured at December 31, 2023.  The Compensation Committee approved these goal achievements in May of 2024.  Since metrics were previously met on the first and second year reporting period for the 2020 PBRS, Wesbanco issued 
18,684
 time-based restricted shares to the select officers of the 2020 grant, which vest in equal installments of which 
9,342
 shares vested in May 2024 and the remaining shares will vest in May 2025.  
On February 25, 2021, the Incentive Plan was amended to adjust the performance goal to 
75
% and approve a pro-rata award based on the achievement between 
75
% through 
99
%, as the award will be prorated to the percentage achieved.

Dividends accrue on the restricted shares once the performance objective is achieved and then are converted into additional shares of restricted stock on the date the cash dividend would have otherwise been paid, but do not vest until the related grant of the restricted shares complete their vesting.  Voting rights accrue upon achievement of the performance objective.
Compensation expense relating to all restricted stock was $
6.1
 million, $
5.9
 million and $
5.0
 million in 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024
, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock grants totaled $
9.6
 million, with a weighted average expense recognition period of 
1.2
 years remaining.

Total Shareholder Return Plan
On November 18, 2015, Wesbanco’s Compensation Committee adopted Administrative Rules for a Total Shareholder Return Plan (“TSRP”). The TSRP measures the TSR on Wesbanco common stock over a 
three-year
 measurement period relative to the return of an established peer group of publicly traded companies over the same performance period. The award is determined at the end of the 
three-year
 period if the TSR of Wesbanco common stock is equal to or greater than the 50th percentile of the TSR of the peer group. The number of shares to be earned by the participant shall be 
200
% of the grant-date award if the TSR of Wesbanco common stock is equal to or greater than the 75th percentile of the TSR of the peer group. Upon achieving the market-based metric, shares determined to be earned by the participant become service-based and vest in three equal annual installments. Voting rights accrue at such time as well. Wesbanco granted 
12,000
 TSRP shares in 2024 for the performance period beginning January 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2026 to certain executive officers. The fair value of the market-based awards is based on a Monte-Carlo Simulation valuation of our common stock and our peers’ common stock as of the grant date.
Based on the calculation of shareholder return over the measurement period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2024
, Wesbanco stock performance did not equal or exceed the 50th percentile when compared to peer calculations of shareholder return. Therefore, none of the 
12,000
 shares relating to the 2022 TSR grant will be issued as service-based shares.
Compensation expense relating to the TSR plans was $
0.4
 million, $
0.3
 million and $
0.2
 million in 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The grant date fair value of the 2024
 TSR award was $
27.70
 per share. At 
December 31, 2024
, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested TSR awards totaled $
0.5
 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 
1.6
 years remaining.

As a result of the acquisition of Your Community Bankshares ("YCB") in 2016 and Old Line Bankshares in 2019, Wesbanco has federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $
15.5
 million, which expire beginning in 
2034
 and 
2037
, respectively. Wesbanco has Maryland NOL carryforwards of $
3.5
 million, which begin expiring in 
2030
.  Wesbanco has Kentucky NOL carryforwards of $
6.7
 million, which begin expiring in 
2034
.  The use of the federal NOL and other carryforwards are limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but they are currently expected to be utilized before their respective expiration dates.
As a result of the previous acquisitions of YCB, ESB Financial Corporation, Fidelity Bancorp, Inc., Western Ohio Financial Corporation, Winton Financial Corporation and Oak Hill Financial, Inc., retained earnings at both December 31, 2024 and 2023
 included $
45.9
 million of qualifying and non-qualifying tax bad debt reserves existing as of December 31, 1987, upon which 
no
 provision for income taxes has been recorded. The related amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is $
10.3
 million and $
10.5
 million for 
2024 and 2023, respectively. If this portion of retained earnings is used in the future for any purpose other than to absorb bad debts, it would be added to future taxable income.
Federal and state income taxes applicable to securities transactions totaled $
0.3
 million, $
0.2
 million and ($
0.4
) million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Wesbanco had $
0.1
 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest as of both 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
ne of these tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. At 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was immaterial. Wesbanco provides for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes.
Wesbanco is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to tax in various state income tax jurisdictions. Wesbanco and its prior acquired companies are no longer subject to any income tax examinations for years prior to 
2021
.

TE 17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
Fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices, if available, quoted market prices of similar assets or liabilities, or the present value of expected future cash flows and other valuation techniques. These valuations are significantly affected by discount rates, cash flow assumptions, and risk assumptions used. Therefore, fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not intended to reflect the proceeds that may be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instruments.
Fair value is determined at one point in time and is not representative of future value.  These amounts do not reflect the total value of a going concern organization. Management does not have the intention to dispose of a significant portion of its assets and liabilities, and therefore the unrealized gains or losses should not be interpreted as a forecast of future earnings and cash flows.
The following is a discussion of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and valuation techniques applied:
Investment securities:
  The fair value of investment securities which are measured on a recurring basis are determined primarily by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other similar securities. These securities are classified within level 1 or 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Positions that are not traded in active markets for which valuations are generated using assumptions not observable in the market or management’s best estimate are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  This includes certain specific municipal debt issues for which the credit quality and discount rate must be estimated.

Loans held for sale:
  Loans held for sale are carried, in aggregate, at fair value as Wesbanco previously elected the fair value option.  The use of a valuation model using quoted prices of similar instruments are significant inputs in arriving at the fair value and therefore loans held for sale are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives:
  Wesbanco enters into interest rate swap agreements with qualifying commercial customers to meet their financing, interest rate and other risk management needs.  These agreements provide the customer the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates.  The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies and monitoring.  Those interest rate swaps are economically hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that Wesbanco executes with derivative counterparties in order to offset its exposure on the fixed components of the customer interest rate swap agreements.  The interest rate swap agreement with the loan customer and with the counterparty is reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings within net swap fee and valuation income.
Wesbanco enters into forward TBA contracts to manage the interest rate risk between the loan commitments to the customer and the closing of the loan for loans that will be sold on a mandatory basis to secondary market investors.  The forward TBA contract is reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings within mortgage banking income.
Wesbanco determines the fair value for derivatives using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  Wesbanco incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty’s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements, and therefore both the derivative asset and derivative liability are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We may be required from time to time to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets and liabilities.

Collateral dependent loans:

Collateral dependent loans are carried at the amortized cost basis less the specific allowance calculated under the Current Expected Credit Losses Accounting Standard. Collateral dependent loans are calculated using a cost basis approach or collateral value approach, and therefore are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

122

Other real estate owned and repossessed assets:
  Other real estate owned and repossessed assets are carried at the lower of the investment in the assets or the fair value of the assets less estimated selling costs.  The use of independent appraisals and management’s best judgment are significant inputs in arriving at the fair value measure of the underlying collateral, and therefore other real estate owned and repossessed assets are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value amounts presented in the table below are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statements of financial position. 
The following tables set forth Wesbanco’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The following methods and assumptions were used to measure the fair value of financial instruments recorded at cost on Wesbanco’s consolidated balance sheets:
Cash and due from banks:

The carrying amount for cash and due from banks is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Held-to-maturity debt securities:

Fair values for debt securities held-to-maturity are determined in the same manner as investment securities, which are described above.  The carrying value is net of the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities.

125

Net loans:
  Fair values for loans are estimated in a valuation model using a discounted cash flow methodology.  The discount rates take into account interest rates currently being offered to customers for loans with similar terms, the credit risk associated with the loan and other market factors, including liquidity.  Wesbanco believes the discount rates are consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplace for both performing and distressed loan types. The carrying value is net of the allowance for credit losses and other associated premiums and discounts.  Due to the significant judgment involved in evaluating credit quality, loans are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Accrued interest receivable:

The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value
.
Deposits:

The carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value for all non-maturity deposit accounts, which includes non-interest bearing demand, interest bearing demand, money market and savings deposit accounts.  Non-maturity deposit accounts are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by a discounted cash flow method using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities, and is therefore classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings:

The fair value of FHLB borrowings is based on rates currently available to Wesbanco for borrowings with similar terms and remaining maturities.
Other borrowings:

The carrying amount of federal funds purchased and overnight sweep accounts generally approximate fair value.  Other repurchase agreements are based on quoted market prices if available.  If market prices are not available, for certain fixed and adjustable rate repurchase agreements, then quoted market prices of similar instruments are used.
Subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt:

The fair value of subordinated debt is determined primarily by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges, if available, or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other similar securities. These securities are classified within level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Due to the pooled nature of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts, which are not actively traded, estimated fair value is determined by using comparable corporate bond indices from the financial services sector and factoring in the applicable credit spreads and optional early redemption provisions.  These securities are classified within level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Accrued interest payable:

The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.
Off-balance sheet financial instruments:

Off-balance sheet financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit, including letters of credit. Fair values for commitments to extend credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties. The estimated fair value of the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are insignificant and therefore are not presented in the above tables.

TE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Commitments—
 In the normal course of business, Wesbanco offers off-balance sheet credit arrangements to enable its customers to meet their financing objectives. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements. Wesbanco’s exposure to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the other parties to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is limited to the contractual amount of those instruments. Wesbanco uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The allowance for credit losses associated with commitments was

$
6.1
 million and $
8.6
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including normal business activities, bond financing and similar transactions. Letters of credit are considered guarantees. The liability associated with letters of credit was $
0.2
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Contingent obligations to purchase loans funded by other entities include affordable housing plan guarantees, credit card guarantees, loans sold with recourse as well as obligations to the FHLB. Affordable housing plan guarantees are performance guarantees for various building project loans. The guarantee amortizes as the loan balances decrease. Credit card guarantees are credit card balances not owned by Wesbanco, whereby the Bank guarantees the performance of the cardholder.
The following table presents total commitments to extend credit, guarantees and various letters of credit outstanding:

TE 20. WESBANCO BANK COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Wesbanco Bank Community Development Corporation (“WBCDC”), a consolidated subsidiary of Wesbanco Bank, is a Certified Development Entity (“CDE”) with $
125.0
 million of New Markets Tax Credits (“NMTC”) all of which had been invested in WBCDC at 
December 31, 2024
. The NMTC program is administered by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the U.S. Treasury and is aimed at stimulating economic and community development and job creation in low-income communities. The program provides federal tax credits to investors who make qualified equity investments (“QEIs”) in a CDE. The CDE is required to invest the proceeds of each QEI in low-income communities, which are generally defined as those census tracts with poverty rates greater than 
20
% and/or median family incomes that are less than or equal to 
80
% of the area median family income.
The credit provided to the investor totals 
39
% of each QEI in a CDE and is claimed over a 
seven-year
 credit allowance period. In each of the first three years, the investor receives a credit equal to 
5
% of the total amount the investor paid to the CDE for each QEI. For each of the remaining four years, the investor receives a credit equal to 
6
% of the total amount the investor paid to the CDE for each QEI. As of 
December 31, 2024
, Wesbanco has received $
40.2
 million in tax credits over the seven-year credit allowance periods for its $
125.0
 million NMTC authority invested in WBCDC. Wesbanco is eligible to receive an additional $
8.6
 million in tax credits with respect to aggregate QEI amounts invested over their remaining credit allowance period.

Wesbanco Bank recognized $
3.8
 million, $
3.7
 million and $
3.5
 million in NMTC in its income tax provision for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These tax credits are subject to certain general business tax credit limitations and are therefore limited in deductibility on Wesbanco’s federal income tax return. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 prior NMTC has been carried forward to future tax years.

128

The NMTC claimed by Wesbanco Bank with respect to each QEI remain subject to recapture over each QEI’s credit allowance period upon the occurrence of any of the following:
•
if less than substantially all (generally defined as 
85
%) of the QEI proceeds are not used by WBCDC to make qualified low-income community investments;
•
WBCDC ceases to be a CDE; or
•
WBCDC redeems its QEI investment prior to the end of the current credit allowance periods.
As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, none of the above recapture events had occurred, nor in the opinion of management are such events anticipated to occur in the foreseeable future. Approximately half of the tax credits are no longer subject to recapture.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, WBCDC recognized net gains (losses) of $
4
 thousand, $
0.1
 million and ($
1.0
) million on an investment that it made in a start-up firm more than ten years ago that was acquired in 2021 by a public company.  This gain is reported on the Consolidated Income Statements within net gain (loss) on other real estate owned and other assets.

TE 21. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
Certain directors and officers (including their affiliates, families and entities in which they are principal owners) of Wesbanco and its subsidiaries are customers of, or suppliers to, those subsidiaries and have had, and are expected to have, transactions with the subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. In addition, certain directors are also directors or officers of corporations that are customers of, or suppliers to, the Bank and have had, and are expected to have, transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, such transactions are consistent with prudent banking practices and are within applicable banking regulations. Indebtedness of related parties aggregated approximately $
3.0
 million and $
3.3
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024
, $
0.1
 million in related party loans were funded and $
0.4
 million were repaid or no longer related. At 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
no
ne of the outstanding related party loans were past due 
90
 days or more or on non-accrual.  At 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
no
 outstanding related party loans were considered to be an MBEFD.

NO
TE 22. REGULATORY MATTERS
The Federal Reserve Bank is the primary regulator for the parent company, Wesbanco. Wesbanco Bank is a state non-member bank jointly regulated by the FDIC and the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions. Wesbanco is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and is dependent upon dividends from its subsidiary bank, Wesbanco Bank, to provide funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders, fund its current stock repurchase plan and to provide for other cash requirements. The payment of dividends by Wesbanco Bank to Wesbanco is subject to state and federal banking regulations. Under applicable law, bank regulatory agency approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the available retained earnings or exceeds the aggregate of the bank’s net profits (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2024, under FDIC and state of West Virginia regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, a dividend of up to 
$
245.0

million from Wesbanco Bank.
Wesbanco Bank is also required to maintain non-interest bearing reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank did 
no
t have a reserve requirement during 2024 or 2023.

Additionally, Wesbanco and Wesbanco Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements (risk-based capital ratios) administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on Wesbanco’s financial results.
All bank holding companies and banking subsidiaries are required to have common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) of at least 
4.5
%, core capital (“Tier 1”) of at least 
6
% of risk-weighted assets, total capital of at least 
8
% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 
4
%. Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders’ equity; excluding items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, less goodwill and other intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses, subject to limitation, and trust preferred securities. The regulations also define “well-capitalized” levels of CET1, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage capital as 
6.5
%, 
8
%, 
10
%, and 
5
%, respectively. Wesbanco and Wesbanco Bank were categorized as “well-capitalized” under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act at 
December 31, 2024 and

130

2023. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2024 that management believes have changed Wesbanco’s “well-capitalized” category.
The Basel III capital standards, effective January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period ending January 1, 2019, establishes the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act, permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital issued before May 19, 2010 for bank holding companies under $
15
 billion, and increases the capital required for certain categories of assets. A capital conservation buffer is also added to minimum capital standards that is required to be met to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases, certain incentives and other restrictions. Including this capital conservation buffer, minimum levels of CET1, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital are defined as 
7.0
%, 
8.5
% and 
10.5
%, respectively.
Wesbanco currently has $
131.0
 million in junior subordinated debt in its Consolidated Balance Sheets presented as a separate category of long-term debt. For regulatory purposes, trust preferred securities totaling $
126.9
 million, issued by unconsolidated trust subsidiaries of Wesbanco underlying such junior subordinated debt, are considered Tier 2 capital in accordance with current regulatory reporting requirements, as Wesbanco had total consolidated assets above $
15
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  
Also, in March of 2022, Wesbanco completed the issuance of $
150.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures have a fixed rate of 
3.75
% for the first five years and a floating rate for the next five years at Three Month 
SOFR
 plus a spread of 
1.787
%.

On March 26, 2020, regulators issued interim financial rule (“IFR”) “Regulatory Capital Rule: Revised Transition of the Current Expected Losses Methodology for Allowances” in response to the disrupted economic activity from the spread of COVID-19. The IFR provides financial institutions that adopt CECL during 2020 with the option to delay for 
two years
 the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a 
three-year
 transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided by the initial two-year delay (“
five year
 transition”). Wesbanco adopted CECL effective January 1, 2020 and elected to implement the five year transition. Regulatory capital levels without the capital benefit at December 31, 2024 for both the Bank and Wesbanco would have continued to be greater than the amounts needed to be considered “well capitalized”, as the capital benefit approximated 
5
 to 
7
 basis points for three of the four regulatory ratios, while total risk-based capital would have been slightly higher without the transition.

The following table summarizes risk-based capital amounts and ratios for Wesbanco and the Bank:

E 24. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Wesbanco operates 
two
 reportable segments: community banking and trust and investment services.  Wesbanco’s community banking segment offers a wide range of banking products and services through various delivery channels and business units, including commercial demand, individual demand and time deposit accounts; commercial, mortgage and individual installment loans, and certain non-traditional offerings, such as insurance and securities brokerage services.  For purposes of determining the community banking reportable segment, these lines of business are aggregated, in accordance with the review of the CODM.  The trust and investment services segment offers trust services as well as various alternative investment products, including mutual funds, and also serves as investment adviser to a family of mutual funds called the “WesMark Funds.”   The fund family is comprised of the WesMark Large Company Fund, the WesMark Balanced Fund, the WesMark Small Company Fund, the WesMark Government Bond Fund, the WesMark West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund, and the WesMark Tactical Opportunity Fund.  Corporate support functions, which are generally all attributable to the parent company, do not represent a reportable segment and are presented within Corporate Other for purposes of reconciling to the consolidated financials.  All of Wesbanco’s revenue is derived from domestic operations, and Wesbanco has no major customers providing greater than 
10
% of total segment revenue.  
Wesbanco’s CODM is its President and Chief Executive Officer.

The CODM uses net income as the reported measure of segment profit or loss in making business decisions regarding reinvestment into the Company’s segments, using profits for acquisitions and/or paying dividends to shareholders.  In addition, net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results, to perform competitive analysis by benchmarking to peers and as a factor to establish compensation for certain employees.  Wesbanco does not have any material intra-entity sales or transfers.

The market value of trust assets totaled approximately $
6.0
 billion and $
5.4
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  These assets are held by Wesbanco in fiduciary or agency capacities and are not included as assets on Wesbanco’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Therefore, substantially all of Wesbanco’s assets are attributable to the community banking segment.

NOTE 25. SUBS
EQUENT EVENT
On 
February 28, 2025
, Wesbanco completed the acquisition of Premier in an all stock transaction for 
100
% of the outstanding voting equity interests of Premier, with total consideration of approximately $
1.0
 billion. The acquisition of Premier will be considered a business combination and accounted for using the acquisition method. Due to the close proximity of the Premier acquisition date and the Company's filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete, and therefore the Company is unable to disclose the information required by ASC 805, "Business Combinations." Wesbanco will include relevant disclosures as required in the first quarter of 2025.

No changes in Wesbanco's internal control over financial reporting have occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Wesbanco's internal control over financial reporting.
