Item 3. Legal 
Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of business, we are or have been from time to time involved in lawsuits, investigations, proceedings and threats of litigation related to, among other things, our intellectual property estate (including the worldwide patent portfolio we have exclusively licensed from Dr. Charpentier), commercial arrangements and other matters.  Such proceedings may include quasi-litigation, 
inter partes
 administrative proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office or patent offices in other countries, involving our intellectual property estate including the worldwide patent portfolio we have exclusively licensed from Dr. Charpentier. The outcome of any of the foregoing, is inherently uncertain. In addition, litigation and related matters are costly and may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in other activities.  If we were unable to prevail in any such proceedings, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Swiss Tax Considerations

Swiss Withholding Tax

Under present Swiss tax law, dividends due and similar cash or in-kind distributions made by us to a shareholder (including liquidation proceeds and stock dividends) are subject to Swiss federal withholding tax (
Verrechnungssteuer
) (“Withholding Tax”), currently at a rate of 35% (applicable to the gross amount of the taxable distribution). We are obliged to deduct the Withholding Tax from the gross amount of any taxable distribution and to pay the tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration within 30 calendar days of the due date of such distribution. However, the repayment of the nominal value of shares and any repayment of qualifying additional paid-in capital (capital contribution reserves (
Reserven aus Kapitaleinlagen
)) are not subject to the Withholding Tax. The Withholding Tax will also apply to payments (exceeding the respective share capital and used capital contribution reserves) upon a repurchase of shares by us, (i) if our share capital is reduced upon such repurchase (redemption of shares), (ii) if the total of

93

repurchased shares exceeds 10% of our share capital or (iii) if the repurchased shares are not resold within six years after the repurchase. This six year deadline to resell the repurchased shares is suspended for so long as the shares are reserved to cover obligations under convertible bonds, option bonds or employee stock option plans (in the case of employee stock option plans, the maximum suspension is six years). In the event of a taxable share repurchase, Withholding Tax is imposed on the difference between the repurchase price and the sum of the nominal value of the repurchased shares and qualifying additional paid-in capital paid back upon the repurchase.

Swiss resident individuals who hold their shares as private assets (“Resident Private Shareholders”) are in principle eligible for a full refund or credit against income tax of the Withholding Tax if they duly report the underlying income in their income tax return. In addition, (i) corporate and individual shareholders who are resident in Switzerland for tax purposes, (ii) corporate and individual shareholders who are not resident in Switzerland, and who, in each case, hold their shares as part of a trade or business carried on in Switzerland through a permanent establishment with fixed place of business situated in Switzerland for tax purposes and (iii) Swiss resident private individuals who, for income tax purposes, are classified as “professional securities dealers” for reasons of, inter alia, frequent dealing, or leveraged investments, in shares and other securities (collectively, “Domestic Commercial Shareholders”) are in principle eligible for a full refund or credit against income tax of the Withholding Tax if they duly report the underlying income in their income statements or income tax return, as the case may be.

Shareholders who are not resident in Switzerland for tax purposes, and who, during the respective taxation year, have not engaged in a trade or business carried on through a permanent establishment with fixed place of business situated in Switzerland for tax purposes, and who are not subject to corporate or individual income taxation in Switzerland for any other reason (collectively, “Non-Resident Shareholders”) may be entitled to a total or partial refund of the Withholding Tax if the country in which such recipient resides for tax purposes maintains a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland (“Tax Treaty”) and further conditions of such Tax Treaty are met. Non-Resident Shareholders should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty benefits (and the time required for obtaining a refund) may differ from country to country. Non-Resident Shareholders should consult their own legal, financial or tax advisors regarding receipt, ownership, purchases, sale or other dispositions of shares and the procedures for claiming a refund of the Withholding Tax.

Automatic Exchange of Information

The Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (the “AEI”) is a global initiative led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. It aims to establish a universal standard for automatic exchange of tax information and to increase tax transparency.

Jurisdictions that are committed to implement or have implemented the AEI (such as Switzerland, the EU member countries and many other jurisdictions worldwide) require their Reporting Financial Institutions in accordance with the respective local implementing law to determine the tax residence(s) of their account holders and controlling persons (as applicable) and, in case of reportable accounts, report certain identification information, account information and financial information (including the account balance and related payments such as interest, dividends, other income and gross proceeds) to the local tax authority which will then exchange the information received with the tax authorities in the relevant reportable jurisdictions.

A list of the AEI agreements of Switzerland in effect or signed and becoming effective can be found on the website of the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters.

Swiss Federal Stamp Taxes

The issuance of the shares and the sale pursuant to and in the course of an offering is subject to Swiss federal securities issuance stamp tax (
Emissionsabgabe
) of 1% and would be borne by us.

The subsequent purchase or sale of our shares, whether by Resident Private Shareholders, Domestic Commercial Shareholders or Non-Resident Shareholders (secondary market transactions), may be subject to the Swiss federal securities transfer stamp tax (
Umsatzabgabe
) at a current rate of up to 0.15%, calculated on the purchase price or the sale proceeds, respectively, if (i) such transfer occurs through or with a Swiss or Liechtenstein bank or by or with involvement of another Swiss securities dealer as defined in the Swiss federal stamp tax duty act and (ii) no exemption applies.

Swiss Federal, Cantonal and Communal Individual Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax

Non-Resident Shareholder
s

Non-Resident Shareholders are not subject to any Swiss federal, cantonal or communal income tax on dividend payments and similar distributions because of the mere holding of our shares. The same applies for capital gains on the sale of shares. For Withholding Tax consequences, see above.

94

Resident Private Shareholders and Domestic Commercial Shareholders

Resident Private Shareholders who receive dividends and similar cash or in-kind distributions (including liquidation proceeds as well as stock dividends or taxable repurchases of shares as described above), which are not repayments of the nominal value of the shares or qualifying additional paid-in capital, are required to report such receipts in their individual income tax returns and are subject to Swiss federal, cantonal and communal income tax on any net taxable income for the relevant tax period. Furthermore, for Swiss federal individual income tax purposes, dividends and similar distributions as described above are only taxed at 70% on federal level (
Teilbesteuerung
), if the investment amounts to at least 10% of our share capital. On cantonal and communal level similar provisions were introduced but the regulations may vary, depending on the canton of residency.

A gain or a loss by Resident Private Shareholders realized upon the sale or other disposition of shares to a third party will generally be a tax-free private capital gain or a not tax-deductible capital loss, as the case may be.

Domestic Commercial Shareholders who receive dividends and similar cash or in-kind distributions (including liquidation proceeds as well as bonus shares) are required to recognize such payments in their income statements for the relevant tax period and are subject to Swiss federal, cantonal and communal individual or corporate income tax, as the case may be, on any net taxable earnings accumulated (including the dividends) for such period. Domestic Commercial Shareholders who are corporate taxpayers may qualify for participation relief on dividend distributions (
Beteiligungsabzug
), if shares held have a market value of at least CHF 1 million or represent at least 10% of our share capital or give entitlement to at least 10% of our profit and reserves, respectively.

Domestic Commercial Shareholders are required to recognize a gain or loss realized upon the disposal of shares in their income statement for the respective taxation period and are subject to Swiss federal, cantonal and communal individual or corporate income tax, as the case may be, on any net taxable earnings (including the gain or loss realized on the sale or other disposition of shares) for such taxation period. For Domestic Commercial Shareholders who are individual taxpayers, a gain realized upon the disposal of shares is taxed at 70% on federal level (
Teilbesteuerung
), if (i) the investment is held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or qualifies as an opted business asset (
gewillkürtes Geschäftsvermögen
) according to Swiss tax law, (ii) the sold shares reflect an interest in the share capital of a company of at least 10% and (iii) were held for at least one year. On cantonal and communal level similar provisions were introduced, but the regulations may vary depending on the canton of residency. Domestic Commercial Shareholders who are corporate taxpayers may be entitled to participation relief (
Beteiligungsabzug
), if shares sold during the tax period (i) reflect an interest in the share capital of a company of at least 10% or if such shares sold allow for at least 10% of the profit and reserves and (ii) were held for at least one year. The participation relief applies to the difference between the sale proceeds and the initial costs of the participation (
Gestehungskosten
), resulting in the taxation of a recapture of previous write-downs of the participation.

Swiss Wealth Tax and Capital Tax

Non-Resident Shareholders

Non-Resident Shareholders holding our shares are not subject to cantonal and communal wealth or annual capital tax because of the mere holding of such shares.

Resident Private Shareholders and Domestic Commercial Shareholders

Resident Private Shareholders are required to report their shares as part of their private wealth and are subject to cantonal and communal wealth tax. Domestic Commercial Shareholders are required to report their shares as part of their business wealth or taxable capital, as defined, and are subject to cantonal and communal wealth or annual capital tax.

Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

Switzerland has concluded an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to facilitate the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or by means of group requests within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will not be transferred automatically in the absence of consent, and instead will be exchanged only within the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the double taxation agreement between the United States and Switzerland. On October 8, 2014, the Swiss Federal Council approved a mandate for negotiations with the United States on changing the current direct notification-based regime to a regime where the relevant information is sent to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which in turn provides the information to the U.S. tax authorities.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL SWISS TAX CONSIDERATIONS. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR SHAREHOLDER. EACH SHAREHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT IN LIGHT OF THE SHAREHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

Our mission is to create transformative gene-based medicines for serious human diseases. We are a leading gene editing company focused on the development of CRISPR-based therapeutics, including by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary technology for gene editing, the process of precisely altering specific sequences of genomic DNA. We aim to apply this technology to disrupt, delete, correct and insert genes to treat genetic diseases and to engineer advanced cellular therapies. We have advanced this technology from discovery to an approved medicine with unparalleled speed, culminating in the landmark first approval of a CRISPR-based therapy, CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel]), in 2023 with our collaborators at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex. We have established a portfolio of therapeutic programs spanning four core franchises: hemoglobinopathies, CAR T, 
in vivo 
approaches and type 1 diabetes. Depending on the program, we take either an 
ex vivo
 approach, in which we edit cells outside of the human body before administering them to the patient, or an 
in vivo
 editing approach, where we deliver the CRISPR-based therapeutic directly to target cells within the human body.

We continue to innovate on our platform to develop next-generation technologies that can enable new therapies. Through our efforts, we aim to unlock the full potential of CRISPR-based therapeutics to create medicines that can transform people's lives. We believe that our innovative research, translational expertise, and clinical development experience, position us as a leader in the development of CRISPR-based therapeutics and may enable us to create an entirely new class of highly effective and potentially curative therapies for patients with both rare and common diseases for whom current biopharmaceutical approaches have had limited success.

Hemoglobinopathies

CASGEVY

CASGEVY is a non-viral,
 ex vivo
 CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are edited at the erythroid specific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene through a precise double-strand break. This edit results in the production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin in red blood cells, which can compensate for the defective adult hemoglobin in patients with SCD and TDT. CASGEVY is the first therapy to emerge from our strategic partnership with Vertex and is being advanced under a joint development and commercialization agreement between us and Vertex and certain of its affiliates.

In 2023, CASGEVY became the first-ever approved CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy in the world. To date, CASGEVY has been approved in the United States, European Union, Great Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of

96

Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates for the treatment of eligible patients 12 years and older with SCD or TDT. We and Vertex continue to investigate CASGEVY, including (1) three clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CASGEVY in patients 12 to 35 years of age with severe SCD and TDT, respectively, (2) two clinical trials in patients 5 to 11 years of age, one in severe SCD and a second in TDT, and (3) long-term follow-up clinical trials designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after CASGEVY infusion. CASGEVY safety data presented to date is generally consistent with an autologous stem cell transplant and myeloablative conditioning. Efficacy data presented to date support the profile of this therapy as a potential one-time functional cure for people with severe SCD and TDT.

Additional Candidates

We continue to advance our internally developed targeted conditioning program, as well as in vivo hematopoietic stem cell editing approaches utilizing lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery through preclinical studies. Both initiatives could significantly expand the addressable patient populations for SCD and TDT.

CAR T

We believe CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential to create the next generation of CAR T cell therapies that may have a superior product profile and allow broader patient access compared to current autologous therapies. We are advancing several cell therapy programs for oncology and/or autoimmune indications, including two next-generation allogeneic CAR T programs, CTX112 targeting Cluster of Differentiation 19, or CD19, and CTX131 targeting Cluster of Differentiation 70, or CD70. These product candidates incorporate edits designed to enhance CAR T potency, reduce CAR T exhaustion and evade the immune system. An additional edit in CTX131 is designed to prevent CAR T cells from killing other CAR T cells. In addition, these next-generation candidates exhibit increased manufacturing robustness, with a higher and more consistent number of CAR T cells produced per batch. We are producing CTX112 and CTX131 for clinical trials at our internal GMP manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.

CD19 Candidates

CTX112 is being developed for both hematologic malignancies and autoimmune indications. It is being investigated in an ongoing clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, as well as an ongoing clinical trial in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory myositis. Early clinical studies conducted by third parties have shown that CD19-directed autologous CAR T therapy can produce long-lasting remissions in multiple autoimmune indications by deeply depleting B cells. Our first generation allogeneic CD19-directed CAR T program has demonstrated effective depletion of B cells in oncology settings, which supports the potential for CTX112 in autoimmune diseases.

CD70 Candidates

CTX131 is being developed for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. It is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the candidate in adult patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, as well as in hematologic malignancies, including, including T cell lymphomas, or TCL. We believe allogeneic CAR T approaches for TCL may have greater potential to meet the unmet need in this patient population given the patients’ own T cells are not suitable for autologous manufacturing.

Additional candidates

Our CRISPR/Cas9 platform enables us to innovate continuously by incorporating incremental edits into next-generation products. We are advancing several additional investigational CAR T programs, including an autologous, gene-edited CAR T program targeting glypican-3 for the potential treatment of solid tumors.

In Vivo

Our 
in vivo
 gene editing strategy focuses on gene disruption and whole gene correction – the two technologies required to address the vast majority of the most prevalent severe monogenic diseases as well as many common diseases. We have established a leading platform for 
in vivo
 gene editing and are rapidly advancing a broad portfolio of 
in vivo
 programs, supported by an internal  lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, team to enable liver-directed and extrahepatic programs with novel lipids, formulations, and targeting moieties. Our first 
in vivo
 programs target the liver, taking advantage of validated LNP delivery technologies, and aim to treat diseases where we can produce a strong therapeutic effect by safely disrupting a gene with well-understood genetic association.

Cardiovascular disease

Our first two
 in vivo 
programs utilizing our proprietary LNP platform, CTX310 and CTX320, aim to address cardiovascular disease by disrupting the validated targets angiopoietin-like protein 3, or ANGPTL3, and lipoprotein (a), or Lp(a), respectively. CTX310 is being investigated in an ongoing clinical trial targeting ANGPTL3 in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemias, or severe hypertriglyceridemia. In addition,

97

CTX320 is being investigated in an ongoing clinical trial targeting 
LPA
, the gene encoding apo(a), a critical component of Lp(a) in patients with elevated Lp(a), which has shown to have an independent association with major adverse cardiovascular events.

Additional candidates

Building upon CTX310 and CTX320, we are progressing CTX340, targeting angiotensinogen for refractory hypertension, as well as CTX450, targeting 5’-aminolevulinate synthase 1 for acute hepatic porphyria, through preclinical studies. In addition, we have programs focused on gene correction in the liver, including programs leveraging technologies developed by our CRISPR-X research team. Finally, we are pursuing additional delivery technologies, including LNPs, for delivery to tissues beyond the liver, including hematopoietic stem cells.

Type 1 Diabetes

We are developing gene-edited stem cell-derived therapies for the treatment of T1D. We believe our gene editing capabilities have the potential to enable a beta-cell replacement product candidate that may deliver durable benefit to patients without the need for long-term immunosuppression. We have three parallel efforts to achieve this goal:  (1) CTX211, an allogeneic, gene-edited, hypoimmune, stem cell derived product candidate in a device that is implanted into patients and intended to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner, and which is in an ongoing clinical trial; (2) CTX213, a research stage deviceless beta cell replacement product candidate consisting of unencapsulated precursor islet cells derived from edited stem cells; and (3) we have granted a non-exclusive license to certain of our CRISPR/Cas9 intellectual property to Vertex to accelerate Vertex’s development of hypoimmune cell therapies for T1D in exchange for certain milestones and royalties.

CRISPR-X

While we have made significant progress with our current portfolio of programs, we recognize that we need to continue to innovate to unlock the full power of gene editing and bring potentially transformative therapies to even more patients. We have a dedicated early-stage research team called CRISPR-X that focuses on innovating next-generation editing modalities. CRISPR-X is developing technologies to enable whole gene correction and insertion via non-viral DNA delivery and all-RNA systems, without requiring homology-directed repair or viral delivery of DNA.

Partnerships

Given the numerous potential therapeutic applications for CRISPR/Cas9, we have partnered strategically to broaden the indications we can pursue and accelerate development of programs by accessing specific technologies and/or disease-area expertise. We maintain broad partnerships to develop gene editing-based therapeutics in specific disease areas. For additional information regarding certain of these partnerships, please see “
Business—Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations
.”

Hemoglobinopathies.
 In 2015, we partnered with Vertex and entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, which focused on the discovery and development of gene-based treatments for hemoglobinopathies and cystic fibrosis using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. In 2017, Vertex exercised its option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program and we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with Vertex, which we amended and restated in 2021, pursuant to which, among other things, we are co-developing and co-commercializing CASGEVY for TDT and SCD.

Diabetes
. Beginning in 2018, we partnered with ViaCyte, Inc., or ViaCyte (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex), to pursue the discovery, development and commercialization of gene-edited allogeneic stem cell therapies for the treatment of diabetes. In 2023, ViaCyte elected to opt-out of the collaboration with us for the co-development and co-commercialization of gene-edited stem cell therapies for the treatment of diabetes. Per the opt-out terms, the on-going collaboration assets will be wholly owned by us, subject to a royalty on future sales owed to ViaCyte. Our product candidate, CTX211, being developed for the potential treatment of T1D, resulted from this collaboration, and which we are continuing to advance in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Additionally, in 2023, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Vertex for Vertex to utilize certain of our gene-editing intellectual property to exploit certain products for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2 or insulin dependent/requiring diabetes throughout the world. To date, we have recognized revenue of $205 million in upfront and milestone payments and remain eligible to receive additional research and development milestones and royalties on future products under the license.

Other Partnerships
. We have entered into a number of additional collaborations and license agreements in other therapeutic areas, including an additional agreement with Vertex for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy type 1, and others to support and complement our hematopoietic stem cell, CAR T,
 in vivo
 and T1D programs and platform, including agreements with: Nkarta, Inc. to develop and commercialize products leveraging donor-derived, gene-edited CAR-NK cells; Capsida Biotherapeutics, Inc. to develop 
in vivo
 gene editing therapies delivered with engineered adeno-associated virus vectors; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center to advance a gene-edited autologous CAR T program against a new target; MaxCyte, Inc. on 
ex vivo
 delivery for our hemoglobinopathy and CAR T programs; CureVac AG on optimized mRNA constructs and manufacturing for certain 
in vivo
 programs; and KSQ Therapeutics, Inc. on intellectual property for our allogeneic immuno-oncology programs.

Financial Overview

Since our inception in October 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development efforts, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking drug discovery and preclinical development activities, building and protecting our intellectual property estate, establishing internal manufacturing capabilities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through private placements of our preferred shares, common share issuances, convertible loans and payments related to certain of our license and collaboration agreements with strategic partners.

We have a history of recurring losses and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future; however, we have been in a net income position in certain previous years due to certain payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements with Vertex. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue our current research programs and development activities; seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; conduct initial drug application supporting preclinical studies and initiate clinical trials for our product candidates; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any other product candidates we identify and develop; seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; maintain, defend, protect and expand our intellectual property estate; further develop our gene editing platform; hire additional research, clinical and scientific personnel; incur facilities costs associated with such personnel growth; continue to develop internal manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

Revenue recognition

We have not generated any revenue to date from sales of any wholly owned product. During the years ended

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $35.0 million, $370.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of collaboration revenue, which is primarily related to our collaboration and license agreements with Vertex.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we generated $2.3 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of grant revenue related to certain contracts with not-for-profit entities.

For additional information about our revenue recognition policy, see Note 2 and Note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our product discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:

•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense; 

•
costs of services performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf; 

•
costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical activities and in manufacturing preclinical study materials, as well as supplies and materials used to manufacture clinical drug material;

•
consultant fees; 

•
facility costs, including rent, depreciation and maintenance expenses; and 

•
fees and other payments related to acquiring and maintaining licenses under our third-party licensing agreements. 

Our external research and development expenses support our various preclinical and clinical programs, and as such we do not break down external research and development expenses further. Our internal research and development expenses consist of payroll and benefits expenses, facilities expense, and other indirect research and development expenses incurred in support of overall research and development activities and as such are not allocated to a specific development stage or therapeutic area. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development goods or services to be received in the future are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing or estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates we may identify and develop. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:

•
successful completion of preclinical studies and IND-enabling studies; 

•
successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

•
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

•
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity; 

99

•
launching commercial sales of the product, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

•
acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 

•
effectively competing with other therapies and treatment options; 

•
a continued acceptable safety profile following approval; 

•
enforcing and defending intellectual property and proprietary rights and claims; and 

•
achieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidates or the subsequent commercialization of any product candidates we may successfully develop could significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.

Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect to continue to incur research and development costs consistent with research and development at companies of our size and stage of development, which may increase in the foreseeable future as our current development programs progress, new programs are added and we continue to prepare regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and manufacturing expenses for current and future clinical trials.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, human resources and other general and administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.

We expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses consistent with general and administrative functions at research and development companies of our size and stage of development, which may increase in the future to support continued research and development activities, and potential commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, we anticipate ongoing expenses related to the reimbursements of third-party patent related expenses in connection with certain of our in-licensed intellectual property.

Collaboration expense, net

Collaboration expense, net, consists of operating expenses related to the CASGEVY program under our collaboration with Vertex. Under the A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, we have an option to defer our portion of specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of $110.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The $110.3 million for 2023 does not include amounts attributable to our share of certain costs arising from a license agreement between Vertex and a third party, which we agreed to pay to Vertex upon the occurrence of an event specified in Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA and further described in Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we exercised our option to defer our portion of specified costs incurred for the CASGEVY program in excess of the deferral limit. Any deferred amounts are only payable to Vertex as an offset against future profitability of the CASGEVY program and the amounts payable are capped at a specified maximum amount per year.

Other income (net)

Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates—which also would have been reasonable—could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

100

Revenue

Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases and collaboration arrangements. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:

1) Identify the contract with the customer

A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.

2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

3) Determine the transaction price

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones, we determine if it is probable that we will receive such amounts and there is no risk of a significant revenue reversal. When we cannot conclude that receipt of such amounts is probable, we constrain the related variable consideration resulting in its exclusion from transaction consideration. In determining the portion of the transaction consideration to be constrained, we consider the probability and uncertainty that the related research, developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones will be achieved given the nature of research and clinical development and the stage of the underlying programs. This assessment is performed at each reporting period. In making this evaluation, we consider both internal and external information available, including information from industry publications and other relevant factors. Changes to the constraint of variable consideration can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in the period.

4) Allocate the transaction consideration to performance obligations in the contract

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction consideration is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction consideration to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction consideration is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. In determining these estimated standalone selling prices, we make a number of significant judgments including, for licenses, management’s assumptions regarding probability weighted projected discounted cash flows for each of the collaboration development programs. The estimated standalone selling prices are sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as probabilities of scientific success, discount rate and certain assumptions that form the basis of forecasted cash flows. In developing these assumptions, management considers both internal and external information available, including information from other guideline companies within the same industry and other relevant factors. Changes to these assumptions can have a material effect on the allocation of the transaction consideration to performance obligations, as well as the amount and timing of revenue recognized.

5) Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation

We satisfy performance obligations over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer.

Collaboration Arrangements

We record the elements of our collaboration agreements that represent joint operating activities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
, or ASC 808. Accordingly, the elements of the collaboration agreements that represent activities in which both parties are active participants and to which both parties are exposed to the

101

significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities, are recorded as collaborative arrangements.

We evaluate the proper presentation of the commercial activities and the proﬁt and loss sharing associated with the collaboration agreements. ASC 808 states that when payments between parties in a collaborative arrangement are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting literature, the income statement classification should be based on the nature of the arrangement, the nature of its business operations and the contractual terms of the arrangement. To the extent that these payments are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting literature, the income statement classification for the payments shall be based on an analogy to authoritative accounting literature or if there is no appropriate analogy, a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election.

Accrued research and development expenses

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.  Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:

•
CROs in connection with clinical studies;

•
investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;

•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and

•
vendors related to development, manufacturing and distribution of clinical trial materials.

We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.

Collaboration Revenue

Collaboration revenue

was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $370.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was related to Vertex's achievement of a $10.0 million research milestone and $25.0 million research milestone under the Non-Ex License Agreement with Vertex in the fourth quarter of 2024. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was related to (i) the achievement of a $200.0 million milestone in connection with the approval of CASGEVY under our collaboration with Vertex and (ii) an upfront payment of $100.0 million and a milestone achieved of $70.0 million under the Non-Ex License Agreement with Vertex. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of revenue recognized related to Vertex.

Grant Revenue

Grant revenue was $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $320.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $387.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):

The decrease of approximately $66.7 million was primarily attributable to the following:

•
$39.5 million of decreased external research and development costs, primarily associated with a decrease in variable external research and manufacturing costs; 

•
$12.9 million of decreased sublicense and license fees, primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development licenses and milestones due to strategic partners;

•
$7.9 million of decreased facility expenses primarily driven by lower laboratory-related costs; and

•
$7.3 million of decreased employee-related expenses.

103

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $3.2 million was primarily attributable to decreased employee-related expenses and consulting and professional services-related expenses.

Collaboration expense, net

Collaboration expense, net, was $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The decrease of $20.0 million was attributable to our share of certain costs in 2023 arising from a license agreement between Vertex and a third party, which we agreed to pay to Vertex upon the occurrence of an event specified in Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA. No similar costs were incurred in 2024. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of revenue recognized related to Vertex.

In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we exercised our option to defer specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of the deferral limit under A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, resulting in deferred costs of $102.8 million, $80.9 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Any deferred amounts are only payable to Vertex as an offset against future profitability of the CASGEVY program and the amounts payable are capped at a specified maximum amount per year. These deferred costs on the CASGEVY program will be recognized by us when recoverability of such deferred amounts by Vertex is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024, no contingent payments have been accrued to date. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our arrangements with Vertex.

Other income, net

Other income, net, was $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in other income, net, was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We have predominantly incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,903.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $53.8 million was held outside of the United States, and an accumulated deficit of $1,366.0 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect to continue to incur research and development costs and general and administrative expenses, consistent with costs associated with research and development at companies of our size and stage of development, and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources.

At-the-Market Offerings

In August 2019, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement
SM
 with Jefferies under which we were able to offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion through Jefferies, as our sales agent, our common shares, par value of CHF 0.03 per share, or the August 2019 Sales Agreement. In connection with the August 2019 Sales Agreement, as amended, we have filed several prospectus supplements with the SEC to offer and sell, from time to time, common shares. We filed our current prospectus supplement for $378.6 million in August 2024.

In 2022, the sale of common shares pursuant to the 2019 Sales Agreement and the applicable prospectus supplement was not significant.

In 2023, we issued and sold 0.5 million common shares at an average price of $72.32 per share for aggregate proceeds of $32.7 million, which were net of equity issuance costs of $0.4 million. An additional $0.3 million of stamp taxes related to this amount was paid in 2023.

In 2024, we issued and sold 0.4 million common shares at an average price of $55.81 per share for aggregate proceeds of $21.7 million, which were net of equity issuance costs of $0.3 million. An additional $0.2 million of stamp taxes related to this amount was paid in 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, we have common shares having aggregate gross proceeds up to $363.7 million remaining under our current prospectus supplement, and we have issued and sold an aggregate of 1.9 million common shares at an average price of $122.73 per share for aggregate proceeds of $233.2 million, which were net of equity issuance costs of $3.1 million, excluding stamp taxes.

Additional Financings

In February 2024, we entered into an investment agreement for the sale of approximately $280.0 million of our common shares

104

to a group of institutional investors in a registered direct offering, at a price per share of $71.50. We received net proceeds of $279.0 million, excluding stamp taxes due of $2.8 million.

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $260.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by cash received in 2024 from Vertex in connection with the $200.0 million milestone achieved upon regulatory approval of CASGEVY in 2023, offset by increased net losses.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $280.5 million and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities in excess of maturities of marketable securities of $255.4 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $374.6 million and consisted primarily of maturities of marketable securities in excess of purchases of marketable securities of $386.6 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $332.0 million and primarily consisted of net proceeds of approximately $279.0 million from the issuance of common shares in connection with our registered direct offering, net proceeds of approximately $31.2 million from stock option exercises, and net proceeds of approximately $21.7 million from the issuance of common shares in connection with our 2021 ATM. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $62.7 million and consisted of net proceeds of $32.7 million from the issuance of common shares and net proceeds of approximately $29.9 million from stock option exercises.

Funding Requirements

Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, research and development activities, manufacturing activities, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses, patent prosecution filing, defense and intellectual property maintenance costs, and general overhead costs, including costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses consistent with costs associated with research and development at companies of our size and stage of development, which may increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates.

Although we and our partner, Vertex, have received marketing approvals for CASGEVY in certain jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee we and Vertex will receive additional marketing approvals for CASGEVY or we will receive marketing approvals for our other product candidates in the future. Most of our programs are still in early stages of development and the outcome of our efforts is uncertain, and we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, manufacture and commercialization of any current or future product candidates, if approved, or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenues, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity financings, debt financings and payments received in connection with our collaboration and license agreements. We intend to consider opportunities to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities when market conditions are favorable to us to do so. However, the trading prices for our common shares and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common shares or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. In

105

addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common shares. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds through license or collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Outlook

Based on our research and development plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months without giving effect to any additional proceeds we may receive under our license agreements and collaborations, including with Vertex, and any other capital raising transactions we may complete. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Given our need for additional financing to support the long-term clinical development and future commercialization of our programs, as applicable, we intend to consider additional financing opportunities when market terms are favorable to us.

Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many areas, including: developing our delivery technologies and our gene editing technology platform; selecting appropriate product candidates to develop; completing research and preclinical and clinical development of selected product candidates; obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials; developing a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for product candidates; launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor; obtaining market acceptance of our product candidates, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor, if approved, including for CASGEVY; addressing any competing technological and market developments; negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter; maintaining good relationships with our collaborators and licensors; maintaining, defending, protecting and expanding our estate of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.

Contractual and Other Obligations

Operating lease and sublease obligations

Our operating lease obligations primarily consist of lease payments on our office and laboratory facility in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as lease payments on our cell manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, which are described in further detail in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Future contractual payments on operating lease and sublease obligations due within one year of December 31, 2024 are $29.4 million, and future contractual payments on operating lease and sublease obligations due greater than one year from December 31, 2024 are $265.2 million.

Other obligations

Under the A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, we are allowed to defer a portion of our share of costs under the arrangement if spending on the CASGEVY program exceeds specified amounts. Any deferred amounts are only payable to Vertex as an offset against future profitability of the CAGEVY program and the amounts payable are capped at a specified maximum amount per year. Deferred costs associated with the CASGEVY program have not been recognized as of December 31, 2024 because a reasonable estimate of future payments against future profitability cannot be made.

In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts are generally cancelable at any time by us upon less than 180 days’ prior written notice. Certain of these agreements require us to pay milestones to such third parties upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones as further described in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones, which may not be achieved.

We also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain milestones, including future payments to third parties with whom we have entered into research, development and commercialization agreements. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed and determinable.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,903.8 million, primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts invested in U.S. government agency securities. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1%, the fair value of our investment portfolio would increase or decrease by an immaterial amount.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Swiss Franc and British Pound, against the U.S. dollar. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated statement of operations and distort comparisons between periods. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.

Inflation

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, clinical trial and manufacturing costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Item 8. Financial Statement
s and Supplementary Data.

The consolidated financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this report. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accou

Item 9A. Controls
 and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of the assets;

•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

107

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)(COSO). Based on its assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. See below.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CRISPR Therapeutics AG

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CRISPR Therapeutics AG’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, CRISPR Therapeutics AG "the Company" maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CRISPR Therapeutics AG

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CRISPR Therapeutics AG (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Estimation of Variable Consideration for ongoing Collaboration Agreements

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has multiple ongoing collaboration agreements which include rights to future payments in excess of $2 billion as of December 31, 2024 that are payable upon the achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones related to certain programs under development. These future payments represent variable consideration that is included in the transaction price for these collaboration agreements to the extent that the Company determines it is probable that a significant revenue reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. When the Company cannot conclude that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur, the Company constrains the related variable consideration resulting in its exclusion from the transaction price. The Company’s estimation of variable consideration to be constrained impacts the reported amounts of revenue and deferred revenue within the consolidated financial statements.

In determining the portion of the transaction price to be constrained, management considers the probability and uncertainty of whether the related developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the underlying programs. This assessment is performed at each reporting period. In making this evaluation, management considers both internal and external information available including information from industry publications, the stage of development of the underlying programs and other relevant factors. Changes to the constraint of variable consideration can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in the financial reporting period. As a result, auditing the accounting for the application of constraint to variable consideration required auditor judgment.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s revenue recognition process. For example, we tested controls over management's estimation of the total transaction price for its collaboration agreements including those related to the application of constraint to variable consideration associated with future developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones.

To audit the Company’s judgments related to the application of constraint to variable consideration, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company’s judgments related to the probability of achieving the related future developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones. To evaluate the Company’s estimated probability of achieving developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, we considered the nature of clinical development and the stage of development of the underlying programs in relation to relevant external data and assessed the reasonableness of the probabilities of achieving the milestones through inspection of observable third-party information.  We also discussed the probability of achieving the milestones in relation to each program’s phase of development with the personnel involved in oversight of the Company’s collaborations.

CRISPR Therapeutics AG

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

1. Organization and Operations
CRISPR Therapeutics AG (“CRISPR” or the “Company”) was incorporated on 
October 31, 2013
 in Basel, Switzerland. The Company was established to translate CRISPR/Cas9, a genome editing technology, into transformative gene-based medicines for the treatment of serious human diseases. The foundational intellectual property underlying the Company’s operations was licensed to the Company in April 2014. The Company devotes substantially all of its efforts to product research and development activities, initial market development and raisi
ng capital. The Company’s principal offices are in Zug, Switzerland, with the U.S. headquarters for research and development in Boston, Massachusetts, additional research and development based in San Francisco, California, and a cell therapy manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry, including but not limited to, risks of failure of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the need to obtain marketing approval for any drug product candidate that it may identify and develop, the need to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance of its product candidates, third party collaborations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, development by competitors of technological innovations and ability to transition from pilot-scale manufacturing to large-scale production of products.

The Company had an accumulated deficit of $
1,366.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and has financed its operations to date from a series of preferred shares and convertible loan issuances, proceeds obtained from its initial public offering, or IPO, subsequent public offerings of its common shares, at-the-market offerings, as well as upfront fees and milestones received under its collaboration, license and joint venture arrangements. The Company will require additional capital to fund its research and development and ongoing operating expenses.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $
1,903.8
 million. While the Company was in a net income position in certain previous years due to upfront payments associated with the Company's collaborations and license agreements with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and certain of its subsidiaries, or Vertex, the Company has a history of recurring losses and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund current planned operations for at least the next twenty-four months.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation

Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, the Company’s management evaluates its estimates, which include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, equity-based compensation expense and reported amounts of research and development expenses during the period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.

Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in 
one
 operating segment, which is the business of discovering, developing and commercializing therapies derived from or incorporating genome-editing technology. Segment information is further described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The 
majority of the Company’s operations occur in entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Non-U.S. dollar denominated functional currency subsidiaries have assets and liabilities translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect

F-
7

at 
the end of the year. Revenue and expense amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Net foreign currency exchange transaction gains or losses are included in “Other income, net” on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations, the impact of which is not significant.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
298.3
 million and $
389.5
 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.

Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
11.5
 million and $
11.6
 million, respectively, in restricted cash representing letters of credit securing the Company’s obligations under certain leased facilities, as well as certain credit card arrangements. The letters of credit are secured by cash held in a restricted depository account and are included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
.

Marketable Securities
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
1,605.6
 million and $
1,306.2
 million, respectively, in marketable securities. The Company’s investment strategy is focused on capital preservation. The Company invests in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in the Company’s investment policy. The Company classifies marketable securities with a remaining maturity, when purchased, of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Marketable securities are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets if the marketable securities are available to be converted into cash to fund current operations. Marketable securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than one year with a remaining maturity date greater than 
one year
 are classified as non-current assets.
Marketable securities classified as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy consist of corporate equity securities with quoted prices in active markets. Marketable securities classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy generally consist of U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper and prefunded warrants. Debt securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium arising at purchase is amortized to interest expense over the period of the earliest call date, and any discount arising at purchase is accreted to interest income over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses on debt securities are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income, net.
The Company assesses its available-for-sale debt securities under the available-for-sale debt security impairment model in ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements
, or ASC 326, as of each reporting date in order to determine if a portion of any decline in fair value below carrying value recognized on its available-for-sale debt securities is the result of a credit loss. The Company records credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as credit loss expense within other income, net, which is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the security. To date, the Company has not recorded any credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Off-balance Sheet Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company’s cash is held in accounts with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. The Company has not experienced any credit losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the market date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

F-
8

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Items measured at fair value on a recurring basis include marketable securities (see Note 3, 
Marketable Securities
, and Note 4, 
Fair Value Measurement
).

The carrying amount of accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses as reported on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
 approximate fair value, due to the short-term duration of these instruments.
Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed to operations as incurred. Upon disposal, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. 
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are as follows: 

Asset

Estimated useful life

Computer equipment

3
 years

Furniture, fixtures and other

5
 years

Laboratory equipment

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or remaining lease term

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the book values of the assets to future net undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the book value of the assets exceed their fair value, which is measured based on the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
or ASC 606. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases and collaboration arrangements. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:

1) Identify the contract with the customer
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.
2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
3) Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration such as research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones, the Company determines if it is probable that it will receive such amounts and there is no risk of a significant revenue reversal. When the Company cannot conclude that receipt of such amounts is probable, the Company constrains the related variable consideration resulting in its exclusion from transaction consideration. In determining the portion of the transaction consideration to be constrained, the Company considers the probability and uncertainty that the related research, developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones will be achieved given the nature of research and clinical development

F-
9

and the stage of the underlying programs. This assessment is performed at each reporting period. In making this evaluation, the Company considers both internal and external information available, including information from industry publications and other relevant factors. Changes to the constraint of variable consideration can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in the period.

4) Allocate the transaction consideration to performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction consideration is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction consideration to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction consideration is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. In determining these estimated standalone selling prices, the Company makes a number of significant judgments including, for licenses, management’s assumptions regarding probability weighted projected discounted cash flows for each of the collaboration development programs. The estimated standalone selling prices are sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as probabilities of scientific success, discount rate and certain assumptions that form the basis of forecasted cash flows. In developing these assumptions, management considers both internal and external information available, including information from other guideline companies within the same industry and other relevant factors. Changes to these assumptions can have a material effect on the allocation of the transaction consideration to performance obligations, as well as the amount and timing of revenue recognized.

5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company satisfies performance obligations over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer.

Accounts Receivable
The Company's accounts receivable consists primarily of milestones due under its licensing and collaboration agreements accounted for under ASC 606. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, accounts receivable was $
25.0
 million and $
200.0
 million, respectively, related to the achievement of milestones under the Company's license and collaboration agreements with Vertex, as further described in Note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Vertex is a creditworthy entity that maintains an ongoing relationship with the Company and as such, the Company does not have an allowance for estimated credit losses recorded related to these other receivables.

Contract Balances
The Company recognizes a contract asset when the Company transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, excluding any amounts presented as an accounts receivable. A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. Contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, primarily relate to contracts where we have received payment, but we have not yet satisfied the related performance obligations. Contract assets are not significant as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Contract liabilities recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024
 are $
12.3
 million, which was unchanged from 
December 31, 2023
.
Collaboration Arrangements
The Company records the elements of its collaboration agreements that represent joint operating activities in accordance with ASC 808. Accordingly, the elements of the collaboration agreements that represent activities in which both parties are active participants and to which both parties are exposed to the significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities, are recorded as collaborative arrangements.

The Company evaluates the proper presentation of the commercial activities and the proﬁt and loss sharing associated with the collaboration agreements. ASC 808 states that when payments between parties in a collaborative arrangement are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting literature, the income statement classification should be based on the nature of the arrangement, the nature of its business operations and the contractual terms of the arrangement. To the extent that these payments are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting literature, the income statement classification for the payments shall be based on an analogy to authoritative accounting literature or if there is no appropriate analogy, a reasonable, rational and consistently applied accounting policy election.

Collaboration costs specific to CASGEVY under the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements accounted for under ASC 808 are

F-
10

presented within “collaboration expense, net” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 8 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
.
Other Receivables
Amounts due from collaboration partners where activities are accounted for under ASC 808 are considered other receivables and are included within prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Other receivables consisted of $
2.1
 million and $
6.5
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are due from Vertex. Other receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts due under the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements, as further described in Note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vertex is a creditworthy entity that maintains an ongoing relationship with the Company and as such, the Company does not have an allowance for estimated credit losses recorded related to these other receivables.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are charged to expense as costs are incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, clinical study and related clinical manufacturing costs, license and milestone fees, contract services and other related costs. Research and development costs, including up-front fees and milestones paid to collaborators, are also expensed as incurred. In circumstances where amounts have been paid in excess of costs incurred, the Company records a prepaid expense. The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations, clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. The Company recognizes the reimbursement associated with collaborative activities to its collaborative partners, excluding collaboration costs under the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements accounted for under ASC 808, as a reduction to research and development expense in the period the services are provided. Costs associated with collaborative activities to collaborative partners accounted for under ASC 808 and included in research and development expense was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.
Leases
The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases
, or ASC 842. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company does not have any material financing leases.
Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Prospectively, the Company will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.
The Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty of renewal.
Assumptions made by the Company at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.
Equity Based Compensation Expense

The Company’s share-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including directors.

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted.

F-
11

The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards for which performance or service conditions are expected to be satisfied.
The Company’s stock-based awards are subject to service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, directors and non-employees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.
The Company expenses restricted stock unit awards to employees based on the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the associated service period of the award.
The Company estimates the fair value of its option awards to employees, directors and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the calculation of expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate and (iv) expected dividends. In 2023, we changed our calculation for our volatility estimate from using a blend of the Company's data as well as peer company data to using the historical volatility of the Company's publicly traded stock for awards granted during the year. In prior periods, expected volatility was calculated based on a blend of the Company’s reported volatility data for the length of time that market data is available for the Company’s stock and the historical data for a representative group of publicly traded companies, for which historical information is available. For these analyses, the Company selected companies with comparable characteristics to itself including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The Company computed the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its stock-based awards. The Company has estimated the expected term of its employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. The Company has never paid, and does not expect to pay, dividends in the foreseeable future.
Patent Costs

Costs to secure and prosecute patent applications and other legal costs related to the protection of the Company’s intellectual property are expensed as incurred and are classified as general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, or ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated available evidence and concluded that the Company may not realize all the benefit of its deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that the Company does not believe is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company does 
no
t have any significant uncertain tax positions. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Income taxes are further described in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. 

F-
12

Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common equivalent shares outstanding for the period, including any dilutive effect from outstanding stock options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method. See Note 12 for further details.

7. Leases

In May 2020, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a cell therapy manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, or the Framingham Lease, for clinical and commercial production of the Company’s investigational cell therapy product candidates. The Framingham Lease expires in 
March 2036
 and the Company has an option to extend the term of the lease for 
two
 additional seven-year periods. The right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability does not include the additional 
seven-year
 periods under the 
renewal
 option as the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise that option.

In July 2020, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an office and laboratory facility in Boston, Massachusetts, with a commencement date of June 1, 2021, or the 2020 Lease. At lease commencement, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset of $
149.8
 million and a corresponding operating lease liability of $
147.9
 million. Tenant incentives of $
49.2
 million were recorded as a reduction to the operating lease asset and liability at lease commencement. The lease expires in 
March 2034
 and the Company has
 an 
option
 to extend the term of the lease for 
two
 additional five-year periods
. The right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability does not include the additional 
five-year
 periods under the renewal option as the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise that option.

The Company also rents certain office space in Zug, Switzerland, on a short-term basis for which a right-of-use asset and liability are not recorded, in accordance with the practical expedient elected.
The Company has embedded leases in certain research and license agreements for which the Company has recorded a right of use asset and liability. These arrangements are not significant in comparison to the Company’s total operating lease assets and liabilities.

F-
15

The Company identified and assessed the following estimates in recognizing the right-of-use asset and corresponding liability:
•
Expected lease term
: The expected lease term includes noncancelable lease periods and, when applicable, periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, as well as periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.  
•
Incremental borrowing rate
: As the discount rates in the Company’s leases are not implicit, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term.  
The following table summarizes the lease assets and liabilities as of

8. Significant Contracts
Agreements with Vertex
For purposes of this Note 8 and Note 9, CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel]) is referred to as “CASGEVY”.
2015 collaboration

In 2015, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or the 2015 Collaboration Agreement, with Vertex. The 2015 Collaboration Agreement is focused on the use of the Company’s CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. The Company and Vertex amended the 2015 Collaboration Agreement in 2017 and 2019 with Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively, namely to clarify Vertex’s option rights under the 2015 Collaboration Agreement and to modify certain definitions and provisions of the 2015 Collaboration Agreement to make them consistent with the JDA (as defined below) and a strategic collaboration and license agreement from 2019 for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy Type 1. In 2017, Vertex exercised an option granted to it under the 2015 Collaboration Agreement to obtain a co-exclusive license to develop and commercialize hemoglobinopathy and beta-globin targets, and in 2019, Vertex exercised the remaining options granted to it under the 2015 Collaboration Agreement to exclusively license certain collaboration targets developed under the 2015 Collaboration Agreement.
Hemoglobinopathies collaboration

In 2017, following Vertex's exercise of its option to obtain a co-exclusive license to develop and commercialize hemoglobinopathy and beta-globin targets, the Company and Vertex entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement, or the JDA, and agreed for potential hemoglobinopathy treatments, including CASGEVY, the Company and Vertex would share equally all research and development costs and worldwide revenues. In 2021, the Company and Vertex amended and restated the JDA, or the A&R Vertex JDCA (as amended and in effect, from time to time), pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, (a) adjust the governance structure for the collaboration and adjust the responsibilities of each party thereunder, whereby Vertex leads and has all decision making (i.e., control) in relation to the CASGEVY program prospectively; (b) adjust the allocation of net profits and net losses between the parties with respect to CASGEVY only, which will be allocated 
40
% to the Company and 
60
% to Vertex, prospectively; and (c) exclusively license (subject to the Company’s reserved rights to conduct certain activities) certain intellectual property rights to Vertex relating to the specified product candidates and products (including CASGEVY) that may be researched, developed, manufactured and commercialized on a worldwide basis under the A&R Vertex JDCA. Additionally, the A&R Vertex JDCA allows the Company to defer a portion of its share of costs under the arrangement if spending on the CASGEVY program exceeds specified amounts through 2024. In December 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the A&R Vertex JDCA, or Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA, with Vertex related to the global development, manufacturing, and commercialization of CASGEVY. Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA, among other things, the Company and Vertex agreed to (a) allocate certain costs arising from a license agreement with a third party, resulting in a current payment due to Vertex by the Company of $
20.0
 million upon an event specified in Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA, and (b) adjust, under certain specified circumstances, the timing of and portion of the Company’s share of costs it is permitted to defer under the agreement. Any deferred amounts under the A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, are only payable to Vertex as an offset against future profitability of the CASGEVY program and the amounts payable are capped at a specified maximum amount per year.

F-
17

In connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by the A&R Vertex JDCA, the Company received a $
900.0
 million up-front payment from Vertex. Additionally, in December 2023, the Company and Vertex received approval of CASGEVY  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The FDA’s approval of CASGEVY triggered Vertex’s obligation to make a $
200.0
 million milestone payment to the Company.
Letter Agreement

In May 2024, Vertex and the Company entered into a letter agreement, or the Letter Agreement, with respect to the priority review 
voucher issued by the FDA to Vertex as the sponsor of the rare pediatric disease product application for CASGEVY. Vertex and the Company agreed that if Vertex utilizes or transfers the priority review voucher prior to the first calendar year in which the CASGEVY program generates a net profit, Vertex will pay the Company $
43.0
 million or an amount equal to 
42
% of the net proceeds from such transfer, as applicable.  If the CASGEVY program begins generating calendar-year net profits prior to such utilization or transfer, Vertex will instead pay the Company up to $
43.0
 million, set-off by deductions Vertex would otherwise be eligible to take against the CASGEVY program's net profits due to the Company related to amounts deferred previously by the Company.
Collaboration in the field of diabetes

In 2021, the Company and ViaCyte, Inc., or ViaCyte, entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement, or the ViaCyte JDCA, to jointly develop and commercialize product candidates and shared products for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2 or insulin dependent / requiring diabetes throughout the world. In the third quarter of 2022, Vertex acquired ViaCyte, and ViaCyte became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex. In March 2023, (1) the Company and ViaCyte entered into an amendment to the ViaCyte JDCA, or the ViaCyte JDCA Amendment, and adjusted certain rights and obligations of the Company and ViaCyte under the ViaCyte JDCA, and (2) the Company and Vertex entered into a non-exclusive license agreement, or the Non-Ex License Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to license to Vertex, on a non-exclusive basis, certain of its gene editing intellectual property to exploit certain products for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2 or insulin dependent / requiring diabetes throughout the world. Subsequently, ViaCyte elected to opt-out of the ViaCyte JDCA. Per the opt-out terms, the on-going collaboration assets are now wholly owned by the Company, subject to a royalty on future sales owed to ViaCyte. The opt-out became effective in February 2024.
In connection with entering into the Non-Ex License Agreement in 2023, the Company received a $
100.0
 million up front payment from Vertex and subsequently received a $
70.0
 million research milestone achieved in the second quarter of 2023. In 2024, the Company received a $
10.0
 million research milestone achieved in the fourth quarter of 2024 and recorded a receivable of $
25.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 related to an additional research milestone achieved under the Non-Ex License Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company is eligible to receive additional milestone payments under the Non-Ex License Agreement of $
125.0
 million in aggregate, which a
re dependent on the achievement of pre-determined research, development and commercial milestones for certain products utilizing the licensed intellectual property. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive tiered royalties on the sales of certain products in the low to mid-single digits.

Accounting Analysis
For purposes of this Note 8, the 2015 Collaboration Agreement, Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, A&R Vertex JDCA, and Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA are collectively referred to as the “Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements” and the Non-Ex License Agreement and ViaCyte JDCA Amendment are collectively referred to as the “March 2023 Diabetes Agreements.”
The Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements and the March 2023 Diabetes Agreements include components of a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606, collaborative arrangements as defined under ASC 808, 
Collaborative Agreements
, or ASC 808, and research and development costs as defined under ASC 730
, Research and Development,
 or ASC 730. Specifically, with regards to the March 2023 Diabetes Agreements, the Company concluded that the non-exclusive license is a performance obligation under ASC 606 and the ongoing research and development services under the ViaCyte JDCA Amendment are a unit of account under ASC 808.

The Company has determined that recognition criteria for the Letter Agreement has not been met and will not be met until the priority review voucher is (i) utilized or (ii) there is sufficient profitability such that Vertex is obligated to pay the Company under the Letter Agreement.
Accounting Analysis Under ASC 606
March 2023 Diabetes Agreements
Identification of the Contract
The March 2023 Diabetes Agreements were negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective and, as such, the March 2023 Diabetes Agreements were combined for accounting purposes and treated as a single arrangement. The Company determined for accounting purposes that the combined contract terminated the original ViaCyte JDCA and created a new contract.

Identification of Performance Obligations
The Company concluded the transfer of the non-exclusive license, including certain modified rights and obligations provided as part of the ViaCyte JDCA Amendment to support the delivery of the license, was both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract.

Determination of Transaction Price
The initial transaction price was comprised of the upfront payment of $
100.0
 million.
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company adjusted the transaction price to include $
70.0
 million in previously constrained variable consideration related to a research milestone which was achieved in the second quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company adjusted the transaction price to include $
35.0
 million in previously constrained variable considerations related to two research milestones that were achieved in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company determined that all other possible variable consideration resulting from milestones and royalties discussed below was fully constrained as of 
December 31, 2024. The Company will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period.
Allocation of Transaction Price to Performance Obligations
The Company identified one performance obligation for the March 2023 Diabetes Agreements and, as a result, no allocation of the transaction price was required.

Recognition of Revenue
The Company determined the non-exclusive license, including certain modified rights and obligations provided as part of the ViaCyte JDCA Amendment to support the delivery of the license, represented functional intellectual property, as the intellectual property provides Vertex with the ability to perform a function or task in the form of research and development in the field of diabetes. In 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $
100.0
 million for the non-exclusive license at the onset of the arrangement, as this was the point in time in which the non-exclusive license was delivered, as well as revenue of $
70.0
 million from previously constrained variable consideration related to a research milestone achieved in the second quarter of 2023. Revenue recognized under the 
March 2023 Diabetes Agreements
 for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $
170.0
 million.

Revenue recognized under the March 2023 Diabetes Agreements for year ended December 31, 2024
 was $
35.0
 million and related to previously constrained variable consideration related to two research milestones achieved during the fourth quarter of 2024.

F-
19

Milestones under the Non-Ex License Agreement
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company is eligible to receive potential future milestone payments from Vertex of up to $
125.0
 million in the aggregate under the Non-Ex License Agreement depending on the achievement of pre-determined research, development and commercial milestones for certain products utilizing the licensed intellectual property. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive tiered royalties on the sales of certain products in the low to mid-single digits.
Each of the remaining milestones under the Non-Ex License Agreement are fully constrained as of December 31, 2024. There is uncertainty as to whether the events to obtain the research and developmental milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The remaining research, development and regulatory milestones will be constrained until it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Commercial milestones and royalties relate predominantly to a license of intellectual property and are determined by sales or usage-based thresholds. The commercial milestones and royalties are accounted for under the royalty recognition constraint and will be accounted for as constrained variable consideration. The Company applies the royalty recognition constraint for each commercial milestone and will not recognize revenue for each until the subsequent sale of a licensed product (achievement of each) occurs.

Accounting  for the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
Recognition of Revenue
Revenue recognized under the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
 for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $
200.0
 million of previously constrained variable consideration related to a milestone that was achieved upon approval of CASGEVY by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in December 2023. 
No
 revenue was recognized under the 
Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Deferred Revenue
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 there was 
no
 current deferred revenue related to the 
Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was $
12.3
 million of non-current deferred revenue related to the 
Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations was $
12.3
 million.
Milestones under the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
The Company has evaluated the milestones that may be received in connection with the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements.

Under the 2015 Collaboration Agreement and subsequent amendments, the Company is eligible to receive up to $
410.0
 million in additional development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on net product sales for each of the three collaboration targets that Vertex licensed in 2019. Each milestone is payable only once per collaboration target, regardless of the number of products directed to such collaboration target that achieve the relevant milestone event.
The Company is eligible to receive potential future payments of up to $
775.0
 million under a strategic collaboration and license agreement from 2019 for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy Type 1. The Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from this collaboration; however, the Company has the option to forego the DM1 milestones and royalties to co-develop and co-commercialize all DM1 products globally.

The Company has the option to conduct research at its own cost in certain defined areas. If such research is beneficial to the CASGEVY program and CASGEVY ultimately achieves regulatory approval in such areas, the Company could be entitled to receive from Vertex certain milestone payments aggregating to high eight digits.
Each of the remaining milestones described above are fully constrained as of December 31, 2024. There is uncertainty that the events to obtain the research and developmental milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The remaining research, development and regulatory milestones will be constrained until it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Commercial milestones and royalties relate predominantly to a license of intellectual property and are determined by sales or usage-based thresholds. The commercial milestones and royalties are accounted for under the royalty recognition constraint and will be accounted for as constrained variable consideration. The Company applies the royalty recognition constraint for each commercial milestone and will not recognize revenue for each until the subsequent sale of a licensed product (achievement of each) occurs.

Accounting Analysis under ASC 808
Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements
In connection with the Vertex Hemoglobinopathy Agreements, the Company identified the following collaborative elements, which are accounted for under ASC 808: (i) development and commercialization services for shared products, including any transition services related to CASGEVY under the A&R Vertex JDCA; (ii) R&D Services for follow-on products; and (iii) committee participation. The related impact of the cost sharing is included within collaboration expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company recognized $
110.3
 million, $
130.3
 million and $
110.3
 million of collaboration expense, net, related to the CASGEVY program, respectively. Collaboration expense, net, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was net of $
3.2
 million, $
18.0
 million and $
37.8
 million of reimbursements from Vertex related to the 
CASGEVY program, respectively.

Under the A&R Vertex JDCA, the Company has an option to defer its portion of specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of $
110.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Additionally, the Company is permitted, under certain specified circumstances as set forth in Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA, to adjust the timing of and portion of the Company's share of costs it is permitted to defer. The $110.3 million does not include a $
20.0
 million payment to Vertex recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 and paid in the first quarter of 2024 in connection with Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company exercised its option to defer specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of the deferral limit under A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, which is further described in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Intellectual Property Agreements

Charpentier License Agreements
In April 2014, the Company entered into certain technology license agreements with Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier pursuant to which the Company licensed certain intellectual property rights under joint ownership from Dr. Charpentier to develop and commercialize products for the treatment or prevention of human diseases. In connection therewith, Dr. Charpentier is entitled to receive nominal clinical milestone payments, low single digit percentage of sublicensing payments received under any sublicense agreement with a third party, and low single-digit percentage royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products and services by the Company and its affiliates and sublicensees. The Company paid an immaterial amount of fees to Dr. Charpentier under the Charpentier License Agreements.

Research, Manufacturing and License Agreements
The Company has engaged several research institutions and companies to identify new delivery strategies and applications of the Company’s gene editing technology. The Company is also a party to a number of license agreements which require significant upfront payments and may be required to make future royalty payments and potential milestone payments from time to time. In addition, the Company is also a party to intellectual property agreements, which require maintenance and milestone payments from time to time. Further, the Company is a party to a number of manufacturing agreements that require upfront payments for the future performance of services.

In connection with these agreements, on a product-by-product basis, the counterparties are eligible to receive up to low eight-digit potential payments upon specified research, development and regulatory milestones. In addition, on a product-by-product basis, the counterparties are eligible to receive potential commercial milestone payments based on specified annual sales thresholds. The potential payments are low-single digit percentages of the specified annual sales thresholds. The counterparties are also eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on future net sales.

Under certain circumstances and if certain contingent future events occur, Vertex is eligible to receive up to $
395.0
 million in potential specified research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered single-digit percentage royalties on future net sales related to a specified target under an amendment to the 2015 Collaboration Agreement (as such term is defined in Note 8 above). In addition, Vertex has the option to conduct research at its own cost in certain defined areas that, if beneficial to the CASGEVY program and ultimately achieves regulatory approval, could result in the Company owing Vertex certain milestone payments aggregating to high eight digits, subject to certain limitations on the profitability of the CASGEVY program.

Under the A&R Vertex JDCA, the Company has an option to defer specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of $
110.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The $
110.3
 million for 2023 does not include amounts attributable to our share of certain costs arising from a license agreement between Vertex and a third party, which we agreed to pay to Vertex upon the occurrence of an event specified in Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Vertex JDCA.

F-
21

In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company exercised its option to defer specified costs on the CASGEVY program in excess of the deferral limit under A&R Vertex JDCA, as amended, resulting in deferred costs of $
102.8
 million, $
80.9
 million and $
36.1
 million, respectively. Any deferred amounts are only payable to Vertex as an offset against future profitability of the CASGEVY program and the amounts payable are capped at a specified maximum amount per year. These deferred costs on the CASGEVY program will be recognized by us when recoverability of such deferred amounts by Vertex is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
no
 contingent payments have been accrued to date. The Company's arrangements with Vertex are further described in Note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Litigation
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in lawsuits, investigations, proceedings and threats of litigation related to, among other things, the Company’s intellectual property estate (including certain in-licensed intellectual property), commercial arrangements and other matters. Such proceedings may include quasi-litigation, 
inter partes
 administrative proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office and patent offices in other countries involving the Company’s intellectual property estate including certain in-licensed intellectual property. T
he outcome of any of the foregoing is inherently uncertain. In addition, litigation and related matters are costly and may divert the attention of Company’s management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in other activities. If the Company is unable to prevail in any such proceedings, the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.

12. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by adjusting weighted-average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, stock options, unvested restricted common shares and ESPP shares are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for all periods presented as a result of the Company's net loss. The Company’s net loss is net loss attributable to common shareholders for all periods presented.
The Company did not include the securities in the following table in the computation of the net loss per share calculations for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive during each period:

The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Based on the Company’s history of worldwide operating losses, the Company has concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the benefit of its U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company has also provided a valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets that cannot be realized by existing deferred tax liabilities based upon when they are scheduled to reverse. The valuation allowance increased by $
55.1
 million during 
2024, which is primarily attributable to increase in net operating loss carryforwards as a result of current year net loss.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had available non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $
2,982.0
 million of which $
1,489.7
 million relate to Switzerland, $
1,489.7
 million relate to the Canton of Zug, and $
2.6
 million relate to the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom. The net operating losses generated in Switzerland and the Canton of Zug begin to expire in 
2027
 and the net operating losses generated in the United Kingdom can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. domestic federal research and development credit carryforwards of $
29.8
 million that begin to expire in 
2040
 for federal purposes, which are net of uncertain tax positions of $
22.3
 million. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. domestic federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of $
27.0
 million which begin to expire in 
2040
 for federal purposes, which are net of uncertain tax positions of $
11.5
 million. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. domestic state research and development credit carryforwards of $
21.8

million which begin to expire in 
2035
, which are net of uncertain tax positions of $
14.5
 million.
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statement by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
50.0
 million of which $
45.6
 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company will recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense
. As of December 31, 2024, interest and penalties recognized in the Company's financial statements related to uncertain tax positions were not material. A
s of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and 
no
 amounts had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

15. Segment Information
The Company operates and manages its business as 
one
 reportable segment and 
one
 operating segment, which is the business of discovering, developing and commercializing therapies derived from or incorporating genome-editing technology. The Company's chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is the 
chief executive officer
. The CODM assesses performance for the segment and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net loss that is also reported on the consolidated statements of operations.
The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total consolidated assets. All material long-lived assets are located in the United States. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net, and operating lease right-of-use assets.
The CODM uses consolidated net loss to evaluate the Company's spend and monitor budget versus actual results.
 The monitoring of budgeted versus actual results is used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing resource allocation across the organization.
Factors used in determining the reportable segment include the nature of the Company's operating activities, the organizational and reporting structure and the type of information reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources and evaluate financial performance. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table presents reportable segment profit and loss, including significant expense categories, attributable to the Company's reportable segment for the periods presented:
