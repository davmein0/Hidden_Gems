Risk Factor Summary

Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties of which you should be aware before making an investment decision in our business. These risks are discussed more fully in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

•
We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.

•
We will need to raise substantial additional funding, which will dilute our shareholders. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some of our product development programs or commercialization efforts.

•
If we are unable to advance our product candidates to clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.

•
Our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing product candidates are based on a relatively new gene editing technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval, if at all. There have only been a limited number of clinical trials of product candidates based on gene editing technology.

•
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the National Institutes of Health, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have demonstrated caution in their regulation of gene therapy treatments, and ethical and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic testing may result in additional regulations or restrictions on the development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may be difficult to predict.

•
If any of the product candidates we may develop or administration processes we rely on cause undesirable side effects, it could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. 

•
If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.

•
Positive results from early preclinical studies or preliminary results from clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and any future clinical trials of our product candidates. If we cannot replicate the positive results from our earlier preclinical studies of our product candidates in our later preclinical studies, clinical trials and future clinical trials, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates.

•
Adverse public perception of gene editing and cellular therapy products may negatively impact demand for, or regulatory approval of, our product candidates.

•
The commercial success of any of our products or product candidates will depend upon its degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.

•
We face significant competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.

•
We have partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, on our lead program CASGEVY; Vertex has significant control over the CASGEVY program.

•
Gene editing products are novel and may be complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems or regulatory requirements that result in delays in the development, approval or commercialization of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business.

•
Our status as a Swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

•
If we are unable to obtain, maintain or protect intellectual property rights related to our proprietary gene editing technology and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.

•
The intellectual property landscape around gene editing technology, including CRISPR/Cas9, is highly dynamic, and third parties may initiate and prevail in legal proceedings alleging that the patents that we in-license or own are invalid or that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.
