Item 1A. Risk Factors) and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities.  We believe our expected future cash earnings, existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances, and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements both domestically and internationally, in the short-term (i.e. the next 12 months) and in the long-term, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time.  As of March 29, 2025, the Company did not

have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Contractual Cash Obligations 
In our business activities, we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, purchase orders, operating leases and other long-term contracts.  See Note 8 - Revolving Credit Facility, Note 10 - Leases and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, for additional information related to these contractual obligations.  
ITEM 7A.    
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on drawn balances of our Revolving Credit Facility and marketable securities, and to currency movements on non-functional currency assets and liabilities.  We assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures.  All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses as of March 29, 2025.  Actual results may differ materially.
Interest Rate Risk
Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.  The Company’s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company.  These guidelines include security type, credit quality, and maturity, and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Company’s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short-term maturities.  The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio.  Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, our downside exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.
To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve.  Based on investment positions as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 million and $3.5 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively.  Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in U.S. dollars; however, in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we entered into routine transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of certain legal entities outside of the U.S.  
Our balance sheet also reflects monetary assets and liabilities in certain entities which are remeasured to each entity’s functional currency.  W
e use forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange risk attributable to certain non-functional currency balance sheet exposures.  Gains and losses from these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in earnings along with the gains and losses resulting from remeasuring the underlying exposures.  
Because most of the aggregate balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, at the end of any fiscal period a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial pretax currency exchange gain or loss.  See Note 5 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information related to our hedging activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cirrus Logic, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cirrus Logic, Inc. (the Company) as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 29, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 29, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 23, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Inventory valuation
Description of the Matter
At March 29, 2025, the Company’s inventory balance was $299.1 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which includes considerations for inventory becoming obsolete or in excess of management’s forecasted customer unit demand. The Company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted customer unit demand while taking into account product release schedules and product life cycles. The Company also writes down inventory, as appropriate, based on the age and condition of the inventory.
Auditing management’s estimate of excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because management’s determination of whether a write down is warranted is judgmental and the estimate is sensitive to changes in assumptions, including management’s assumptions over forecasted demand which may be impacted by, among other things, future market and economic conditions outside of the Company’s control.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the valuation of inventory. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of forecasted demand, the significant assumptions, and the data underlying the excess and obsolete inventory valuation estimate.
Among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the significant assumptions discussed above, including the forecasted customer unit demand utilized in the estimate, and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management’s calculation. We evaluated adjustments to forecasted demand for specific product considerations and assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by performing a retrospective analysis comparing prior period forecasted demand to actual historical sales.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cirrus Logic, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Cirrus Logic, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cirrus Logic, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 29, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated May 23, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    
Description of Business
Description of Business
Cirrus Logic, Inc. (“Cirrus Logic,” “We,” “Us,” “Our,” or the “Company”) is a leader in low-power, high-precision mixed-signal processing solutions that create innovative user experiences for the world’s top mobile and consumer applications.
We were incorporated in California in 1984, became a public company in 1989, and were reincorporated in the State of Delaware in February 1999.  Our primary facility housing engineering, sales and marketing, and administration functions is located in Austin, Texas.  We also have offices in various other locations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Asia, including the People’s Republic of China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan.  Our common stock, which has been publicly traded since 1989, is listed on the NASDAQ's Global Select Market under the symbol CRUS.
Basis of Presentation
We prepare financial statements on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Saturday in March.  Fiscal years 2025 and 2023 were 52-week years.  Fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week year.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of management estimates.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2.    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, U.S. Government Treasury and Agency instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Leases
We account for leases under ASC 842, 
Leases.  
Our leases generally contain fixed rental payments, with additional variable payments linked to actual common area maintenance costs incurred by the landlord.  These variable payments are not included within the lease liability and right-of-use ("ROU") asset, but are recognized as an expense when incurred.  As our leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company determines the Incremental Borrowing Rate ("IBR") for each lease based on the information available at the commencement date, taking into consideration necessary adjustments for collateral, currency, and lease term.  
Operating leases in excess of 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet, with future lease payments recognized as a liability, measured at present value, and the ROU asset recognized for the lease term.  Lease expense is recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis.  Cost is computed using standard costs, which approximate actual cost.  One of the factors we consistently evaluate in the application of this method is the extent to which products are accepted into the marketplace.  By policy, we evaluate market acceptance based on known business factors and conditions by comparing forecasted customer unit demand for our products over a specific future period, or demand horizon, to quantities on hand at the end of each accounting period.
On a quarterly and annual basis, we analyze inventories on a part-by-part basis.  Product life cycles and the competitive nature of the industry are factors considered in the evaluation of customer unit demand at the end of each quarterly accounting

period.  Inventory on-hand in excess of forecasted demand is considered to have reduced market value and, therefore, the cost basis is adjusted to net realizable value.  Typically, market values for excess or obsolete inventories are considered to be zero.  Inventory charges recorded for excess and obsolete inventory, including scrapped inventory, were $
4.2
 million in fiscal year 2025, related to a combination of quality issues and inventory exceeding demand.  Net inventory reserve releases of $
1.0
 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily related to the sale of previously reserved inventory, offset by charges for excess and obsolete inventory.
Inventories were comprised of the following (in thousands):

Property, Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over estimated economic lives, ranging from 
3
 to 
39
 years.  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life.  Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment are all depreciated over a useful life of 
3
 to 
10
 years, while buildings are depreciated over a period of up to 
39
 years.  In general, our capitalized software is amortized over a useful life of 
3
 years, with capitalized enterprise resource planning software being amortized over a useful life of 
10
 years.  Gains or losses related to retirements or dispositions of fixed assets are recognized in the period incurred.  Additionally, if impairment indicators exist, the Company will assess the carrying value in relation to the calculated fair value of the associated asset.
  There were 
no
 material disposal charges for property, plant and equipment in fiscal years 2025 or 2024.

 million, $
28.1
 million, and $
27.1
 million, respectively.
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.  The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist.  Impairment evaluations involve management’s assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.  If management concludes from its assessment of qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test will be performed involving management estimates of future cash flows.  Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in these evaluations.  Following the quantitative test, an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount the carrying value exceeds the calculated fair value.
  We elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for fiscal year 2025, and based on this assessment, we concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.  The Company has recorded 
no
 goodwill impairment in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.

Table of Contents

Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets include purchased technology licenses and patents that are reported at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 
1
 to 
5
 years.  Acquired intangibles include existing technology, core technology or patents, license agreements, in-process research & development, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements.  These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from 
1
 to 
15
 years.
We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired.  We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts.  We measure any impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount.  We estimate fair value based on discounted future cash flows, quoted market prices, or independent appraisals.  
See Note 7 — Intangibles, net and Goodwill for further detail.  There were 
no
 material intangible asset impairments recorded in fiscal years 2025 or 2024.

Foreign Currency Translation
Some of the Company's subsidiaries utilize the local currency as the functional currency.  The Company’s main entities, including the entities that generate the majority of sales and employ the majority of employees, are U.S. dollar functional.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to material concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and trade accounts receivable.  We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.  By policy, our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities are subject to certain nationally recognized credit standards, issuer concentrations, sovereign risk, and marketability or liquidity considerations.
In evaluating our trade receivables, we perform credit evaluations of our major customers’ financial condition and monitor closely all of our receivables to limit our financial exposure by limiting the length of time and amount of credit extended.  In certain situations, we may require payment in advance or utilize letters of credit to reduce credit risk.  By policy, we establish a reserve for trade accounts receivable based on the type of business in which a customer is engaged, the length of time a trade account receivable is outstanding, and other knowledge that we may possess relating to the probability that a trade receivable is at risk for non-payment.
We had two contract manufacturers aggregated at their parent level, Foxconn and Luxsan, who represented 
41
 percent and 
21
 percent, respectively, of our consolidated gross trade accounts receivable as of the end of fiscal year 2025.  We had three contract manufacturers aggregated at their parent level, Foxconn, Luxshare Precision, and Pegatron, who represented 
43
 percent, 
11
 percent, and 
10
 percent, respectively, of our consolidated gross trade accounts receivable as of the end of fiscal year 2024.  No other distributor or contract manufacturer had receivable balances that represented more than 10 percent of consolidated gross trade accounts receivable as of the end of fiscal year 2025 or 2024.
Since the components we produce are largely proprietary and generally not available from second sources, we consider our end customer to be the entity specifying the use of our component in their design.  These end customers may then purchase our products directly from us, from a distributor, or through a third-party manufacturer contracted to produce their end product.  For fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 
96
 percent, 
95
 percent and 
92
 percent of our net sales, respectively.  For fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had one end customer, Apple Inc., who purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 
89
 percent, 
87
 percent, and 
83
 percent, of the Company’s total net sales, respectively.  No other customer or distributor represented more than 10 percent of net sales in fiscal years 2025, 2024, or 2023.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Performance Obligations
The Company’s single performance obligation is the delivery of promised goods to the customer.  The promised goods are explicitly stated in the customer contract and are comprised of a single type of good.  This performance obligation is satisfied upon transfer of control of the promised goods to the customer, as defined per the shipping terms within the customer’s contract.  The vast majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have an original expected term of one year or less.  
49
Table of Contents

Contract balances 
Payments are typically due within 
30
 to 
60
 days of invoicing and terms do not include a significant financing component or 
noncash consideration.  There have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.  There are no material contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Transaction price 
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer.  Fixed pricing is the consideration that is agreed upon in the customer contract. Variable pricing includes rights of return, price protection and stock rotation.  Rights of return costs are estimated using the "most likely amount" method by reviewing historical returns to determine the most likely customer return rate and applying materiality thresholds.  Price protection includes price adjustments available to certain distributors based upon established book price and a stated adjustment period.  Stock rotation is also available to certain distributors based on a stated maximum of prior billings.  
The Company estimates all variable consideration at the most likely amount which it expects to be entitled.  The estimate is based on current and historical information available to the Company, including recent sales activity and pricing.  Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.  The Company defers all variable consideration that does not meet the revenue recognition criteria.  
Shipping Costs
Our shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of income.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
  Advertising costs were $
0.3
 million, $
0.3
 million, and $
0.5
 million, in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and is recognized as an expense, on a ratable basis, over the vesting period, which is generally between 
1
 and 
4
 years.  Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires the Company to develop estimates used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market stock units.  The Company calculates the grant-date fair value for stock options and market stock units ("MSUs") using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the Monte Carlo simulation, respectively.  The use of valuation models requires the Company to make estimates of assumptions such as expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, and forfeiture rates.  The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ("RSUs") is the market value at grant date multiplied by the number of units.  The grant-date fair value of performance stock units ("PSUs") is the market value at grant date multiplied by the target number of award units.
Income Taxes
We are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  This process involves calculating the actual current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences in the recognition of income or loss for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet.  We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The Company evaluates the ability to realize its deferred tax assets based on all the facts and circumstances, including projections of future taxable income and expiration dates of carryover tax attributes.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves assessing uncertainties with respect to the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction.  We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the required two-step process.  The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.  The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, expirations of statutes of limitation, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.  A change in the recognition step or measurement step would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
50
Table of Contents

Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, we cannot assure that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.  If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax.  We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods.  See Note 17 - Income Taxes for further detail.
Government Assistance 
The Company benefits from the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (“RDE
C”) program in the United Kingdom.  The RDEC is recorded as an offset to research and development expenses in the 
consolidated statements of income
,   $
43.0
 million, $
40.9
 million, and $
26.2
 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.  The RDEC is first settled against the Company's United Kingdom quarterly income tax payments with any remainder paid in cash on an annual basis.  The RDEC receivable as of March 30, 2024 totaled $
27.9
 million, presented within "
Other current Assets
" on the consolidated balance sheets.  There was 
no
 RDEC receivable as of March 29, 2025.  While the duration of RDEC benefits is indefinite, the program is subject to future policy changes and RDEC claims are subject to regular audits by the United Kingdom government.

Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is based on the weighted effect of common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net income by the basic weighted average shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic net income per share calculation, plus the equivalent number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.  These potentially dilutive items consist primarily of outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants.
The following table details the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
  This ASU requires interim and annual disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss, requires interim disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually and requires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.  In the event the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment's profit or loss in assessing performance and allocation of resources, clarification of disclosure requirements is provided.  Additionally, a company with a single reportable segment is required to provide all the disclosures prescribed under this ASU.  The guidance is 
51
Table of Contents

effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  The Company retrospectively adopted this standard for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025.  See Note 18 - Segment Information.  The adoption of this standard had no impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company has determined that the assets and liabilities in the Company’s financial statements that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio.  The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
▪
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
▪
Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
▪
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio consist of money market funds, commercial paper, debt securities, non-U.S government securities, U.S Treasury securities, and securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under the headings cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities.  The Company determines the fair value of its marketable securities portfolio by obtaining non-binding market prices from its third-party pricing providers on the last day of the quarter, whose sources may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value
.
The Company’s long-term revolving facility, described in Note 8 - Revolving Credit Facility, bears interest at a base rate plus applicable margin or forward-looking secured overnight financing rate ("Term SOFR") plus 
10
 basis points plus applicable margin.  As of March 29, 2025, there are 
no
 amounts drawn under the facility and the fair value is 
zero
.
As of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, the Company has no material Level 3 assets or liabilities.  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 measurements for the years ending March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024.

Revolving Credit Facility
On July 8, 2021, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the “Second Amended Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto.  The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $
300
 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  The Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 8, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”).  The Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by all of Cirrus Logic’s material domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors").  The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all the assets of Cirrus Logic and any Subsidiary Guarantors, except for certain excluded assets.
On March 20, 2023, the Company, entered into the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to its Second Amended Credit Agreement, with the lending institutions party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent.  The Amendment updates the benchmark interest rate provisions to replace the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") with the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate ("Term SOFR"), for the purposes of calculating interest under the terms of the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may, at Cirrus Logic’s election, bear interest at either (a) a base rate plus the applicable margin ("Base Rate Loans") or (b) a Term SOFR rate plus a 
10
 basis point credit spread adjustment plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin ranges from 
0
% to 
0.75
% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 
1.00
% to 
1.75
% per annum for SOFR Loans based on the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”).  A Commitment Fee accrues at a rate per annum ranging from 
0.175
% to 
0.275
% (based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio) on the average daily unused portion of the commitment of the lenders.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants providing that (a) the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness (minus up to $
200
 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available on such date) to consolidated EBITDA for the prior four consecutive quarters must not be greater than 
3.00
 to 1.00 (the “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio”) and (b) the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the prior four consecutive quarters to consolidated interest expense paid or payable in cash for the prior four consecutive quarters must not be less than 
3.00
 to 1.00 (the “Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio”).  The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants limiting the Company's or any Subsidiary's ability to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, effect certain fundamental changes, make certain asset dispositions, and make certain restricted payments.  Further, the Second Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.    
As of March 29, 2025, the Company had 
no
 amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and was in compliance with all covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. 
As of March 29, 2025, future interest payment obligations based on forecasted commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows (in thousands):

Equity Compensation
The Company is currently granting equity awards from the 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved by stockholders in August 2018 and subsequently amended and restated on July 26, 2024.  The Plan provides for granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, and bonus stock awards, or any combination of the foregoing.  To date, the Company has granted stock options, restricted stock units, and performance awards (including market stock units and performance stock units).  Each stock option granted reduces the total shares available for grant under the Plan by one share.  Each full value award granted (including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, market stock units, and performance stock units) reduces the total shares available for grant under the Plan by 
1.5
 shares.  Stock options generally vest between 
one
 and 
four years
, and are exercisable for a period of 
ten years
 from the date of grant.  Restricted stock units are generally subject to vesting from 
one
 to 
three years
, depending upon the terms of the grant.  Market stock units are subject to a vesting schedule of 
three years
. Performance stock units are generally subject to vesting from 
one
 to 
three years
, depending upon the terms of the grant.

As of March 29, 2025, there was $
138.7
 million of compensation costs related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, market stock units, and performance stock units granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans not yet recognized in the Company’s financial statements.  The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over
 a weighted average period of 
1.48
 years for stock options, 
1.45
 years for restricted stock units, 
1.92
 years for market stock units, and 
2.16

0.2
 million and $
1.4
 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 respectively. 
Stock Options
We estimate the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using a dividend yield of 
zero
 and the following additional assumptions:

Expected term (in years)

4.33
The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.  The expected stock price volatility is based upon implied volatility from traded options on our stock in the marketplace.  The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding after becoming vested.  The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption.  Finally, we have never paid cash dividends, do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a zero percent dividend yield.
Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the weighted average estimated fair values of stock options granted in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $
54.04
, $
39.61
, and $
42.37
, respectively.
During fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we received a net $
15.4
 million, $
3.3
 million, and $
10.1
 million, respectively, from the exercise of 
0.3
 million, 
0.1
 million, and 
0.2
 million, respectively, stock options granted under the Company’s Stock Plan.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal year 2025, 2024, and 2023, was $
14.7
 million, $
2.8
 million, and $
11.4
 million, respectively.  Intrinsic value represents the difference between the market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of exercise and the strike price of the stock option.

Market Stock Units
Market stock units (“MSUs”) granted prior to February 2024 vest based upon the relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) of the Company as compared to that of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, while MSUs granted after February 2024 vest based on the TSR of the Company as compared to that of the Russell 3000 Index (collectively referred to as the "Indexes".  The requisite service period for these MSUs is also the vesting period, which is 
three years
.  The fair value of each MSU granted was determined on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation, which calculates the present value of the potential outcomes of future stock prices of the Company and the Indexes over the requisite service period.  The fair value is based on the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of the stock price of the Company and the Indexes, the correlation of the stock price of the Company with the Indexes, and the dividend yield.

Performance Stock Units
Performance stock units ("PSUs") consist of performance-based restricted stock units subject to a three-fiscal-year performance period, with annual vesting based on performance achieved each fiscal year.  The number of shares earned is based on the Company’s strategic revenue during fiscal year 2026 and the year-over-year growth of such strategic revenue over fiscal years 2027 and 2028 relative to goals established by the Compensation Committee. PSUs are valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies
Facilities and Equipment Under Operating Lease Agreements
We currently own our corporate headquarters and select surrounding properties.  We lease certain of our other facilities and certain equipment under operating lease agreements, some of which have renewal options.  Certain of these arrangements provide for lease payment increases based upon future fair market rates.  As of March 29, 2025, our principal facilities are located in Austin, Texas and Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.
Total rent expense under operating leases was approximately $
26.2

See Note 10 - Leases for minimum future rental commitments and income under all operating leases as of March 29, 2025.
Capacity Reservation Agreement 
On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into a Capacity Reservation and Wafer Supply Commitment Agreement (the “Capacity Reservation Agreement”) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“GlobalFoundries”) to provide the Company a wafer capacity commitment and wafer pricing for Company products for calendar years 2022-2026 (the “Commitment Period”).  On February 18, 2025, the Capacity Reservation Agreement was amended (the "Amendment") to define the quarterly spread of the remaining wafer quantities under the agreement.
The Capacity Reservation Agreement requires GlobalFoundries to provide, and the Company to purchase, a defined number of wafers on a quarterly basis for the Commitment Period, subject to shortfall payments.  In exchange for GlobalFoundries’ capacity commitment, the Company paid a $
60
 million non-refundable capacity reservation fee, which is amortized over the Commitment Period.  The balance of this reservation fee is $
16
 million as of March 29, 2025, and is recorded in "
Other current assets
" and "
Other assets
" on the consolidated balance sheets within the short-term or long-term classification, as appropriate.  In addition, the Company pre-paid GlobalFoundries $
195
 million for future wafer purchases, which are credited back to the Company as a portion of the price of wafers purchased, which began in the Company's second fiscal quarter of 2024.  The balance of the prepayment is $
68
 million at March 29, 2025, and is currently recorded in "
Prepaid wafers
" and "
Long-term prepaid wafers
" on the consolidated balance sheets.  As of March 29, 2025, the Company estimates its remaining purchase obligation to be approximately $
450
 million of wafers from GlobalFoundries under the Capacity Reservation Agreement.

Table of Contents

Purchase Commitments
We rely primarily on third-party foundries for our wafer manufacturing needs.  With the exception of the terms of the  Capacity Reservation Agreement described above, generally, our foundry agreements do not have volume purchase commitments and primarily provide for purchase commitments based on purchase orders.  Cancellation fees or other charges may apply and are generally dependent upon whether wafers have been started or the stage of the manufacturing process at which the notice of cancellation is given.
In addition to our wafer supply arrangements, we contract with third-party assembly vendors to package the wafer die into finished products.  Assembly and test vendors provide fixed-cost-per-unit pricing, as is common in the semiconductor industry.   
The Company's purchase commitments primarily include the Company's obligations to purchase wafers and related assembly and testing services described above, in addition to future payments related to multi-year tool commitments.  
Total future unconditional purchase commitments as of March 29, 2025 were as follows (in thousands):

Legal Matters
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business activities.  We regularly evaluate the status of legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred and to determine if accruals are appropriate.  We further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of loss can be made.  Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that there are any pending matters that could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Stockholders' Equity
Share Repurchase Program
Beginning in fiscal year 2024, the Company's net stock repurchases are subject to a 1 percent excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act, included as a reduction to accumulated earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.  As of 
March 29, 2025, the Company has accrued approximately $
1.4
 million related to this excise tax.  
Disclosure of repurchased amounts and related average costs below exclude the impact of excise taxes.
In July 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
500
 million of the Company's common stock.  During the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, the Company repurchased 
2.3
 million shares of its common stock under the 2022 authorization for $
261.0
 million, at an average cost of $
112.33
 per share. All of these shares were repurchased in the open market and were funded from existing cash.  All shares of our common stock that were repurchased were retired as of March 29, 2025.  As of March 29, 2025, $
54.1
 million remains available for repurchase under the 2022 authorization.  Additionally, in March 2025, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $

Under the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"), research and development expenses incurred for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 must be capitalized and amortized over five or fifteen years for tax purposes, depending on where the research activities are conducted.  Because the Company elected to treat global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") as a period cost, the capitalization of research and development costs in the computation of GILTI resulted in an increase in the Company's provision for income taxes in fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025.  
The Tax Act also required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax-deferred.  We elected to pay the transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act.  As of March 29, 2025, the remaining balance of our transition tax obligation was $
10.7
 million, which will be paid as the final installment in fiscal year 2026.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated tax impact of temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities.  A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  
At March 29, 2025, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
1.5
 million, all of which are subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2031.  At March 29, 2025 the Company had gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
0.2
 million that do not expire and gross state net operating loss carryforwards of $
6.2
 million that expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2030.  In addition, the Company had $
12.1
 million of state business tax, minimum tax, and research and development tax credit carryforwards.  Certain of these state tax credits will expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2034, and others do not expire.  
The Company maintains a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to certain state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards due to the likelihood that they will expire or go unutilized.  Our valuation allowance decreased by $
33
 thousand in fiscal year 2025, which was the net effect of a gross increase of $
206
 thousand that affected the effective tax rate and a gross decrease of $
239
 thousand that was offset by a corresponding reduction in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.  Management believes that the Company’s results from future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions and of the appropriate character such that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized.
At March 29, 2025, unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that can be distributed without tax consequence,  other than withholding taxes that may apply based on the jurisdiction of the subsidiary, are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested.  We accrued an immaterial amount of withholding taxes on foreign earnings expected to be remitted in the next year due to the planned liquidation of a foreign entity.  No other taxes have been accrued for potential foreign withholding taxes on other foreign earnings as these amounts are not material.  We have not provided additional income taxes for other outside basis differences inherent in our foreign entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.  Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to all other outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable at this time. 
On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner which concluded that the regulations relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in intercompany cost-sharing arrangements were invalid.  In 2016 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit”).  On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that was subsequently withdrawn and a reconstituted panel conferred on the appeal.  On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the U.S. Tax Court and upheld the cost-sharing regulations.  On February 10, 2020, Altera Corp. filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, which was denied by the Supreme Court on June 22, 2020.  Although the issue is now resolved within the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit's opinion is not binding in other circuits.  The potential impact of this issue on the Company, which is not located within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, is unclear at this time.  We will continue to monitor developments related to this issue and the potential impact of those developments on the Company's current and prior fiscal years.

At March 29, 2025, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
32.1
 million, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.  The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits are classified as “
Non-current income taxes
” in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  During fiscal years 2025 and 2024 we recognized interest expense, net of tax, of approximately $
2.8
 million and $
2.4
 million, respectively.  The total amount of interest accrued as of March 29, 2025 was $
12.0
 million.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions including the United Kingdom.  Fiscal years 2017 through 2019 and 2022 through 2025 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  
The Company's fiscal year 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal income tax returns are under examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").  The IRS has proposed adjustments that would increase U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing matters with respect to our U.S. and U.K. affiliated companies.  The final Revenue Agent’s Report asserted additional tax of approximately $
168.3
 million, excluding interest, and imposed penalties of approximately $
63.7
 million.  We do not 
68
Table of Contents

agree with the IRS's positions and have not accrued an additional liability. We intend to vigorously dispute the proposed adjustments.  We are pursuing resolution through the administrative process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and, if necessary, through judicial remedies.  We expect it could take a number of years to reach resolution on these matters.  Although the final resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company believes adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may ultimately result. However, if the IRS prevails in these matters, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in future periods.  The Company is not under an income tax audit in any other major taxing jurisdiction.
18.    
Segment Information 
We determine our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidelines. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has been identified as the CODM under these guidelines.
The Company operates and tracks its results in 
one
 reportable segment, but reports revenue performance in 
two
 product lines: Audio and HPMS.  Our CEO receives and uses enterprise-wide financial information to assess financial performance and allocate resources.  Our product lines have similar characteristics and customers and share operations support functions such as sales, public relations, supply chain management, various research and development and engineering support, in addition to the general and administrative functions of human resources, legal, finance and information technology.  Therefore, there is no complete, discrete financial information maintained for these product lines.  Revenue by product line is disclosed in Note 9 - Revenues.

The CODM allocates resources and evaluates Company performance based on net income.  This information is used to measure profitability, make budgeting and forecasting decisions, monitor performance trends, and to compare actual results to forecasts.  The CODM regularly reviews the consolidated statement of income and a disaggregation of operating expenses, with a focus on personnel-related and product development costs.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based upon the evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 29, 2025.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.  In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, included in Item 8 of this report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
