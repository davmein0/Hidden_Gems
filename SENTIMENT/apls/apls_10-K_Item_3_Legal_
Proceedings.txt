Item 3. Legal 
Proceedings.

On August 2, 2023, Judith M. Soderberg filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the Company (the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting and/or omitting certain material facts related to the design of SYFOVRE’s clinical trials and the risks associated with SYFOVRE’s commercial adoption. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, compensatory damages and equitable relief in favor of the alleged class against all defendants, including interest, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by plaintiffs, including attorneys’ and expert fees.

On October 2, 2023, the defendants moved to transfer the action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

On October 23, 2023, the Court appointed Ray Peleckas and Michigan Laborers’ Pension Fund together as Co-Lead Plaintiffs and assigned the action the caption In Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case 1:23-cv-00834-MN. The Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 8, 2024 (the “Amended Complaint”). The Amended Complaint is brought on behalf of a class of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Apellis common stock between January 28, 2021 and July 28, 2023, inclusive, names the Company and Cedric Francois, our chief executive officer, as defendants, and makes similar allegations, asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the Complaint. On May 17, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware approved the motion to transfer to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint on June 12, 2024, and the Court held oral argument on this motion for November 14, 2024. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion to dismiss.

On December 19, 2024, purported stockholder Patrick Campbell, and on December 30, 2024, purported stockholder Kenneth Olson filed putative stockholder derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of the Company against the Company’s directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste, and alleged violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act related to the design of SYFOVRE’s clinical trials and the risks associated with SYFOVRE’s commercial adoption. The complaints seek monetary and punitive damages, and costs, including attorneys’ fees. On January 21, 2025, the cases were consolidated under the caption 
In re Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Derivative Litigation
, No. 1:24-cv-13128-JEK. By the same order, the Court stayed the stockholder derivative litigation pending the Court’s ruling on the defendants’ motion to dismiss in the securities class action.

The Company’s businesses may also be subject at any time to other commercial disputes, product liability claims, personal injury claims, third-party subpoenas or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property infringement, employment or investor matters, and the Company expects that this will continue to be the case in the future.

For example, in August 2024, an individual filed a civil action against the Company in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging personal injury claims in connection with the use of SYFOVRE. We moved to dismiss this civil action in September 2024. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion to dismiss, as of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

The outcome of the matters described above cannot be predicted with certainty and therefore any loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. However, the Company intends to vigorously defend against these matters.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis o
f Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases with high unmet needs through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system. We believe that this approach has the potential to effectively control diseases with high unmet need and that are driven by excessive complement activation. We currently have two marketed drugs that target C3, the central protein in the complement cascade: SYFOVRE (pegcetacoplan injection), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2023 for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, or GA; and EMPAVELI (pegcetacoplan), approved by the FDA in May 2021 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH.

We believe SYFOVRE has the potential to be the standard of care for patients with GA, a disease that affects an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States. While we have exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights for intravitreal pegcetacoplan, we intend to focus our commercialization efforts in the U.S. and explore international expansion in select markets, including Australia, where we received marketing approval in January 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we generated $611.9 million and $275.2 million in U.S. net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. We are

also developing a next-generation therapy by combining SYFOVRE treatment with APL-3007, which is a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, aimed at comprehensively blocking complement activity in the retina and the choroid. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 multi-dose trial in patients with GA in the second quarter of 2025.

We believe that EMPAVELI has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for a range of indications with high unmet needs. We have exclusive U.S. commercialization rights for EMPAVELI, and our collaboration partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi, has exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated $98.1 million and $91.0 million, respectively, in U.S. net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI for PNH and received $18.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in royalties from our collaboration partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi, which has exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States. We have commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan in the United States.

The next indications we are pursuing with EMPAVELI are C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or IC-MPGN, which together affect an estimated 5,000 people in the United States. We submitted a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA in early 2025, following the positive results from the Phase 3 VALIANT trial investigating systemic pegcetacoplan in adolescent and adult patients with naive and post-transplant recurrence C3G and IC-MPGN that we reported in August 2024. Importantly, the VALIANT study demonstrated positive effects on the three key markers of disease at six months: a 68% reduction in proteinuria in C3G and IC-MPGN patients compared to placebo (p < 0.0001), the primary endpoint. Results were consistent across all subgroups, including disease type, age, and transplant status. Additionally, pegcetacoplan-treated patients achieved stabilization of kidney function (nominal p=0.03), as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a substantial proportion of patients achieved a reduction in C3c staining intensity (nominal p<0.0001). Data also demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability results, consistent with pegcetacoplan’s established profile. Additionally, in February 2025, Sobi received validation for its indication extension application for C3G and IC-MPGN from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.

We plan to initiate two new Phase 3 clinical trials with EMPAVELI in the second half of 2025 for the treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, and delayed graft function, or DGF. Both FSGS and DGF are both rare, severe nephrology conditions with no approved therapies and in which complement overactivation plays a significant role. Sobi is also leading the development of systemic pegcetacoplan for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or HSCT-TMA, in hematology under the collaboration.

 Finally, we are developing new product candidates to further advance our pipeline. Through our collaboration with Beam Therapeutics, Inc., or Beam, we have commenced pre-clinical studies for a treatment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor, orFcRn, which has the potential to be a first-in-class gene editing treatment for future target indications with one-time dosing. We are also developing other programs with our proprietary in-house capabilities.

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, $401.5 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our

94

Table of Contents

collaboration agreement, $532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street Lending Partners, or Sixth Street, and SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group, or SFJ, and $98.8 million relating to the unwinding of certain capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations. To date, we have exchanged $425.4 million and converted $0.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes for shares of our common stock. Our non-dilutive financing activities, which include the Sixth Street Financing Agreement (as defined below), the repayment of our remaining obligations to SFJ and the partial unwinding of our capped call transactions, increased the amount of cash available to us through 2025 by approximately $270.0 million, with the potential for us to access additional short-term liquidity through a second

draw of $100.0 million under the Credit Facility (as defined below).

We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least this year. Our net losses were $197.9 million, $528.6 million, and $652.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3.0 billion.

Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, medical affairs, manufacturing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI for the treatment of PNH and other indications and the commercialization of SYFOVRE for the treatment of GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur these expenses if and as we continue to develop and conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials of pegcetacoplan and our other product candidates; initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for any future product candidates; seek to identify and develop additional product candidates for complement-dependent diseases; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval; require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control, regulatory and scientific personnel; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs and commercialization.

Financing Agreement and Credit Facility

On May 13, 2024, we entered into a financing agreement, or the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, with certain of our material subsidiaries as guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Sixth Street Lending Partners, as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders.

The Sixth Street Financing Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $475.0 million, or the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of $375.0 million at closing and a potential additional $100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a $50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least $180.0 million prior to the $100.0 million draw. We can exercise the option for the additional $100.0 million draw through September 30, 2025, assuming such requirements are met.

The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 (the “Maturity Date”) and bears interest at (i) in the case of SOFR Loans, an annual rate equal to 3-month Term SOFR (subject to 1.00% floor), plus 5.75%, and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans, an annual rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement (subject to 2.00% floor), plus 4.75%. Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility.

The net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility were approximately $358.2 million, net of $16.8 million of issuance costs. We used the majority of the proceeds of the $375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million.

The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. We have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. We are required to repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are subject to a prepayment premium. Repayments may be made after the first year of the loan and are subject to a prepayment premium up to 3% depending on timing.

All obligations under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in substantially all of our assets and assets of our material subsidiaries, including our intellectual property, and are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.

The Sixth Street Financing Agreement contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, a financial covenant to maintain liquidity of at least $50.0 million if our market capitalization is below $3.0 billion, and negative covenants that, subject to

95

Table of Contents

certain exceptions, restrict indebtedness, liens, investments (including acquisitions), fundamental changes, asset sales and licensing transactions, dividends, modifications to material agreements, payment of subordinated indebtedness, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Among other permissions, we are permitted, on terms and conditions set forth on the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to $100.0 million, which amount is increased to $200.0 million upon certain sales or market capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of $400.0 million and 10% of our market capitalization, but not to exceed $600.0 million. We are subject to restrictions on sales and licensing transactions with respect to our core intellectual property, defined to include SYFOVRE, EMPAVELI, and other pegcetacoplan product assets, subject to certain exceptions, including certain transactions related to areas outside the United States and Europe.

The Sixth Street Financing Agreement also contains certain events of default after which loans under the Credit Facility may be due and payable immediately, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, cross-defaults to certain other agreements, judgments against us and our subsidiaries, and change of control.

SFJ Agreement

In 2019, we entered into a development funding agreement (as amended, the “SFJ agreement”) with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group (“SFJ”), under which SFJ agreed to provide funding to us to support the development of pegcetacoplan for the treatment of patients with PNH. Under the SFJ agreement, SFJ paid us an aggregate of $140.0 million between June 2019 and January 2020.

Following regulatory approval for the use of systemic pegcetacoplan as a treatment for PNH by the FDA in May 2021 and by the EMA in December 2021, we became obligated to pay SFJ an aggregate of $460.0 million in payments between 2021 and 2027. We paid SFJ an aggregate of $94.0 million through March 31, 2024.

On May 13, 2024, we used proceeds from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million. The buyout of the SFJ development liability eliminated the remaining $366.0 million in payments to SFJ, including a total of approximately $200.0 million payable in 2024 and 2025.

Convertible Notes

On September 16, 2019, we completed a private offering of convertible notes, or the 2019 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $220.0 million issued pursuant to an indenture, or the Indenture, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.

The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes were approximately $212.9 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of $6.6 million and offering expenses of $0.5 million. We used $28.4 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions in September 2019 described below.

On May 12, 20
20, 
we issued convertible notes, or the 2020 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes were approximately $322.9 million after deducting the purchasers’ discounts and commission of $5.7 million and offering expenses of $0.3 million. We used $43.1 million of the net proceeds from the sale to pay the cost of the additional capped call transactions in May 2020 described below.

The 2019 Conve
rtible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes are referred to together as the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.5% per year payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless converted earlier, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.

The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 25.3405 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $39.4625 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or a notice of redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances as provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, or the Indenture.

Prior to March 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances:

•
during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;

96

Table of Contents

•
during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;

•
 if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or

•
upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the Indenture.

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of December 31, 2024.

On or after March 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election.

As of September 20, 2023, we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide a notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we call any Convertible Notes for redemption, it will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with respect to such Convertible Notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. We have not called for redemption any of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024.

If we undergo a “fundamental change,” as defined in the Indenture, prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

In January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements to modify the conversion terms with certain holders of our Convertible Notes. Under the terms of these exchange agreements, in January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the holders exchanged approximately $126.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes, $201.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, and $98.1 million of 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, in aggregate principal amount held by them for an aggregate of 3,906,869 shares, 5,992,217 shares and 3,027,018 shares, respectively, of common stock we issued. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options,” or ASC 470-20, we accounted for the exchange as an induced conversion based on the short period of time the conversion offer was open and the substantive conversion feature offer. We accounted for the conversion of the debt as an inducement by expensing the fair value of the shares that were issued in excess of the original terms of the Convertible Notes.

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as of December 31, 2023, and as a result the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders until March 31, 2024. No Convertible Notes were converted during this period.

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024 we held in treasury Convertible Notes in principal amount of $425.4 million which notes had not been cancelled.

Capped Call Transactions

In September 2019 and May 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, we entered into capped call transactions with two counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which is initially $39.4625, the conversion price of the Convertible Notes, and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of such Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds $63.14, the cap price of the

97

Table of Contents

capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.

Collaboration Agreement with Sobi

On 
October 27, 2020, we entered into the Sobi collaboration agreement, concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other structurally and functionally similar compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmological administration, collectively referred to as the licensed products. We granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain rights retained by us), sublicensable license of certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the United States. We retained the right to commercialize licensed products in the United States, and, subject to specified limitations, to develop licensed products worldwide for commercialization in the United States. Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, Sobi made an upfront payment of $250.0 million in November 2020, and agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $915.0 million upon the achievement of specified one-time regulatory and commercial milestone events, including a $50.0 million milestone payable following the first regulatory and reimbursement approval of systemic pegcetacoplan in any major European country, and to reimburse us for up to $80.0 million in development costs. Since contract inception, we have recognized $65.0 million in contra-research and development expenses and waived the remaining $15.0 million in connection with the decision to discontinue the CAD program.

The European Commission approved systemic Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan) for the treatment of adults with PNH in December 2021. In March 2022, we earned a $50.0 million payment from Sobi related to the first regulatory and reimbursement milestone in Europe, which we received in April 2022. We are also entitled to receive tiered, double-digit royalties (ranging from high teens to high twenties) on sales of licensed products outside of the United States, subject to customary deductions and third-party payment obligations, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; and (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. We remain responsible for our license fee obligations (including royalty obligations) to the University of Pennsylvania.

Financial Operations Overview

Revenue

Our revenues consist of product sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, and revenues derived from our collaboration arrangement with Sobi.

Revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue using an input or output measure of progress that best depicts the satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation.

Product Revenues

Product revenue is derived from our sales of our commercial products, EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, in the United States
.

Licensing and Collaboration Revenue

Licensing and other revenue is derived from our collaboration agreement with Sobi concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmic administration.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacturing of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, royalties owed to our licensor for such sales, and certain period costs.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:

•
employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense related to individuals performing research and development activities; 

98

Table of Contents

•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct clinical trials and research and development activities on our behalf, and contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture quantities of drug supplies for both our preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

•
the cost of consultants, including share-based compensation expense; and 

•
various other expenses incident to the management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. We have not provided program costs since inception because historically we have not tracked or recorded our research and development expenses by program.

The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from pegcetacoplan or any other potential product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutics, including the uncertainties of:

•
establishing an appropriate safety profile in preclinical studies; 

•
successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials;

•
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;

•
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;

•
launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and

•
an acceptable safety profile of the products following approval.

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.

Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation, consulting and professional fees, marketing and advertising costs, medical affairs and regulatory costs associated with our commercial products, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. Marketing and advertising costs include marketing literature, promotional activities, conferences and seminars, branding and sponsorships.

We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities, potential commercialization of our product candidates and costs of operating as a public company.

Critical Accounting Estimates

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the

99

Table of Contents

basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Product Revenues

We recognize revenue from product sales at the net sales price which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and reflects each of these as a reduction to the revenue. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we may need to adjust its estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period of adjustment. The following are the variable considerations with critical accounting estimates:

Returns
: Consistent with industry practice, we offer SPs and SDs limited product return rights for shipment errors or expiring or defective products; provided that the return is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual distribution agreement. We do not allow product returns for product that has been dispensed to a patient. As we receive inventory reports from SPs and SDs and have visibility into the inventory distribution channel, we are able to make a reasonable estimate of future potential product returns based on this on-hand channel inventory data and sell-through data obtained from SPs and SDs. In arriving at our estimate for product returns, we also consider historical product returns (to the extent available) and the underlying product demand.

GPO Rebates
: Commercial rebates are based on (i) our estimates of end-user purchases through a GPO, (ii) the corresponding contractual rebate percentage tier we expect each GPO to achieve, and (iii) our estimates of the impact of any prospective rebate program changes made by us.

Credit Card 
Fees: SDs will sell downstream to customers who may pay for product via credit card. The Company will reimburse its SDs for the credit card fees incurred as a result of SDs accepting credit cards as a form of payment from the downstream customers. Credit card fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on the average aggregate credit card rate as a percentage of SD sales at the time revenue from the sale is recognized.

Inventory

Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include third-party contract manufacturing, third-party packaging services, labor, overhead, and freight. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory, are made based on the Company’s analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Accrued Research and Development Expenses

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.

100

Table of Contents

We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs and CMOs. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs and CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time-period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting expense amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.

Product Revenue, Net

Our product revenue, net is derived from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE sales in the United States. We recognized $710.0 million and $366.3 million of net product revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net product revenue of $710.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, consists of $98.1 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and $611.9 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The net product revenue of $366.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, consists of $91.0 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and $275.2 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE.

Licensing and Other Revenue

Licensing and other revenue was $71.4 million and $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Licensing and other revenue of $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $53.0 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi, and $18.4 million in royalty revenue from Sobi. Licensing and other revenue of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $10.0 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi, $15.3 million in royalty revenue from Sobi and $5.0 million from collaboration with Sobi.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was $117.7 million and $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase due to higher volume from commercial sales and product provided under our patient assistance programs, a $27.4 million increase due to higher volume of product supplied to Sobi, a $6.0 million increase in royalty expense, a $11.7 million increase in expenses incurred related to excess, obsolete or scrapped inventory, and $8.0 million incurred in connection with the termination of minimum purchase obligations.

Table of Contents

In addition, prior to receiving FDA approval for EMPAVELI on May 14, 2021, the costs associated with the manufacture of EMPAVELI inventory were expensed as incurred as research and development expense. This resulted in inventory being sold during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for which a portion of the costs had been previously expensed prior to FDA approval. We expect this to continue to impact the cost of sales as the remaining pre-FDA inventory is sold to customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the remaining pre-FDA approved inventory was $19.5 million and $26.3 million, which primarily consisted of raw materials.

Research and development expenses decreased by $26.8 million to $327.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $354.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a $34.5 million decrease in compensation and related personnel costs, which was partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in program specific external costs.

The increase in our program-specific external costs of $7.6 million was driven by an increase of $13.9 million as a result of a $15.0 million one-time expense related to the discontinuation of the CAD program and an increase of $7.1 million in GA costs related to development and pre-clinical programs. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease related to C3G and IC-MPGN costs, a $1.6 million decrease in PNH, a $8.6 million decrease in ALS costs due to the discontinuation of the Phase 2 MERIDIAN study, and a $1.3 million decrease in other development and discovery program costs.

The decrease in compensation and related personnel costs of $34.5 million was driven by a $32.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount compared to the prior year and a $1.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million to $501.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $500.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in office expenses, an increase of $1.7 million in factoring fees, an increase of $1.2 million in travel expenses, and an increase of $1.5 million in insurance expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 million in professional and consulting fees and a decrease in personnel related costs of $1.7 million. The decrease in personnel related costs of $1.7 million consisted of a $0.7 million decrease in recruiting expenses and a $10.6 million decrease in salaries and benefits, partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense.

Loss on extinguishment of development liability

102

Table of Contents

We paid our remaining obligations under the SFJ agreement in full in May 2024. We concluded that the development liability was extinguished as of the payoff date. The difference of $1.9 million between the reacquisition price of $326.5 million and the net carrying value of the development liability of $324.6 million was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of the development liability as of December 31, 2024.

Interest Income

Interest income was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $8.1 million, compared to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to decreased investments and a decline in money market rates during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $10.8 million, compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the interest incurred under the Credit Facility and was partially offset by a decrease in the balance of the development liability.

Other (Expense)/ Income, Net

Other expense was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to other expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to foreign currency revaluation losses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to state taxes.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

A discussion of changes in our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), which discussion is incorporated herein by reference, and which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, $401.5 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our collaboration agreement, $532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street and SFJ, and $98.8 million relating to the unwinding of the capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations.

In May 2024, we entered into the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, which provides for the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of $375.0 million at closing and a potential additional $100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a $50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least $180.0 million prior to the $100.0 million draw. The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 and bears interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) + 5.75% (subject to 1.00% floor). Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. We used the majority of the proceeds of the $375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million.

We are permitted under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to $100.0 million, which amount is increased to $200.0 million upon certain sales or market

capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of $400.0 million and 10% of our market capitalization, but not to exceed $600.0 million.

In August 2024, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Factoring Agreement") to sell certain accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution at a discount to the face value of the accounts receivable. Under the Factoring Agreement, the maximum amount of outstanding accounts receivables sold at any time is $100.0 million.

In November 2023, we entered into a sales agreement, or the sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, as agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering from of up to $300.0 million from time to time. Any sales made under the sales agreement will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Any sales under the sales agreement will be made pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3, which became effective on February 22, 2023. We agreed to pay Cowen compensation of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sale of shares made under the sales agreement. We did not make any sales under the sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024.

In February 2023, we issued and sold 4,007,936 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock to investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,380,956 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering, including 833,333 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The price to the public of the shares of common stock was $63.00 per share and the price to the public of the pre-funded warrants was $62.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price equal to $0.0001 per share and do not expire. The pre-funded warrants were accounted for as equity instruments. We received total net proceeds of $384.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $18.8 million and offering cost of $0.3 million. For the period ended December 31, 2024 2,299,991

shares of common stocks were issued from the exercise of pre-funded warrants. As of December 31, 2024, pre-funded warrants to purchase 80,956 shares of our common stock were still outstanding.

 In February 2024, we entered into agreements with the capped call counterparties to unwind a portion of the capped call transactions. The unwind agreements applied to the portion of the capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the $426.1 million principal amount of Convertible Notes that we held in treasury as of December 31, 2024 or have been previously converted. The unwind transactions were settled at volume-weighted average price per share of $64.11, which resulted in cash proceeds to us of $98.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining capped call transactions had a notional amount corresponding to $93.9 million principal amount of Convertible Notes.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $197.9 million adjusted for $128.4 million of non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $114.1 million, depreciation expense of $1.8 million, loss on extinguishment of development liability of $1.9 million and accretion of discount to the development liability of $8.9 million. Further, it included a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of $18.4 million, which was driven by an increases in accounts receivable of $58.5 million, an increase in inventory of $10.8 million, a decrease in prepaid assets of $20.4 million, a decrease in other current assets of $10.8 million, an increase in accounts payable of $1.1 million, and an increase in accrued expenses of $18.2 million. The change in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the derecognition of certain accounts receivable under our Factoring Agreement.

Net cash used in operating activities was $594.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $528.6 million adjusted for $134.1 million of non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $105.9 million, depreciation expense of $1.8 million, accretion of discount to the development liability of $26.0 million and accretion of discounts for

convertible debt of $0.3 million. Further, it included a net increase in operating assets of $200.2 million, which was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $198.7 million, an increase in inventory of $60.6 million, and an increase in prepaid assets of $1.9 million, which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $35.1 million and a decrease in other assets of $25.9 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.4 million due primarily to purchases of fixed assets.

Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.7 million due primarily to purchases of fixed assets and partially offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $149.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility of $358.2 million, the settlement of capped call unwind transactions of $98.8 million, $14.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $4.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by repayment of $326.5 million for the development liability.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $394.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and consisted primarily of proceeds from the follow-on common stock and pre-funded warrant offering in March 2023 of $384.4 million, $71.3 million proceeds upon the exercise of stock options and $5.4 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments of $55.5 million for the development liability as well as the payments of employee tax withholding related to equity-based compensation of $11.0 million.

Funding Requirements

We expect to continue incur expenses to support our ongoing commercial activities related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of EMPAVELI for PNH and SYFOVRE for GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses as we prioritize the ongoing development of systemic pegcetacoplan and focus our research initiatives on high potential opportunities.

Together with the cash that we anticipate will be generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, as well as our anticipated longer-term cash requirements and obligations. Our expectations regarding our short-term and long-term funding requirements are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may need additional capital resources to fund our operating plans and capital expenditure requirements.

We are devoting substantial resources to the commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA. We are also devoting substantial resources to the development of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE and development of other product candidates, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for any of these activities is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with the research, development and commercialization. Our future funding requirements and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including
:

•
our ability to continue to successfully commercialize and sell EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States;

•
the cost of and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of SYFOVRE outside of the United States and continue to build a commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA in the United States and worldwide;

•
the cost of and our ability to effectively establish and maintain, the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities required to support the continued commercialization of EMPAVELI, SYFOVRE and any other products for which we receive marketing approval including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution;

•
the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for systemic pegcetacoplan, SYFOVRE and our other product candidates;

•
our ability to maintain a productive collaborative relationship with Sobi with respect to systemic pegcetacoplan, including our ability to achieve milestone payments under our agreement with Sobi;

•
our ability to identify additional collaborators for any of our product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates;

the effect of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, on the healthcare system and the economy generally and on our clinical trials and other operations specifically;

•
our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States or any other product we commercialize; and

•
the costs of operating as a public company.

If our cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE are not sufficient to fund our planned expenditures, we will need to finance our cash needs through external sources of funds, which may include equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds.

If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, or raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

We have entered into contracts to conduct research and development activities with third parties which commit us to pay future milestone payments or to pay royalty fees if any of the research results in regulatory approval or commercial revenue for a product. The scope of the services under the research and development contracts can be modified and the contracts cancelled by us upon

written notice. In some instances, the contracts may be cancelled by the third party upon written notice. If we were to cancel these contracts, we would be required only to pay for activities incurred through termination date.

We are a party to a license agreement with Penn for an exclusive, worldwide license to specified patent rights in the ophthalmic field of use. We are required to make milestone payments aggregating up to $3.2 million based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $5.0 million based upon the achievement of specified annual sales milestones with respect to each licensed product, and to pay low single-digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product and with minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees.

In April 2023, we paid $2.3 million for the achievement of a regulatory milestone as a result of the FDA approval of SYFOVRE in February 2023. In 2023, we incurred $5.0 million as a result of the achievement of sales milestones for SYFOVRE of which we paid $2.0 million in October 2023 and the remaining $3.0 million in January 2024.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, we have incurred royalty expense of $19.8 million and $8.9 million on sales of SYFOVRE, which is included in cost of sales

on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

In addition, we are a party to a license agreement with Penn for an exclusive, worldwide license to specified patent rights for the development and commercialization of products in nonophthalmic fields of use, as defined therein. We are required to make milestone payments aggregating up to $1.7 million, based upon the achievement of development and regulatory approval milestones, and up to $2.5 million, based upon the achievement of annual sales milestones with respect to each of the first two licensed products. The license agreement also requires us to pay low single digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product, subject to minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees.

In January 2021, we paid $25.0 million for a sublicense fee owed to Penn related to the Sobi collaboration agreement and another licensing transaction. In August 2021, we paid $1.0 million to Penn upon the achievement of a development milestone, net of a credit for the annual license maintenance payment. In June 2022, we paid an additional $5.0 million to Penn as a sublicense fee upon the achievement of a development milestone under the Sobi collaboration. In January 2023, we paid $1.0 million to Penn upon the achievement of a sales milestone for EMPAVELI in 2022. In January 2024, we paid $0.5 million for a sublicense fee owed to Penn related to Sobi obtaining regulatory approval in Japan. Additionally, in January 2024, we paid $1.5 million as a result of the achievement of a sales milestone for EMPAVELI and Aspaveli.

As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we have incurred royalty expense of $6.4 million, $4.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, on sales of EMPAVELI and Aspaveli, which is included in cost of sales

on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since either the contracts are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice to the CRO, or the noncancelable minimum purchase commitments under such contracts have already been satisfied.

We have certain non-cancelable purchase obligations related to the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product. We have agreed to purchase from Bachem Americas, Inc. a significant portion of its requirements for the pegcetacoplan drug substance. Under a commercial supply agreement with NOF Corporation ("NOF"), we have agreed to purchase activated polyethylene glycol derivative, or PEG, which is a component of pegcetacoplan. In September 2024, we terminated the minimum purchase obligation with NOF for 2025. Under these agreements, as of December 31, 2024 we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $45.7 million to these vendors. As a result of this termination, the Company incurred an expense of $6.4 million, which is included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As the amount is not due until January 2026, it is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.

In addition, the Company has other non-cancelable purchase agreements as of December 31, 2024, under which it is obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $10.7 million to vendors.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita
tive Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $411.3 million, consisting primarily of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Inventory Valuation – Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which requires the Company to eliminate any intercompany profit in inventory. In addition, the Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period and writes down any excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. Provisions for slow-moving, excess or obsolete inventories are made based on the Company’s analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts.

We identified the valuation of inventory as a critical audit matter due the extent of effort required by the Company to eliminate intercompany profit in inventory and the significant estimates and assumptions used by management to determine excess and obsolescence write downs, including the determination of expected future sales. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the methodology and the reasonableness of assumptions.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to valuation of inventory included the following, among others:

109

Table of Contents

•
We performed procedures to evaluate the reasonableness and consistency of management’s methods used to eliminate intercompany profit, which included testing the accuracy and completeness of underlying data used in management’s calculation;

•
We independently recalculated the value of inventory to ensure the accuracy and completeness of intercompany profit eliminations;

•
We evaluated the Company’s estimate for excess and obsolete inventory by performing the following:

o
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions, and judgments used in developing their estimate, which included consideration of expected future sales, product dating and historical obsolescence experience, and information obtained from the supply chain personnel regarding inventory at risk for excess and obsolescence. 

o
We tested the calculation of the excess and obsolete provision pursuant to the Company’s policy, on a sample basis, including the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the Company’s calculation.

o
We performed a retrospective review by comparing management’s prior year estimates of product revenues with actual product revenues in the current year to identify any potential bias.

o
We held discussions with financial and operational management to determine whether any strategic, regulatory, or operational changes in the business were consistent with the projections of future demand that were utilized in estimating the provision recorded.

•
We tested the design and effectiveness of controls over inventory valuation, including those over the estimation of provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the intercompany profit elimination.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Nature of Organization and Operations

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases with high unmet needs through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system, at the level of C3, the central protein in the complement cascade.
The Company was incorporated in September 2009 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company’s principal executive offices are located in Waltham, Massachusetts.
The Company’s operations since inception have included organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring rights to product candidates, business planning, raising capital, developing its product candidates, commercializing EMPAVELI (pegcetacoplan) for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and commercializing SYFOVRE (pegcetacoplan injection) for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration (“GA”).
The Company is subject to risks common in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, its ability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of product candidates and receive timely regulatory approval of products, market acceptance of the Company’s products, protection of proprietary technology, healthcare cost containment initiatives, and compliance with governmental regulations, including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).

Follow-on Public Offerings
On February 22, 2023, the Company issued and sold 
4,007,936
 shares of common stock and, in lieu of common stock to investor who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 
2,380,956
 shares of common stock in a follow-on offering, including 
833,333
 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The price to the public of the shares of common stock was $
63.00
 per share and the price to the public of the pre-funded warrants was $
62.9999
 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price equal to $
0.0001
 per share and do not expire. The pre-funded warrants were accounted for as equity instruments. The Company received total net proceeds of $
384.4
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
18.8
 million and offering costs of $
0.3
 million. For the period ended December 31, 2024, 
2,299,991
 shares of common stock were issued from the exercise of pre-funded warrants. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has pre-funded warrants to purchase 
80,956
 shares of our common stock outstanding.
On March 28, 2022, the Company issued and sold 
8,563,830
 shares of its common stock at a price per share to the public of $
47.00
 in a follow-on public offering including an additional 
1,117,021
 shares of its common stock that were sold at the follow-on public offering price of $
47.00
 per share pursuant to the underwriters’ 
agreement in full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
 $
380.1
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $
22.1
 million and offering costs of $
0.3
 million for these transactions.
Liquidity and Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. From inception to December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred cash outflows from operations, losses from operations, and had an accumulated deficit of 
$
3.0
 billion
, primarily as a result of expenses incurred through a combination of research and development activities related to the Company’s various product candidates and expenses supporting those activities and expenses incurred in connection with product launches and commercialization costs.
The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents of 
$
411.3
 million
 at December 31, 2024 combined with cash anticipated to be generated from sales of EMPAVELI and from SYFOVRE will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenues consist of product sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE and revenue derived from its collaboration arrangement with

Sobi. See Note 11, License and Collaboration Agreements for further discussion related to the Sobi Collaboration and License Agreement.
The Company accounts for contracts with its customers in accordance with ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (
“ASC 606”). Pursuant to ASC 606, for arrangements or transactions between participants determined to be within the scope of the contracts with customers guidance, the Company performs the following five steps to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue using an input or output measure of progress that best depicts the satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation.
Product Revenue

The Company’s revenue from net product sales was generated in the United States following the FDA’s approval for marketing of EMPAVELI for the treatment of PNH in May 2021 and SYFOVRE in February 2023. The Company sells EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE principally through arrangements with specialty pharmacies (“SPs”) and specialty distributors (“SDs”), who are the Company’s customers. The customers subsequently resell the product to patients and health care providers. The Company applies the ASC 606 five step process discussed above to the contracts with SPs and SDs. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the product, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customers.
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the net sales price which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and reflects each of these as a reduction to revenue. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust its estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period of adjustment. The following are the Company’s significant categories of variable consideration:
Fees

Distribution Fees: Distribution fees include distribution service fees paid to SDs based on a contractually fixed percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). These fees are directly related to the storage, handling and distribution of product to customers, and are therefore inseparable from the product. Distribution fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on contractual terms at the time revenue from the sale is recognized.
Credit Card Fees: SDs will sell downstream to customers who may pay for product via credit card. The Company will reimburse its SDs for the credit card fees incurred as a result of SDs accepting credit cards as a form of payment from the downstream customers. Credit card fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on the average aggregate credit card rate as a percentage of SD sales at the time revenue from the sale is recognized.

Patient Assistance

Copay: Other incentives include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the Company's co-pay assistance program, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially-insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by

117

Table of Contents

payors. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.
The Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom the Company will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program.

Rebates
Government Rebates: The Company’s products are subject to pricing limits under certain federal government programs. Qualifying entities (i.e., end-users) purchase products from the Company’s customers at their qualifying discounted price. The chargeback amount the Company incurs represents the difference between the Company’s contractual sales price to the customer, and the end-user’s applicable discounted purchase price under the government program.

Other Rebates:

The Company contracts with certain payor organizations, primarily group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of the Company's products. The Company estimates these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.

Group purchasing organizations purchase from SDs at a discounted price. SDs charge back to the Company the difference between the price initially paid by SDs and the discounted price paid to SDs by the GPOs. The Company issues credit notes for the chargeback which are applied to future sales.
Returns

Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers SPs and SDs limited product return rights for shipment errors or expiring or defective products; provided that the return is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual distribution agreement. The Company does not allow product returns for product that has been dispensed to a patient. As the Company receives inventory reports from SPs and SDs and has visibility into the inventory distribution channel, it is able to make a reasonable estimate of future potential product returns based on this on-hand channel inventory data and sell-through data obtained from SPs and SDs. In arriving at its estimate for product returns, the Company also considers historical product returns (to the extent available) and the underlying product demand.
Licensing and Collaboration Revenue

The Company analyzes license and collaboration arrangements pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangement Guidance and Considerations,
 (“ASC 808”) to assess whether such arrangements, or transactions between arrangement participants, involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities or are more akin to a vendor-customer relationship. In making this evaluation, the Company considers whether the activities of the collaboration are considered to be distinct and deemed to be within the scope of the collaborative arrangement guidance or if they are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of ASC 606. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement.
For elements of collaboration arrangements that are not accounted for pursuant to guidance in ASC 606, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to the revenue from contracts with customers guidance. Amounts related to transactions with a counterparty in a collaborative arrangement that is not a customer are presented as collaboration revenue and in a separate line item from revenue recognized from contracts with customers, if any, in the consolidated statements of operations.
Pursuant to ASC 606, for arrangements or transactions between arrangement participants determined to be within the scope of the contracts with customers guidance, the Company performs the five-step process discussed above to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations.
We evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of potential transaction price and the likelihood that the transaction price will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is

118

Table of Contents

included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The Company has not currently identified any such material rights.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue using an input or output measure of progress that best depicts the satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation.
After contract inception, the transaction price is reassessed at every period end and updated for changes such as resolution of uncertain events. Any change in the overall transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations on the same methodology as at contract inception.

Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer (“CEO”). The Company manages its operations as a single operating segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for additional information.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes, and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Estimates are used in the following areas, among others: accrued research and development expenses, reserves for variable consideration and reserves for excess or obsolete inventories.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company is required to disclose information on the fair value of financial instruments and inputs that enable an assessment of the fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy prioritize valuation inputs based upon the observable nature of those inputs as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s financial instruments, in addition to those presented in Note 8, Long-term Debt, and Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Management believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in banks and investment instruments having maturities of three months or less from their acquisition date.

Accounts Receivable

119

Table of Contents

The Company’s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s SPs or SDs. The Company has had no historical write offs of its accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and its payment terms are generally 30-65 days for EMPAVELI and 60-150 days for SYFOVRE. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers and provides reserves against trade receivables for expected credit losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the credit profiles for the Company’s customers were deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for credit losses was not considered necessary.
The Company has an agreement (the “Factoring Agreement”) to sell certain trade accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution at a discount to the invoiced amount. Under the Factoring Agreement, the maximum amount of outstanding accounts receivables sold at any time is $
100.0
 million. The Company accounts for the transfer of trade accounts receivable under the Factoring Agreement as a sale in accordance with ASC 860, 
Transfers and Servicing
, because effective control and risk associated with the transferred accounts receivable is passed to the third-party. Accordingly, the Company derecognizes the sold trade accounts receivable from the consolidated balance sheets. Cash proceeds related to the accounts receivable sold are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Any discounts or fees incurred in connection with the sales are recorded within “Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, the Company performs certain collection and administrative functions for the receivable sold. The fair value of these administrative services is not material and therefore, the Company has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities associated with the Factoring Agreement. See Note 3, Product Revenues, Accounts Receivable, and Reserves for Product Sales, for additional information.

Inventory

Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include third-party contract manufacturing, third-party packaging services, labor, overhead and freight. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of inventory during each reporting period, and it writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory, are made based on the Company’s analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Inventory not expected to be sold within the Company’s normal operating cycle is classified as long-term inventory on the consolidated balance sheet.

Prior to regulatory approval of its product candidates, the Company expensed costs associated with the manufacturing of its product candidates to research and development expense unless the Company was reasonably certain such costs have future commercial use and net realizable value. When the Company believes regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of its product candidates is probable, and the Company also expects future economic benefit from the sales of the product candidates to be realized, the Company will then capitalize the costs of production as inventory. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial product is expensed as research and development expense when selected for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.

Shipping and handling costs for product shipments are recorded as incurred in cost of sales along with costs associated with manufacturing the product and any inventory write-downs.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of each of the Company’s subsidiaries is its local currency, except for the wholly owned subsidiaries Apellis Europe B.V. and Apellis International GmbH where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Revenues and expenses of the subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Research and Development

Costs incurred in connection with research and development activities are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include (i) employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense; (ii)

120

Table of Contents

external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research and contract manufacturing organizations, investigational sites and consultants, including share-based compensation expense for consultants; (iii) the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials; and (iv) costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations.

The Company enters into consulting, research and other agreements with commercial entities, researchers, universities and others for the provision of goods and services. Such arrangements are generally cancellable upon reasonable notice and payment of costs incurred. Costs are considered incurred based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks under each contract using information and data provided by the Company’s clinical sites and vendors. These costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects, as well as fees paid to various entities that perform certain research on behalf of the Company.

Depending upon the timing of payments to the service providers, the Company recognizes prepaid expenses or accrued expenses related to these costs. These accrued or prepaid expenses are based on management’s estimates of the work performed under service agreements, milestones achieved and experience with similar contracts. The Company monitors each of these factors and adjusts estimates accordingly.

Selling, General and Administrative
Costs incurred in connection with selling, general and administrative activities are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation, consulting and professional fees, marketing and advertising costs, medical affairs and regulatory costs associated with our commercial products, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. Marketing and advertising costs include marketing literature, promotional activities, conferences and seminars, branding and sponsorships.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred advertising costs of $
83.3
 million, $
86.5
 million, and $
56.5
 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position, as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstanc
es. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any significant uncertain tax positions

Share-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation program allows for grants of stock options and restricted stock units.
The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the option and restricted stock units and recognizes the expense related to awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option, which is typically the vesting period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

The Company estimates the fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that considers the fair value of its common stock, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the expected volatility of its common stock, expected dividends on its common stock, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The Company uses the simplified method described in the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to determine the expected life of the option grants. The estimate of expected volatility is based on the Company's historical volatility over a period commensurate with the option's expected term. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, it uses an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation for a period commensurate with the option's expected term.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding its cash and the issuers of its cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with highly-rated, federally-insured financial institutions. At times, such amounts may exceed federally-insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits since inception, and management believes that minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions.

Billings to large specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors account for the majority of the Company’s accounts receivables, an
d collateral is generally not required from these customers. To mitigate credit risk, the Company monitors the financial performance and credit-worthiness of its customers. See Note 3, Product Revenues, Accounts Receivable, and Reserves for Product Sales for additional information.
Net Loss per Share
Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. The issuance of common stock in connection with the pre-funded warrants are included in weighted-average shares outstanding and therefore, are included in the calculation of basic net loss per common share. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, convertible notes, common stock options and restricted stock are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for all periods presented.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements issued not yet adopted
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income.
 This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The requirements should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This standard is an amendment to the accounting guidance on income taxes which requires entities to provide additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disaggregated disclosures about income taxes paid. This guidance requires public entities to disclose in their rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes and to provide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our disclosures.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on segment reporting. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The amendment also requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting guidance on segment reporting
 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 17 Segment Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

6. Development Liability
In 2019, the Co
mpany entered into a development funding agreement (as amended, the “SFJ agreement”) with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group (“SFJ”), under which SFJ agreed to provide funding to the Company to support the development of pegcetacoplan for the treatment of patients with PNH. Under the SFJ agreement, SFJ paid the Company an aggregate of $
140.0
 million between June 2019 and January 2020.

Under the SFJ agreement, the Company granted a security interest to SFJ in all of its assets, excluding intellectual property and license agreements to which it is a party. In connection with the grant of the security interest, the Company agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt or enter into licensing transactions with respect to its intellectual property, other than specified types of licenses.
Following regul
atory approval for the use of systemic pegcetacoplan as a treatment for PNH by the FDA in May 2021 and by the European Medicines Agency in December 2021, the Company became obligated to pay SFJ an aggregate of $
460.0
 million in payments over the period from the time of each regulatory approval until the sixth anniversary of each regulatory approval. The Company paid SFJ a total of $
94.0
 million through March 31, 2024.
From December 15, 2021 to the final annual payment due in December 2027, the development liability was accreted from its initial carrying amount to the total payment amount using the effective interest rate method over the remaining life of the SFJ agreement. The difference between the carrying amount and the total payment amount is presented as a discount to the development liability. The accretion is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
In May 2024, the Compa
ny paid its remaining obligations under the SFJ agreement in full with $
326.5
 million of proceeds from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement (as defined below) (see Note 8). Upon such payment, SFJ released its security interest in the Company’s assets at that time. The Company concluded that the development liability was extinguished as of the payoff date, and the difference of $
1.9
 million between the reacquisition price of $
326.5
 million and the net carrying value of the development liability of $
324.6
 million was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of the development liability in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the period ended December 31, 2024.

8. Long-term Debt
Convertible Senior Notes
On September 16, 2019, the Company completed a private offering of the 2019 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $
220.0
 million issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes were approximately $
212.9
 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of $
6.6
 million and offering expenses of $
0.5
 million paid by the Company. The Company used $
28.4
 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below.
 On May 12,

2020, the Company issued the 2020 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $
300.0
 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes were approximately $
322.9
 million after deducting the purchasers’ discounts and commission of $
5.7
 million and offering expenses of $
0.3
 million. The Company used $
43.1
 million of the net proceeds from the sale to pay the cost of the additional capped call transactions in May 2020 described below.
The 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes are referred to together as the Convertible Notes. 
The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 
3.5
% per year payable 
semiannually
 in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020.
 The Convertible Notes will mature on 
September 15, 2026
, unless converted earlier, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.
The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion rate of 
25.3405
 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
39.4625
 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company deliver a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or a notice of redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances as provided in the Indenture.
Prior to March 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events:

•
during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;
•
during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
•
if the Company calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
•
upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the Indenture.
The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of December 31, 2024.
 On or after March 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election.
After 
September 20, 2023
, the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption, during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company calls any Convertible Notes for redemption, it will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with respect to such Convertible Notes, in which case the conversion r
ate applicable to the conversion of such Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be

126

Table of Contents

increased in certain circumstances. The Company has not called for redemption or redeemed any of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024.
If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change,” as defined in the Indenture, prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions, 
holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

In January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements to modify the conversion terms with certain holders of its 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes. Under the terms of these exchange agreements, in January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the holders exchanged approximately $
126.1
 million of 2019 Convertible Notes, $
201.1
 million of 2019 Convertible Notes, and $
98.1
 million of 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, in aggregate principal amount held by them for an aggregate of 
3,906,869
 shares, 
5,992,217
 shares and 
3,027,018
 shares, respectively, of common stock issued by the Company. The Company accounted for the exchange as an induced conversion based on the short period of time the conversion offer was open and the substantive conversion feature offer, which resulted in the expensing of the fair value of the shares that were issued in excess of the original terms of the Convertible Notes.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held in treasury Convertible Notes in principal amo
unt of $
425.4
 million w
hich have not been cancelled.

Capped Call Transactions
On 
September 11, 2019 and May 6, 2020, concurrently with the pricings of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with 
two
 counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which is initially $
39.4625
 (the conversion price of the Convertible Notes) and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of such Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, which is initially $
63.14
 per share, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.
On February 27, 2024, the Company unwound a portion of the capped call transactions with the capped call counterparties, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of $
98.8
 million. The unwind transactions were settled at a volume-weighted average price per share of $
64.11
 on March 8, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company holds remaining capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to $
93.9
 million principal amount of Convertible Notes.
Financing Agreement and Credit Facility

127

Table of Contents

On May 13, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a financing agreement (the “Sixth Street Financing Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), and Sixth Street Lending Partners (“Sixth Street”), as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders.

The Sixth Street Financing Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $
475.0
 million (the “Credit Facility”), consisting of an initial draw of $
375.0
 million at closing and a potential additional $
100.0
 million draw at the Company’s option upon satisfaction of a $
50.0
 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that the Company’s trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least $
180.0
 million prior to the $
100.0
 million draw. The Company can exercise the option for the $
100.0
 million draw through September 30, 2025, assuming such requirements are met.
The Credit Facility matures on 
May 13, 2030
 (the “Maturity Date”) and bears interest at (i) in the case of SOFR Loans, an annual rate equal to 3-month Term SOFR (subject to 
1.00
% floor), plus 
5.75
%, and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans, an annual rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement (subject to 
2.00
% floor), plus 
4.75
%. Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility.
The net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility were approximately $
358.2
 million, net of $
16.8
 million of issuance costs. The Company used $
326.5
 million of the proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility to buy out its remaining obligations to SFJ. The buyout of the SFJ development liability eliminated $
366.0
 million in payments to SFJ between 2024 and 2027, including approximately $
200.0
 million payable through 2025 (See Note 6).

The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. The Company will have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. The Company is required to repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are subject to a prepayment premium. Repayments may be made after the first year of the loan and are subject to a prepayment premium up to 
3
% depending on timing.

All obligations under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in substantially all assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company, including its intellectual property, and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company, including foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
The Sixth Street Financing Agreement contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, a financial covenant to maintain liquidity of at least $
50.0
 million if the Company’s market capitalization is below $3.0 billion, and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict indebtedness, liens, investments (including acquisitions), fundamental changes, asset sales and licensing transactions, dividends, modifications to material agreements, payment of subordinated indebtedness, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Among other permissions, the Company is permitted, on terms and conditions set forth on the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to $
100.0
 million, which amount is increased to $
200.0
 million upon certain sales or market capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of $
400.0
 million and 
10
% of the Company’s market capitalization, but not to exceed $
600.0
 million. The Company is subject to restrictions on sales and licensing transactions with respect to its core intellectual property, defined to include SYFOVRE, EMPAVELI, and other pegcetacoplan product assets, subject to certain exceptions, including certain transactions related to areas outside the United States and Europe.

11. License and Collaboration Agreements

Sobi License and Collaboration Agreement

In October 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries, Apellis Switzerland GmbH and APL DEL Holdings, LLC, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Sobi collaboration agreement”) with Sobi, concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other structurally and functionally similar compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmological administration (collectively referred to as the “Licensed Products”).

Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, the Company granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights of the Company), sublicensable license of certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in all countries outside of the United States.

The Company retains the right to commercialize Licensed Products in the United States, and, subject to specified limitations, to develop Licensed Products worldwide for commercialization in the United States.

Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, the Company and Sobi agreed to collaborate to develop Licensed Products for certain indications, including PNH, C3G, IC-MPGN and HSCT-TMA (collectively the “Initial Indications”), and any other indications subsequently agreed upon by the parties, for commercialization by or on behalf of the Company in the United States and by or on behalf of Sobi outside of the United States. If the parties do not agree to jointly pursue any development activities for the Licensed Products (whether for an Initial Indication or otherwise), the party proposing to pursue such activities may conduct such activities at its sole expense (with the non-proposing party having the right to obtain rights to the data generated by such development activities by paying a specified percentage of that expense), subject to agreed-upon exceptions that limit each party’s unilateral development rights.

The initial development plan sets forth the initial development activities to be conducted by each of the Company and Sobi, with the Company bearing all costs incurred in conducting the activities set forth in such initial development plan, as well as certain specified additional costs that are not included in the initial development plan that may be incurred by the parties in developing Licensed Products for PNH in the European Union and the United Kingdom. The Company and Sobi formed several governance committees to oversee the development and manufacture, and to review and discuss the commercialization, of Licensed Products.

The Company shall supply 
Licensed 
Products to Sobi for development and for commercialization outside of the United States in accordance with a supply agreement. The Sobi collaboration agreement grants Sobi the right to perform or have performed drug product manufacturing of Licensed Products for development and for commercialization outside the United States and to manufacture or have manufactured drug substance under certain circumstances. For the period ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company

revenue of $
53.0
 million and $
15.3
 million, respectively, for the supply of Licensed Products to Sobi, 
which is included in License and other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income.

Sobi paid the Company an upfront payment of $
250.0
 million in November 2020 and agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $
915.0
 million upon the achieve
ment of specified one-time regulatory and commercial milestone events, of which the Company received $
50.0
 million in April 2022 for the achievement of a regulatory development milestone in Europe. Sobi also agreed to reimburse the Company for up to $
80.0
 million in development costs, of which the Company received a total of $
65.0
 million through January 2023 and waived the remaining payment of $
15.0
 million in January, 2024. The Company will also be entitled to receive tiered, double-digit royalties (ranging from high teens to high twenties) on sales of Licensed Products outside of the United States, subject to customary deductions and third-party payment obligations, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; and (iii) ten (
10
) years after the first commercial sale of the applicable Licensed Product, in each case on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis. Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, the Company remains responsible for its license fee obligations (including royalty obligations) to the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”), as a licensor of the Company.

Under the Sobi colla
boration agreement, as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
18.4
 million, $
10.0
 million and $
3.0

80.0
 million reimbursement commitment from Sobi. Since contract inception, the Company has recognized $
65.0
 million in contra-research and development expenses and waived the remaining $
15.0
 million in connection with the decision to discontinue the CAD program.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $
15.0
 million in other current assets, which represented the receivable for contra-research and development expens
es incurred but not yet reimbursed from Sobi. In January 2024, the Company waived the remaining reimbursement payment of $
15.0
 million in connection with the decision to discontinue the CAD program.

University of Pennsylvania License Agreement

The

3.2
 million based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $
5.0
 million based upon the achievement of specified annual sales milestones with respect to each licensed product, and to pay low single-digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product, subject to a step-down upon patent expiry, with minimum quarterly royalty thresholds.

 licensed products. The license agreement also requires the Company to pay low single digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product, subject to a step-down upon patent expiry, with minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a specified portion of income it receives from sublicensees.

In January 2021, the Company paid $
25.0
 million for a sublicense fee owed to Penn related to the Sobi collaboration agreement and another licensing transaction. In August 2021, the Company paid $

Beam Research Collaboration

In June 2021, the Company entered into an exclusive 
five-year
 research collaboration (the “Beam collaboration agreement”) with Beam Therapeutics, Inc. (
“Beam”) focused on the use of Beam’s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases. The Company and Beam agreed to collaborate on up to 
six
 research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver and brain. Under the terms of the Beam collaboration agreement, the Company is responsible for selecting specific genes within the complement system in various organs including the eye, liver and brain (the “Target List”) and providing analytical support while Beam will apply its base editing technology and conduct preclinical research on up to six base editing programs for the Target List. During the first five years of the Beam collaboration agreement, Beam is prohibited from developing on its own or with a third party any base editing therapies associated with the items on the Target List but does not prevent Beam from licensing its intellectual property to a third-party for another purpose outside of the Target List. The Company will have exclusive rights to license each of the six programs and will assume responsibility for subsequent development and commercialization. Beam may elect to enter a 50-50 co-development and U.S. co-commercialization agreement with the Company with respect to any one program licensed under the Beam collaboration agreement and upon such election any license agreement in place at that time, would be terminated.

As part of the Beam collaboration agreement, the Company agreed to pay a $
50.0
 million up-front, non-refundable payment to Beam, which the Company 
paid in July 2021. The Company paid an additional $
25.0
 million on the first anniversary of the Beam collaboration agreement in June 2022. The Company and Beam are each responsible for their own costs during the research collaboration. If and after the opt-in license rights are exercised for each of the up to six programs, Beam will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and sales milestones from the Company, as well as royalty payments on sales. The Beam collaboration agreement has an initial term of five years and may be extended up to 
two years
 on a per year program-by-program basis.

The Company analyzed the Beam collaboration agreement pursuant to ASC 808 to assess whether the agreement involved joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. Since each party is actively participating in this activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards related to the activity through each party’s costs will be accounted for under ASC 808.
Since ASC 808 does not provide recognition guidance, the Company referred to the guidance under FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development (“ASC
 730”), to arrangements involving payments by the Company. ASC 730 requires the Company to recognize research and developments costs as expense as incurred since the payment was made for the use of Beam’s intellectual property and research and development services and there is no alternative use.

12. Employee Retirement Plans
The Company adopted an employee profit-sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”), 
qualified
 under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). All of the Company’s full-time employees who have attained the age of 
21
 are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan immediately upon employment. Pursuant to the 401(k) Plan, employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit and have the amount of the reduction contributed to the 401(k) Plan. In 
2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company recorded $
5.1
 million, $
5.7
 million, and $
4.3
 million respectively, for employer contributions made to the 401(k) Plan.
The Company maintains a pension plan covering employees of its Swiss subsidiary, Apellis International GmbH (f/k/a Apellis Switzerland GmbH) (the “Swiss Plan”). The Swiss Plan is a government-mandated retirement fund that provides employees with a minimum benefit. Employer and employee contributions are made to the Swiss Plan based on various percentages of salary and wages that vary according to employee age and other factors. As is customary with Swiss pension plans, the assets of the Swiss Plan are invested in a collective fund, which are held and invested by a Swiss insurance company. The investment strategy of the Swiss Plan is managed by an independent asset manager with the objective of achieving a consistent long-term return which will provide sufficient funding for future pension obligations while limiting risk.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Swiss Plan was underfunded by $
1.6
 million as the fair value of the plan assets of $
16.7
 million was less than the projected benefit obligation of $
18.3
 million. The accumulated benefit obligation at 
December 31, 2024
 was $
0.6
 million. The Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
 was $
1.2
 million. The contributions to the Swiss Plan for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 were not material.

Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of its net federal, foreign and state deferred tax assets, and as a result, a valuation allowance of $
723.6
 million and $
753.4
 million has been established at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the valuation allowance of $
29.8
 million was primar
ily driven by the utilization of federal and foreign net operating losses and pay-down of the development liability with SFJ.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development (R&D) expenditures under IRC Section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. This rule became effective for the Company on January 1, 2022 and resulted in the capitalization of R&D costs of approximately $
42.4
 million and $
42.3
 million for tax year ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company will amortize these costs for tax purposes over 
5
 years if the R&D was performed in the U.S. and over 
15
 year
s if the R&D was performed outside the U.S.
On December 31, 2024, 
the Company had approximately $
422.5
 million, $
621.8
 million and $
1,515.7
 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforward, respectively. On December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $
494.1
 million, $
524.0
 million and $
1,663.3
 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforward, respectively. The Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $
107.8
 million and $
26.4
 million, respectively of as of December 31, 2024. Federal net operating loss carryforward in the amount of $
420.9
 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining federal and state net operating loss, research and development tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 
2025
. The Company’s foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 
2027
.
Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), the net operating loss (“NOL”), and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a 
three-year
 period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. The Company may have experienced such ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future, as a result of shifts in its stock ownership, some of which are outside the Company’s control. Such ownership changes could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future tax liability.

14. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has certain non-cancelable purchase obligations related to the manufacturing of drug substance. The Company has agreed to purchase from Bachem Americas, Inc. a significant portion of its requirements for the pegcetacoplan drug substance. Under a commercial supply agreement with NOF Corporation ("NOF"), the Company has agreed to purchase activated polyethylene glycol derivative, or PEG, which is a component of pegcetacoplan. In September 2024, the Company terminated the minimum purchase obligation with NOF for 2025. Under these agreements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company is obligated to pay up to an aggrega
te of $
45.7
 million to these vendors. As a result of this termination, the Company incurred an expense of $
6.4
 million, which is included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As the amount is not due until January 2026, it is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
In addition, the Company has other non-cancelable purchase agreements as of December 31, 2024, under which it is obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $

36
 months from the date of delivery. If the Company were unable to take delivery of a previously ordered vehicle, the Company may incur nominal fees.
Indemnifications
—In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third-party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has 
no
t incurred any cost to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions.

Legal—
During the normal course of business, the Company may be a party to legal claims that may not be covered by insurance.

On August 2, 2023, Judith M. Soderberg filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the Company (the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting and/or omitting certain material facts related to the design of SYFOVRE’s clinical trials and the risks associated with SYFOVRE’s commercial adoption. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, compensatory damages and equitable relief in favor of the alleged class against all defendants, including interest, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by plaintiffs, including attorneys’ and expert fees.

On October 2, 2023, the defendants moved to transfer the action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

On October 23, 2023, the Court appointed Ray Peleckas and Michigan Laborers’ Pension Fund together as Co-Lead Plaintiffs and assigned the action the caption In Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case 1:23-cv-00834-MN. The Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 8, 2024 (the “Amended Complaint”). The Amended Complaint is brought on behalf of a class of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Apellis common stock between January 28, 2021 and July 28, 2023, inclusive, names the Company and Cedric Francois, our chief executive officer, as defendants, and makes similar allegations, asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the Complaint. On May 17, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware approved the motion to transfer to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint on June 12, 2024, and the Court held oral argument on this motion for November 14, 2024. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion to dismiss.

On December 19, 2024, purported stockholder Patrick Campbell, and on December 30, 2024, purported stockholder Kenneth Olson filed putative stockholder derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of the Company against the Company’s directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste, and alleged violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act related to the design of SYFOVRE’s clinical trials and the risks associated with SYFOVRE’s commercial adoption. The complaints seek monetary and punitive damages, and costs, including attorneys’ fees. On January 21, 2025, the cases were consolidated under the caption 
In re Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Derivative Litigation
, No. 1:24-cv-13128-JEK. By the same order, the Court stayed the stockholder derivative litigation pending the Court’s ruling on the defendants’ motion to dismiss in the securities class action.
The Company’s businesses may also be subject at any time to other commercial disputes, product liability claims, personal injury claims, third-party subpoenas or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property infringement, employment or investor matters, and the Company expects that this will continue to be the case in the future.
For example, in August 2024, an individual filed a civil action against the Company in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging personal injury claims in connection with the use of SYFOVRE. We moved to dismiss this civil action in September 2024. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion to dismiss, as of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The outcome of the matters described above cannot be predicted with certainty and therefore any loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. However, the Company intends to vigorously defend against these matters.

15. Equity Incentive Plans

Share-based Compensation
The Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, an equity incentive plan in 2010 (as amended, the “2010 Plan”). The Board of Directors and stockholders amended the 2010 Plan in August 2017 to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder to 
6,188,466
. The 2010 Plan allowed for the grant of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to purchase common stock for employees, directors and consultants under terms and conditions established by the Board of Directors. Incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options were granted at exercise prices that were no less than 
100
% of the estimated fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. If an individual owns capital stock representing more than 
10
% of the voting shares, the price of each share was at least 
110
% of the fair value on the date of grant. The Board of Directors determined the fair value of common stock with the assistance of a third-party specialist. Options expire 
10
 years from the issuance date. Following the adoption of the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company no longer grants stock options or other awards under the 2010 Plan.
In October 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”), which became effective on November 8, 2017. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2017 plan is the sum of (i) 
1,359,587
 shares of common stock, plus (ii) an additional number of shares of common stock equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 equity incentive plan that remained available for future issuance immediately prior to the effectiveness of the 2017 Plan, which was 
299,568
 shares, and (b) the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the 2010 equity incentive plan upon effectiveness of the 2017 plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by us at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right plus (iii) an annual increase, to be added the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 and continuing until, and including, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027, 
equal to the lowest of 
4,219,409
 shares of common stock, 
4.0
% of the n
umber of shares of common stock outstanding on the first day of the fiscal year and an amount determined by the board of directors. 
On January 1, 2024, the shares available for future issuance under the 2017 plan were increased by 
4,219,409
 shares pursuant to the annual increase described above. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
9,726,725
 shares available for future grants under the 2017 Plan. In January 2025, the shares available for future issuance under the 2017 plan were increased by an additional 
4,219,409
 shares.
Additionally, since 2019, the Company has granted equity awards as equity inducement awards material to entry into employment with the Company to certain newly hired employees outside of the Company’s existing plans in accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5635(c)(4). In February 2020, the Board of Directors adopted the 2020 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), which permitted the Company to grant equity awards to newly hired employees in accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5635(c)(4). The aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan was initially 
750,000
 shares. The Board of Directors amended the 2020 Plan to add 
200,000
 shares on January 1, 2024, which increased the total number of shares reserved for issuance to 
1,950,000
 shares as of January 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
528,595
 shares available for future grants under the 2020 Plan. 
No
 additional shares have been reserved under the 2020 Plan in 2025.

In October 2017, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective upon the IPO and provides participating employees with the opportunity to purchase up to an aggregate of 
468,823
 shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2017 ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 and continuing until, and including, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027, equal to the lowest of (i) 
937,646
 shares of common stock, (ii) 
1.0
% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the first day of the fiscal year and (iii) an amount determined by the board of directors. The board of directors initiated the first offering under ESPP in October 2019. On December 31, 2024,

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Table of Contents

As required by Rule 13a‑15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded no such changes during the year ended December 31, 2024 materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
