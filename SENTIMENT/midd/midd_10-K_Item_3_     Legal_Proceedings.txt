(1)  On November 7, 2017, the company's Board of Directors resolved to terminate the company's existing share repurchase program, effective as of such date, which was originally adopted in 1998, and approved a new stock repurchase program.  This program authorizes the company to repurchase in the aggregate up to 2,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In May 2022 and July 2024, the company's Board of Directors approved the company to repurchase an additional 2,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock under the current program. As of December 28, 2024, the total number of shares authorized for repurchase under the program is 7,500,000. As of December 28, 2024, 3,233,890 shares had been purchased under the stock repurchase program and 4,266,110 shares remained authorized for repurchase.  
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company also treats shares withheld for tax purposes on behalf of employees in connection with the vesting of restricted share grants as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under the authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.
