The Customers and Market

Commercial Foodservice Equipment Industry

The company's end-user customers include: (i) fast food, fast casual and quick-service restaurants, including ghost kitchens, (ii) full-service restaurants, including casual-theme restaurants, (iii) retail outlets, such as convenience stores, supermarkets and department stores and (iv) public and private institutions, such as hotels, resorts, schools, hospitals, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, stadiums, airports, corporate cafeterias, college and universities, military facilities and government agencies. The company's domestic sales are primarily through independent dealers and distributors and are marketed by the company's sales personnel and network of independent manufacturers' representatives. Many of the dealers in the U.S. belong to buying groups that negotiate sales terms with the company. Certain large multi-national restaurant and hotel chain customers have purchasing organizations that manage product procurement for their systems. Included in these customers are several large multi-national restaurant chains, which account for a meaningful portion of the company's business, although no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.

The commercial foodservice equipment industry growth opportunities in the United States are driven by the development of new quick-service and casual-theme restaurant chain concepts, the expansion of foodservice into nontraditional locations such as convenience stores and retail outlets, as well as store equipment modernization driven by efforts to improve efficiencies within foodservice operations. In the international markets, foodservice equipment manufacturers leverage growth opportunities within emerging international economies and as U.S. chains expand into developing regions.

The company believes that the worldwide commercial foodservice equipment market has sales in excess of $35.0 billion. The company believes that continuing growth in demand for foodservice equipment will result from the development of new restaurant concepts in the U.S. and the expansion of U.S. and foreign chains into international markets, the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment and new equipment requirements resulting from menu changes, menu diversity, labor reallocation and consumer food trends.
The company is developing innovations to solve the challenges within our customers' operations. We believe automated equipment that addresses labor issues will provide our customers a meaningful return on their investment. Innovative equipment solutions, including integrated IoT platforms and universal controllers, will allow restaurateurs to scale their operations quickly and leverage data to make operational decisions. 

Food Processing Equipment Industry

The company's customers include a diversified base of leading food processors. Customers include several large international food processing companies, which account for a significant portion of the revenues of this business segment, although none of which is greater than 10% of net sales. A large portion of the company's revenues have been generated from producers of protein products such as bacon, salami, hot dogs, dinner sausages, poultry, lunchmeats, sous vide prepared meals and plant based/alternative protein and producers of bakery products, such as cakes, muffins, cookies, crackers, pies, bread and buns; however, the company believes that it can leverage its expertise and product development capabilities in thermal processing to organically grow into new end markets and offers unique, automated full processing line solutions.

Food processing historically was highly fragmented; however, it has quickly become a highly competitive landscape with the emergence of large conglomerates that possess a variety of food brands. The consolidation of food processing plants associated with industry consolidation drives a need for more flexible and efficient equipment that is capable of processing large volumes of consistent quality products in quicker cycle times. In recent years, food processors have had to conform to the demands of “big box” retailers and the restaurant industry, including, most importantly, greater product consistency and exact package weights. Food processors are beginning to realize that their old equipment is no longer capable of efficiently producing adequate uniformity in the large product volumes required, and they are turning to equipment manufacturers that offer better process control for proven product consistency, innovative packaging designs and other solutions. To protect their own brands and reputations, retailers and large restaurant chains are also dictating food safety standards that are often stricter than government regulations.
A number of factors, including raw material prices, cost of ownership of their equipment, labor and health care costs, are driving food processors to focus on ways to improve their generally thin profitability margins. In order to increase the profitability and efficiency in processing plants, food processors pay increasingly more attention to the performance of their machinery and the flexibility in the functionality of the equipment. Food processors are continuously looking for ways to make their plants safer and reduce labor-intensive activities. Food processors have begun to recognize the value of new technology as an important vehicle to drive productivity and profitability in their plants. Due to customer requirements, food processors are expected to continue to demand new and innovative equipment that addresses food safety, food quality, automation, flexibility and sustainability.
Improving living standards in developing countries is spurring increased worldwide demand for pre-cooked and convenience food products. As industrializing countries create more jobs, consumers in these countries will have the means to buy pre-cooked food products. In industrialized regions, such as Western Europe and the U.S., consumers are demanding more pre-cooked and convenience food products, such as deli tray variety packs, frozen food products and ready-to-eat varieties of ethnic foods.

The global food processing equipment industry is large and growing. The company estimates demand for food processing equipment is in excess of $50.0 billion worldwide.

Residential Kitchen Equipment Industry
The company’s end-users include customers with high-end residential kitchens as well as retail dealers of residential cooking equipment. The market potential for such equipment has continued to broaden due to an increase in interest from the consumer to have professionally styled appliances with commercial inspired, higher performing features in their home as well as their outdoor entertaining space. The kitchen, both indoors and out, has been the main area in which consumers have invested the most money over the past several decades to increase the personal satisfaction and the value of their home. Other important factors which affect the market size and growth include the level of new home starts, increase in home renovations and general macro-economic factors. Macro-economic factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence, which impact the overall economy, impact the residential kitchen equipment industry and cause variability in the revenues at this segment. The residential kitchen appliance industry is estimated to be in excess of $250.0 billion worldwide.

The company’s sale process is highly consultative due to the highly technical nature of the equipment, especially in the case of the full processing line solutions. During a typical sales process, salespeople make several visits to the customer’s facility to conceptually discuss the production requirements, footprint and configuration of the proposed equipment. The company employs a technically proficient sales force, many of whom have previous technical experience with the company as well as education backgrounds in food science. The sales strategy of the company is fostered by its own food technologists and with Protein and Bakery Innovation Centers in Chicago, Dallas and India, which are available for development with technical performance and product testing for customers.
Residential Kitchen Equipment Group
The company’s products are marketed through a network of distributors, dealers, designers, select online retailers and home builders to the residential customers. The company markets and sells its products to these channels through a company-employed sales force. The company’s products are distributed through a combination of an independent network of distributors and its wholly owned distribution operations. The company's wholly owned distribution operations include two primary customer support centers and regional logistic warehouse operations, which stock products and service parts for the respective region. To supplement the sales and distribution network, the company has invested in Middleby branded residential showrooms in Chicago, Orange County, California and Dallas.
Marketing support is provided to and coordinated with its network of dealers, designers, and home builders' sales partners to allow for coordinated efforts to market jointly to the end-user customers. The company in certain cases offers incentive based financial programs to invest in local marketing activities with these sales partners.
