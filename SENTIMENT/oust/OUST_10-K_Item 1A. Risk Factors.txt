Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.
Our company has a limited operating history, having been in operation since 2015. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future prospects. Certain factors that could alone or in combination prevent us from successfully commercializing our products include:
•
recession or economic downturn globally or in the jurisdictions in which we do business;
•
inflation or deflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation or deflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business;
•
our reliance on third parties to manufacture our products or supply significant parts needed for our production process;
•
our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers;
•
our ability to tailor our commercial production depending on scale and on a cost-effective basis in a timely manner;
•
our ability to successfully expand our product offerings;
•
our ability to develop and protect intellectual property;
•
our ability to gain market acceptance of our products with customers and maintain and expand customer relationships; 
•
the adaptability of our products and the ability of our customers to integrate our products into their products in a timely and effective manner; 
•
the actions of direct and indirect competitors that may seek to enter the markets in which we expect to compete or that may seek to impose barriers to one or more markets that we intend to target;     
•
the long-lead time for development of market opportunities, for which we are only at an early stage of development; 
•
our ability to forecast our revenue, budget, and manage our expenses; 
•
difficulty in collecting, or failure to collect, accounts receivable, as well as longer collection periods;
•
our ability to comply with existing and new or modified local laws and regulations applicable to our business, or laws and regulations applicable to our customers for applications in which they may use our products;
•
our ability to plan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future products, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to these current and future products; 
•
our ability to anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate; 
•
our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;
•
our ability to effectively manage our growth and business operations; and
•
our ability to recruit and retain talented people at all levels of our organization.
If we fail to understand fully or adequately address the challenges that we are currently encountering or that we may encounter in the future, including those challenges described here and elsewhere in this Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected. If the risks and uncertainties that we plan for when operating our business are incorrect or change, or if we fail to manage these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have incurred significant losses to date and may never achieve or sustain profitability.
We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception. In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of $97.0 million and $374.1 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our product offering and continue to scale our commercial operations and research and development program. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.1 million. Even if we are able to increase the sales of our products, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable.
We expect we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we:
•
hire additional personnel, as needed, to support investments in research and development (“R&D”), in order to develop technology and related software and to support the compliance needs in connection with being a public company;
•
increase our sales and marketing functions, including expansion of our customer support and distribution capabilities; and
•
expand operations and manufacturing.
If our products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, we will not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our business we may be unable to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.
We expect to incur substantial R&D costs and devote significant resources to developing and commercializing new products, which could significantly affect our ability to become profitable and may not result in revenue to us. Any delay or interruption of the development and commercialization of new products may adversely affect our existing business and prospects for securing future business.
Our future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and customer requirements, and introducing new and effective products at an opportune time that may then achieve market acceptance. To remain competitive, we continue to develop new products and expand our existing product offerings. For instance, in January 2023, we announced the release of our software, Ouster Gemini, a cloud-backed digital lidar perception platform for crowd analytics, security, and intelligent transportation systems. Ouster Gemini offers the ability to detect, classify, and track moving objects in real-time using the 3D data from a single or multiple fused Ouster lidar sensors. In connection with the development of our products, we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial R&D costs, which may increase over time. Our R&D expenses were $58.1 million and $91.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Because we account for R&D as an operating expense, these expenditures will adversely affect our results of operations in the future.
Further, our R&D program may be delayed and may not produce timely results. If we cannot produce successful results in time to accommodate customers’ or potential customers’ development timelines, we may lose business. If we are unsuccessful in introducing these products in accordance with our product launch plans or any publicly announced launch dates, it may be injurious to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our ability to be competitive in our four target markets and potential new markets. In launching such products, we may face foreseen and unforeseen difficulties that adversely affect such commercialization and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business. Additionally, the success of our competitors’ R&D efforts, including producing higher performing products or providing products competitive to our new products to our customers before us, may result in loss of business to us.
The promise of new products and successful R&D may even decrease our expected and actual revenue attributable to existing products, as historically, customers have delayed or cancelled outstanding purchasing commitments for certain products in anticipation of the release of new generation products from the Company. There is no guarantee that these delays and cancellations will not occur again in the future as we develop, announce and commercialize new products like our DF solid-state lidar sensor or our complementary software solutions.
If we are unable to overcome our limited sales history and establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among customers in our target markets or if our revenue opportunity does not materialize into sales and revenue, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially.
Our company has a limited sales history, as we only commenced selling our first revenue grade products in late 2018. Because of our limited sales history, we have limited experience managing and growing our relationships with existing customers and securing new customers in our target industries.
Our relationships with many of our existing customers are limited as they may not be prepared to select Ouster as a long-term supplier given our limited operating and sales history. To establish preliminary relationships with certain customers and to build their confidence, we have entered, and may continue to enter, into evaluation agreements, spot buy purchase 
15

ontents
orders, non-binding letters of intent, and strategic customer agreements. These agreements are largely non-binding, do not include any minimum obligation to purchase any quantities of any products at this time, and do not require that the parties enter into a subsequent definitive, long-term, binding agreements; however, these preliminary agreements assist the Company in building confidence with customers if we are able to effectively perform and otherwise maintain positive relationships with them. If we are unable to build confidence with our existing customers, either through these preliminary agreements (due to any failure to enter into or perform under the agreements) or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure opportunities from these non-binding agreements, including those involving strategic customers,

we may be unable to produce accurate forecasts or become profitable.
Our new customers may be less confident in us and less likely to purchase our products because of a lack of awareness about our products. They may also not be convinced that our business will succeed because of the absence of an established sales, service, support, and operating history. To address this, we must, among other activities, grow and improve our marketing capability and brand awareness, which may be costly. These activities may not be effective or could delay our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe are suitable to our technology and products and may prevent us from successfully commercializing our products.
To build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence in our products, long-term financial viability and business prospects. Failure to establish and maintain customer confidence may also adversely affect our reputation and business among our suppliers, analysts, ratings agencies, stockholders and other interested parties.
Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide and could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.
Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•
the timing of ultimate end market and customer adoption of our products and particular versions of our products;
•
the varying length of production cycles for our customers to integrate our products into their broader platforms;
•
supply chain constraints and considerations and impacts on our costs of goods sold, such as shortages of semiconductor chips;
•
our product mix and average selling prices, including negotiated selling prices and long-term customer agreements;
•
the cost of raw materials or supplied components critical for the manufacture of our products;
•
the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development relating to our digital lidar technology and related software;
•
developments involving our competitors;
•
changes in governmental regulations affecting us, our supply chain, or applications in which our customers use our products or software, including export controls, tariffs, data privacy and security, or new regulatory standards for automotive, industrial, infrastructure, or robotics;
•
future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;
•
adverse litigation, judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs, or claims that may give rise to such costs; and
•
general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
Many of these factors are outside of our control and may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business. The individual or cumulative effects of factors discussed above could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.
This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide is below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even if our performance is consistent with any previously publicly stated guidance.

Our revenue and margins could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain competitive average selling prices, high sales volumes, and/or fail to reduce product costs.
Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers often place increased downward pressure on our average selling prices. We also expect that any long term or high-volume agreements with customers may require step-downs in pricing over the term of the agreement or, if commercialized, over the period of production. We strive to keep our average selling price competitive and expect to achieve profitability by maintaining competitive average sales prices and through continually lower product costs. Our average selling price may be driven down by customer-specific selling price fluctuations such as non-standard discounts on large volume purchases. These lower average selling prices on large volume purchases may cause fluctuations in revenue and gross margins on a quarterly and annual basis and ultimately adversely affect our profitability. We have experienced and may in the future experience declines in the average selling prices of our products generally as our customers seek to commercialize autonomous systems at prices low enough to achieve market acceptance and as our competitors continue to produce and commercialize lower cost competing technologies. To achieve profitability and maintain margins, we will also need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs. Reductions in product and manufacturing costs are principally achieved by scaling our production volumes and through step changes in manufacturing and continued engineering of the most cost-effective designs for our products. Further, as we continue to provide support for REV6, we anticipate downward pressure on our margins. In addition, we must continuously drive initiatives to reduce labor cost, improve worker efficiency, reduce the cost of materials, further lower overall product costs by carefully managing component prices, inventory and shipping cost, and minimize the impacts of tariffs and other regulatory impacts. We need to continually increase sales volume and introduce new, lower-cost products in order to maintain our overall gross margin. If we are unable to maintain competitive average selling prices, increase our sales volume or successfully introduce new, low-cost products, our revenue and overall gross margin will likely decline.
We compete against established market participants that have substantially greater resources than us and against known and unknown market entrants who may disrupt our target markets.
Our target markets are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively in the market against these competitors. Competitors may offer lidar products at lower prices than ours, including pricing that we believe is below their cost, or may offer superior performing lidar products. These companies also compete with us indirectly by attempting to solve some of the same challenges with different technology. Established competitors in the market for lidar sensors have significantly greater resources and more experience than we do. These competitors have commercialized lidar technology that has achieved market adoption, strong brand recognition and may continue to improve in both anticipated and unanticipated ways. They may also have entered into commercial relationships with key customers and have built relationships and dependencies between themselves and those key customers.
In addition to current market competitors, new competitors may enter the lidar market or create products that function as an alternative to lidar, which may disrupt the commercial landscape of our target markets in ways that we may not be able to adapt to adequately or in a timely fashion.

The already competitive landscape of the lidar market, including both foreseeable and unforeseeable entries of competitors and lidar technology from those competitors in our target markets, along with the potential emergence of new non-lidar solutions, may result in downward pricing pressure, reduced margins and may impede our ability to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We target many customers that are large corporations with substantial negotiating power and exacting product standards. If we are unable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects and results of operations will be adversely affected.
Many of our current and potential customers are large corporations that often possess significant leverage over their suppliers, and can successfully demand contract terms favorable to themselves, such as reserving the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience. The disparities in negotiating power between us and larger corporations have required, and may require in the future, that we accept less favorable contract terms. These large corporations also have exacting technical specifications and requirements that we have been unable to, and may continue to be unable to, meet, thereby precluding our ability to secure sales. Meeting the technical requirements to secure and maintain significant contracts with any of these companies will require a substantial investment of our time and resources, and if we fail to comply with our customers’ technical specifications and standards, we may lose existing and future business. Even when we succeed in securing contracts, these large companies have required, and may require in the future, evolving technical specifications for our products and may terminate our agreement or make a later determination that our products are not satisfactory, and even set a standard for the industry that we may not be able to meet. We therefore have no assurance that we can establish relationships with these companies, that our products will meet the needs of these or other companies, or that a contract with these companies will culminate in significant or any product sales.

Furthermore, in some instances, these large companies may have internally developed products and solutions that are competitive to our products. These companies may have substantial research and development resources, which may allow them to acquire or develop independently, or in partnership with others, competitive technologies. Such activities may foreclose significant sales opportunities for our products.
If our products are not selected for inclusion in our target markets, our business will be materially and adversely affected.
Although our products are designed for use in multiple markets, each of our target or new markets may have unique features and demands. If we are unsuccessful in meeting this demand, it may affect our entrance into these target or new markets which could adversely affect our future results of operations.
Our products are used in a wide variety of existing and emerging use cases in the industrial market, where our target customers are generally engaged in the manufacturing, operation, or after-market modification of heavy industrial machinery. These customers tend to be large companies that move slowly to larger scale production, often with years-long timelines. If our products are not chosen for deployment in these projects, or we lose a program under any circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to obtain that business again for many years. Industrial automation is a demanding industry with product specifications that our products may not always meet.
Our products also are used in a wide variety of existing and emerging use cases in the smart infrastructure market, which generally consists of public bodies and private commercial businesses engaging in the monitoring and analysis of pedestrian and vehicle movements for the purpose of providing building security, improving road user safety, and increasing roadway efficiency. This is still a nascent market, and while this industry is experimenting with the use of lidar in these applications, our customers may decide that lidar is not a viable solution for a variety of reasons, including price points, interoperability, and integration of lidar sensors. Customers in this market are often local governments, such as city governments, which may be subject to political pressures, and may not control their own budgets. For example, programs could be cancelled due to executive or legislative action that is out of a local government’s control.
Our products also may be purchased by automotive OEMs and their suppliers in connection with their design and development of autonomous driving and ADAS technology. These programs are time and resource intensive, requiring thousands of man hours and several years. Automotive OEMs and suppliers undertake extensive testing or qualification processes prior to placing orders for large quantities of products such as ours, because such products will function as part of a larger system or platform and must meet other specifications. We spend significant time and resources to pursue the business of having our products selected by automotive OEMs and their suppliers for use in the manufacture of a particular vehicle model. If we are not chosen to supply products to Tiers 1s, OEMs may be less inclined to select our products for a particular vehicle model, which could turn into a lost opportunity to supply our products to this automotive OEM for a period of several years. If our products are not selected by an automotive OEM or its suppliers for one vehicle model or if our products are not successful in that vehicle model, it is less likely that our products will be deployed in other vehicle models of that OEM. If we fail to win a significant number of vehicle models from one or more of automotive OEMs or their suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Our products also are used in a wide variety of existing and emerging use cases in the robotics market, in which our customers are generally engaged in the design, production, operation, or after-market modification of small mobile unmanned vehicles, which includes wheeled robots, legged robots, and drones. This is a competitive market that often has strict functional and pricing requirements for products. If we are unable to make products that meet these requirements, or sell products at the required price point, we could lose this business to competitors or competitive technologies. There are diverse and potentially conflicting requirements across the robotics industry that may force us to prioritize certain segments over others, resulting in a lower total available market. Our target markets involve risks of program delay, loss, and cancellation.
The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from undetected defects, errors or reliability issues in hardware or software which could reduce the market adoption of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, expose us to product liability and other claims and adversely affect our operating costs.
Our products are highly technical and very complex and require high standards to manufacture and have in the past and will likely in the future experience defects, errors or reliability issues at various stages of development. We may be unable to timely release new products, manufacture existing products, correct problems that have arisen or correct such problems to our customers’ satisfaction. Additionally, undetected errors, defects or reliability issues, especially as new products are introduced or as new versions are released, could result in serious injury to the end users of technology incorporating our products, or those in the surrounding area, our customers never being able to commercialize technology incorporating our products, litigation against us, negative publicity and other consequences. These risks are particularly prevalent in the 
18
Table of C
ontents
autonomous driving and ADAS markets. Some errors or defects in our products may only be discovered after they have been tested, commercialized and deployed by customers. If that is the case, we may incur significant additional development costs and product recall expenses, repair and/or replacement costs. These problems may also result in claims, including class actions, against us by our customers or others. Our reputation or brand may be damaged as a result of these problems and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and could adversely affect our financial results.
In addition, we could face material legal claims for breach of contract, product liability, fraud, tort or breach of warranty as a result of these problems. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our products. In addition, our business liability insurance coverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all. These product-related issues could result in claims against us and our business could be adversely affected.
Our customers use our solutions in autonomous driving and ADAS applications, which present the risk of significant injury, including fatalities. We may be subject to claims if a product using our lidar technology is involved in an accident and persons are injured or purport to be injured. Any insurance that we carry may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. Similarly, our customers could be subjected to claims as a result of such accidents and bring legal claims against us to attempt to hold us liable. In addition, if lawmakers or governmental agencies were to determine that the use of our products or autonomous driving or certain ADAS applications increased the risk of injury to all or a subset of our customers, they may pass laws or adopt regulations that limit the use of our products or increase our liability associated with the use of our products or that regulate the use of or delay the deployment of autonomous driving and ADAS technology. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, relationships with customers, operating results or financial condition.
We may incur significant direct or indirect liabilities in connection with our product warranties which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
We typically offer a limited product warranty that requires our products to conform to the applicable specifications and be free from defects in materials and workmanship for one to two years. As a result of increased competition and changing standards in our target markets, we may be required to increase our warranty period length and the scope of our warranty. To be competitive, we may be required to implement these increases before we are able to determine the economic impact of an increase. Accordingly, we may be at risk that any such warranty increase could result in foreseeable and unforeseeable losses for the Company.
In particular, the usage of our products by target customers could make us liable for warranty claims and pecuniary and reputational damages. In our target markets, our products may be placed in physical locations and environments that present harsh operating conditions, or that present a risk of product damage due to accidents or vandalism. This may result in more product failures than we anticipate, and may require us to provide warranties for our products beyond our knowledge of their performance. This could increase the rate of customer returns and warranty claims, resulting in higher-than-expected operating costs for us. Product failures may also affect market acceptance of our products and our ability to win future business. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could affect our brand image, partner and customer demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We may require additional capital in order to execute our business plan, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We may require additional capital in order to execute on our business plan, and we may require additional capital to fund our R&D efforts and to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and we may determine to utilize our “at-the-market” offering program or engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. In order to stay on our growth trajectory and further business relationships with current or potential customers or partners, or for other reasons, we may issue equity or equity-linked securities to such current or potential customers or partners. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, particularly in an uncertain economic environment. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position.
If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt, including through our “at-the-market” offering program, or other equity-linked securities or if we issue equity or equity-linked securities to current or potential customers to further business relationships, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. Any debt 
19
Table of C
ontents
financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited and our business results and operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Market adoption of lidar remains uncertain, and it is difficult to forecast long-term end-customer adoption rates and demand for our products.
The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of our digital lidar sensors and accessories. Given the evolving nature of the markets in which we operate, it is difficult to predict the customer demand or adoption rates for lidar technology generally or our products specifically. If demand does not develop or if we cannot accurately forecast customer demand, our future financial results, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. If current or prospective customers have a negative perception of, or experience with, lidar or a competitor’s lidar products they may be reluctant to adopt lidar in general or specifically our products. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially and adversely affect our business.
Additionally, existing or new non-lidar technologies may emerge as customers’ preferred alternative to lidar and may adversely affect the adoption of our lidar solutions and of lidar generally. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as cameras and radar, may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us or the lidar market generally to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could adversely affect the adoption of lidar and sales of our current products or materially delay the development and introduction of new and enhanced products, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our products, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.
We are pursuing opportunities in markets that involve novel applications that are rapidly evolving, and that include both technological and regulatory uncertainties, making it difficult to predict the size and timing of market opportunities. For example, autonomous driving and lidar-based ADAS applications require complex technology, stringent testing, and rigorous safety controls. Because these automotive systems are both themselves complex, and also depend on complex technologies from many suppliers, commercialization of autonomous driving or ADAS products could be delayed or impaired on account of technological capabilities that are not sufficiently advanced for deployment in vehicles. These standards may never be met at all. Additionally, ADAS has yet to, and may never, achieve widespread adoption, which would reduce demand for lidar in that market. Similar concerns are also applicable to our other three verticals.
Although we currently have contracts with numerous commercial customers across diverse markets, these customers may not be able to utilize our technology in the foreseeable future, or at all. Regulatory, safety or reliability developments, many of which are outside of our control, could also cause delays or otherwise impair commercial adoption of these new technologies, which will adversely affect our growth. Our future financial performance will depend on our ability to make timely investments in the correct market opportunities in this environment.
Many of our customers are still in the testing and development phases of applications with our products and it cannot be certain that they will commercialize products or systems with our digital lidar sensors or at all. We believe adoption of lidar products, including our digital lidar sensors, will depend on numerous factors, including: whether the technological capabilities of lidar and lidar-based products meet users’ current and evolving needs; whether the benefits of designing lidar into larger sensing systems outweigh the costs, complexity and time needed to deploy such technology or replace or modify existing systems that may have used other modalities such as cameras and radars; whether users in other applications can move beyond the testing and development phases and proceed to commercializing systems supported by lidar technology and whether lidar developers can keep pace with rapid technological changes in certain developing markets. If lidar technology generally does not achieve commercial success or if the market adoption is slower than expected, our business, results of operation and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
We may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.
We are experiencing significant growth in the scope and nature of our operations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, compliance programs and reporting systems. We are currently in the process of strengthening our compliance programs, including our compliance programs related to product certifications, quality management systems certifications, environmental certifications, export controls, privacy and cybersecurity and anti-corruption. We may not be able to implement improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems and procedures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial results. Additionally, rapid growth 
20
Table of C
ontents
in our business may place a strain on our human and capital resources. Furthermore, we expect to continue to conduct our business internationally and anticipate increased business operations in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. These diversified, global operations place increased demands on our limited resources and require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, technical, manufacturing, engineering, sales and other personnel. As our operations expand domestically and internationally, we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties across several markets.
We are focusing our current commercial efforts across four distinct target markets. We will be required to prioritize our limited financial and managerial resources as we pursue particular development and commercialization efforts in each target market. Any resources we expend on one or more of these efforts could be at the expense of other potentially profitable opportunities.
If we are not able to effectively maintain or grow our global sales and marketing organization, or maintain or grow an effective network of distributors, resellers, and integrators, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
In order to generate future sales growth, we will need to maintain or grow the size and geographic coverage of our field organization, including marketing, direct sales, customer support and technical services. Accordingly, our future success will depend largely on our ability to hire, train, retain, and motivate skilled regional sales managers and direct sales representatives with significant technical knowledge and understanding of our products. Because of the competition for their skillset, we may not be able to attract or retain such personnel on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to maintain or grow our global sales and marketing organizations, we may not be able to increase our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we rely on a network of independent distributors to help generate sales of our products internationally. If a dispute arises with a distributor or if we terminate our relationship with a distributor or a distributor goes out of business, it may take time to identify an alternative distributor, to train new personnel to market our products, and our ability to sell our products in a region formerly serviced by a terminated distributor could be harmed. In addition, our distributors may not successfully market and sell our products and may not devote sufficient time and resources that we believe are necessary to enable our products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance. Any of these factors could reduce our revenue or impair our revenue growth in affected markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation. In addition, if an independent distributor were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent that distributor from soliciting business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect us. As a result of our reliance on third-party distributors, we may be subject to disruptions and increased costs due to factors beyond our control, including labor strikes, third-party errors and other issues. If the services of any of these third-party distributors become unsatisfactory, we may experience delays in meeting our customers’ demands and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to deliver products in a timely manner may damage our reputation and could cause us to lose potential customers.
Our forecasts of market growth may not be accurate.
Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The forecasts and estimates relating to the expected size and growth of the markets for lidar-based technology may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our future growth is subject to many factors, including market adoption of our products, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts and estimates of market size and growth described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures, should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.
Our sales and operations in international markets expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks.
International sales comprise a significant amount of our overall revenue and while growing our international sales is an important part of our growth strategy, these efforts may not be successful. International operations are subject to a number of other risks, including:
•
import and export laws and the impact of tariffs;
•
exchange rate fluctuations;     
•
political and economic instability, war, international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, particularly in emerging markets and the geographic regions affected by the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars; 
21

•
uncertainty regarding the trade relationships among the United States, Canada, China, Mexico and Taiwan, as well as other countries, and related impacts to our supply chain;
•
potential for violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and fraud;
•
preference for locally branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition;
•
increased difficulty in managing inventory; 
•
increased risk in collecting trade receivables;    
•
delayed revenue recognition;
•
less effective protection and/or lack of enforceability of intellectual property;
•
stringent regulation of the autonomous or other systems or products using our products and stringent consumer protection and product compliance regulations, including but not limited to General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, European competition law, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the European Ecodesign Directive that are costly to comply with and may vary from country to country;     
•
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; 
•
natural disasters and severe weather events including earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, rising sea levels, as well as other impacts of climate change;
•
withdrawals from, or renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting countries in which we do business;
•
changes in local tax and customs duty laws or changes in the enforcement, application or interpretation of such laws; and 
•
U.S. government’s restrictions on certain technology transfer to certain countries of concern.
The occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our business, operating results, and financial condition.
We are subject to the risk of cancellation or postponement of our contracts with customers or the unsuccessful implementation of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have experienced, and may experience in the future, unexpected cancellations of major purchases of our products, which has affected and may adversely affect our results of operations. Prospective customers across our target markets generally must make significant commitments of resources to test and validate our products and confirm that they can be integrated with other technologies before including them in any particular system, product or model. Our products must meet customer specifications for quality, reliability and performance. Integration of our products may reveal errors, defects or incompatibilities with other sensing modalities that, if we are unable to correct them, may result in loss of customers, loss of market share, damage to our brand and reputation, increased service and replacement costs, lack of profitability, and constitute a hindrance to market acceptance. Although our agreements may contain provisions that aim at limiting our liability for damages resulting from defects in our products, such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforceable or otherwise effectively protect us from such claims, and we may have to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in our products or in their solutions that incorporate our products. These liabilities may also include costs incurred by our channel partners or end users to correct problems or replace our products, which could adversely affect our operating results and business prospects. These inherent operational risks are all the more important that the development cycles of our products with new customers vary widely depending on the application, market, customer and the complexity of the product. In our four target markets, development cycles can be six months to seven or more years. These development cycles require us to invest significant resources prior to realizing any revenue from the commercialization. Our revenue growth may be impaired if the system, product or vehicle model that includes our digital lidar sensors is unsuccessful, including for reasons unrelated to our technology or software. Long development cycles and product cancellations or postponements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we do not adequately manage our inventory, we could lose sales or incur higher inventory-related expenses, which could negatively affect our operating results.
To ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs and expenses, place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and manufacturing partners and manufacture products based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Fluctuations in the adoption of lidar products may affect our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, gross margins, cash flows and profitability. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including the rapidly changing nature of our current target markets, the uncertainty surrounding the market acceptance and commercialization of lidar technology, the emergence of new markets, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products and services of our competitors, product introductions by 
22
Table of C
ontents
competitors, market or supply chain disruptions due to public health crises, and any associated work stoppages or interruptions, unanticipated changes in general market conditions and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. We may face challenges acquiring adequate supplies to manufacture our products and we, Benchmark and Fabrinet may not be able to manufacture our sensors at a rate necessary to satisfy the levels of demand, which would negatively affect our short-term and long-term growth. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we may not carry or be able to obtain from our suppliers a significant amount of inventory to satisfy short-term demand increases. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale, which has forced us to record inventory write-downs in the past
Inventory levels in excess of customer demand have resulted and may in the future result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would adversely affect our financial results, including our gross margin, and have a negative effect on our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, we may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our brand and customer relationships and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
We are exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of our inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.
We record a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. We also accrue necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. We review long-lived assets, including capital assets held at our suppliers’ facilities, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we record a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. No assurance can be given that we will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which we compete.
We order components for our products and build inventory in advance of product manufacturing and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to three months. Because our target markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, and because we have limited sales history, there is a risk we will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize our firm purchase commitments.
Our business could be materially and adversely affected if our customers become unable to, or otherwise do not, pay their invoices.
If one or more of our major customers is unable to pay our invoices as they become due or a customer simply refuses to make such payments if it experiences financial difficulties, our business would be adversely affected. If a major customer were to enter into bankruptcy proceedings or similar proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, payments received may be subject to clawback and we could be forced to record a substantial loss. Additionally, a number of our customers are startup companies, small and mid-sized businesses, that are privately funded, have limited resources, and do not have a history of creditworthiness that we can audit to determine reliability and increase the potential risk to record potential losses. These companies could fail to raise enough capital and have to shut down operations. Even if they are financially solvent and stable and we are successful in securing a commercial relationship with them, their business plans for future programs may be inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and less structured than established companies. We generally do not require collateral or other security deposits for accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, the Company considers customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer as well as changes in customer payment terms when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts. Periodically, we may require a customer to make advanced payments in advance of product shipments. These measures to reduce credit risk may not be sufficient and our accounts receivable could be impaired or our revenues adversely impacted.
We are exposed to credit risk on our trade accounts receivable, supplier non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.
We sell our products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and educational customers. Our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. Our exposure to credit and collectability risk on our trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. We also have unsecured supplier non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for us. In addition, from time to time, we may make prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. While we are implementing procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our trade and 
23
Table of C
ontents
supplier non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits before their expiration (if we generate taxable income at all).
In addition, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by certain significant shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have completed an analysis of Section 382 ownership changes in our stock through February 10, 2023 and have concluded that we have experienced ownership changes that will result in limitations in our ability to use an immaterial amount of tax credit carryforwards. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock. If it is determined that we undergo one or more ownership changes in the future, then our ability to utilize our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited or eliminated. 
Key components in our products come from limited or single source third-party suppliers, and we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture a significant portion of our products for the foreseeable future. Interruptions in our relationships with these third parties could adversely impact our business.
We rely on third-party manufacturers, including Benchmark and Fabrinet, to supply a substantial portion of our products. These arrangements are intended to lower our operating costs, but they also reduce our direct control over production and distribution. This diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or our flexibility to respond to changing conditions. If Benchmark or any of our third-party component suppliers or logistics and transportation partners experience interruptions, delays or disruptions in supplying their products or services, including by natural disasters, trade restrictions, public health crises, or work stoppages or capacity constraints, our ability to ship products to distributors and customers may be delayed. Similarly, we source components from countries that may be impacted by tariffs under the current U.S. government, including Canada, China, and Mexico. If the cost of products sourced from these or certain other countries increase significantly due to tariffs or trade restrictions, we may not be able to change suppliers or otherwise avoid or mitigate such costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could result in financial distress among third-party suppliers or manufacturers upon which we rely, thereby increasing the risk of disruption of supplies necessary to fulfill our production requirements and meet customer demands. Additionally, if any of these third parties on whom we rely were to experience quality control problems in their operations and our products do not meet customer or regulatory requirements, we could be required to cover the cost of repair or replacement of any defective products. These delays or product quality issues could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill orders and could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition, such delays or issues with product quality could adversely affect our reputation and our relationship with our customers, distributors, value added software resellers, and integrators.
If these third parties experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity or other difficulties, or experience shortages in required components, or if they are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products in required volumes or at all, our supply may be disrupted, we may be required to seek alternate manufacturers and we may be required to re-design our products. It would be time consuming, and could be costly and impracticable, to begin to use new manufacturers, components or designs, and such changes could cause significant interruptions in supply and could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries and may subsequently lead to the loss of sales. While we take measures to protect our trade secrets, the use of third-party suppliers and manufacturers may also risk disclosure of our innovative and proprietary manufacturing methodologies, which could adversely affect our business.
We believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality suppliers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to obtain additional or alternative supplier arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Our suppliers could also discontinue or modify components used in our products. In some cases, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. We may in the future experience component shortages and price fluctuations of certain key components and materials, and the predictability of the availability and pricing of these components may be limited. Component shortages or pricing fluctuations could be material in the future. In the event of a component shortage, supply interruption or material pricing change from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner or at all in the case of sole or limited sources. 
24
Table of C
ontents
Developing alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our ability to meet our requirements or to fill customer orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers. This could adversely affect our relationships with customers and distributors and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, increased component costs could result in lower gross margins. Even where we are able to pass increased component costs along to our customers, there may be a lapse of time before it is possible to do so, such that we must absorb the increased cost. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers, and cause our customers to use competitors’ products instead of ours.
Should operations at our third-party suppliers, including Benchmark and Fabrinet, encounter disruptions or losses that may be caused by work stoppages, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters, it could result in delays, postponement or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such production disruption is resolved or an alternate source of production or supply is secured.
Outsourcing a substantial percentage of our manufacturing outside of the United States involves certain risks or may not be successful, which could harm our ability to deliver products and recognize revenue.
Historically, we manufactured all of our digital sensors at our facility in San Francisco, California. We continue to maintain a portion of our manufacturing at this facility, including any production of Buy America and Buy American-compliant sensors;
 however, in 2019, 
we began moving a portion of our manufacturing operations to a manufacturing facility in Thailand in connection with our relationship with Benchmark, which for the year ended December 31, 2024, accounted for the majority of our OS sensor manufacturing output. After the merger with Velodyne, we moved manufacturing operations of Velodyne sensors to a Fabrinet facility in Thailand. The Company expects to continue to outsource the higher volume product line manufacturing to its manufacturing partners, Benchmark and Fabrinet. We have invested in manufacturing process equipment which is held at Benchmark and Fabrinet facilities. We expect to make additional capital expenditures and to continue to devote the attention of our management and other personnel to the operations located at our outsourced manufacturing partners. We may also need to make prepayments to some of our suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if any of the Company’s manufacturing partners or suppliers experiences severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply would be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments would be negatively impacted. In such cases the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel to these relationships that were diverted from our other business operations would not be recoverable. 
Additionally, manufacturing outside the United States is subject to several inherent risks, including:
•
foreign currency fluctuations;
•
local economic conditions;
•
political instability; 
•
import or export requirements;
•
foreign government regulatory requirements;
•
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•
tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions; and 
•
potentially adverse tax consequences.
We do not currently have long-term, committed supply contracts with many of our suppliers. Loss of one or more of these suppliers or our inability to identify and establish relationships with new suppliers could harm our business and impede our growth.
Because we do not maintain long-term supply contracts with many of our suppliers, they could seek to alter or terminate their relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. The production of our products is dependent on producing or sourcing certain key components, including semiconductor chips, and raw materials at acceptable price levels. If we are unable to adequately reduce and control the costs of such key components, we will be unable to realize manufacturing costs targets, which could reduce the market adoption of our products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely impact our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Adverse conditions in the industries we target or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations.
While we make our strategic planning decisions based on the assumption that the markets we are targeting will grow, our business is dependent, in large part on, and directly affected by, business cycles and other factors affecting the robotics, industrial automation, smart infrastructure, and transportation industries and global economy generally. Our target markets are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, inflation, environmental impact, governmental incentives and regulatory requirements, political volatility, labor relations issues, trade agreements and other factors.
For example, general inflation in the United States, Europe and other geographies has risen significantly in recent years. General inflation, including rising prices for inputs and rising wages, as well as rising interest rates negatively impact our business by increasing our operating costs. General inflation also negatively impacts our business by decreasing the capital for our customers to deploy to purchase our products. Inflation may cause our customers to reduce or delay orders for our products thereby causing a decrease in sales. Increased instability relating to this higher inflation as well as rising interest rates may enhance volatility in currency exchange rates, limit our suppliers’ and customers’ access to credit and limit our ability to access debt and equity financing. These uncertainties may make it difficult for us and our suppliers and customers to accurately plan future business activities and materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
Our future success depends in part on recruiting and retaining key personnel and if we fail to do so, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. We are currently a small organization and may need to hire additional qualified personnel to effectively implement our strategic plan.
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, technical, manufacturing, engineering and sales personnel. In particular, our success may depend on our ability to recruit and retain management personnel who are qualified to manage a public company. We are highly dependent on our senior management, including our founders, Angus Pacala and Mark Frichtl. If any of such persons left, our business could be harmed. All of our U.S. based employees are “at-will” employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could delay or have an impact on the successful commercialization of our products. We do not maintain key man insurance.
Our ability to successfully execute on our strategic plan depends in part on our ability to continue to appropriately build our organization and hire qualified personnel, especially with engineering, sales, technical, and manufacturing expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is especially severe in the San Francisco Bay Area. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, it may adversely affect our business and our growth prospects.
Some of our employees are employed by professional employer organizations which may have unexpected costs that could adversely impact our business.
We contract with non-US professional employer organizations (“PEOs”), to administer our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for some of our subsidiaries’ employees outside of the United States. Although our subsidiaries recruit and select these employees, their employment relationship is with the relevant PEO. Accordingly, these employees are compensated through the PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll-related reports from the PEO. In addition, some of these employees may receive stock compensation directly from the Company. The PEO relationship streamlines hiring and employee maintenance, and enables management to focus on issues other than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. For example, if the PEO is unable to or otherwise fails to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with other applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions provided to us by the PEOs. In certain non-US jurisdictions, despite the PEO relationship, there is a risk that the employee may nonetheless be deemed our direct employee and that the Company may be deemed to have a permanent operation in a non-US jurisdiction. Court and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such monetary penalties may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
If we choose to acquire or invest in new businesses, products, or technologies, such acquisitions or investments may not be completed or result in the anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.
Our success depends on our ability to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and advances in technologies. Failure to successfully identify, complete, manage and integrate acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and 
26
Table of C
ontents
could cause our stock price to decline. We continue to search for viable acquisition candidates or strategic transactions that would expand our market sector and/or global presence, as well as additional products appropriate for current distribution channels. Accordingly, we have previously pursued and may in the future pursue the acquisition of new businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them internally. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage the expanded business following these acquisitions, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity associated with such acquisitions. For example, in February 2023, we completed the Velodyne Merger and, in October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sense. In connection with any acquisitions, we could issue additional equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders, incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions or assume significant liabilities.
Acquisitions involve many and diverse risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with conduction due diligence, problems integrating the purchased operations, assets, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, liabilities, and economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges due to our inexperience operating in new regions or countries, inability to achieve anticipated synergies, overpaying for acquisitions, invalid sales assumptions underlying potential acquisitions, issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies, diversion of management attention, adverse effects on existing business relationships or acquired company business relationships, risks associated with entering new markets, potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses, increased legal, accounting and compliance costs,

and failure to successfully integrate acquired companies, or retain key personnel from the acquired company. Acquisitions may divert our attention from our core business. Acquisitions may require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to testing on a regular basis and potential period impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We compete with other companies for these opportunities, and we may be unable to consummate such acquisitions or other strategic transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, acquired businesses may have ongoing or potential liabilities, legal claims (including tort and/or personal injury claims) or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. Even if we are aware of such liabilities, claims or issues, we may not be able to accurately estimate the magnitude of the related liabilities and damages. In particular, to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to their customers, or failed to satisfy legal obligations to employees or third parties, we, as the successor, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairment in the future that could harm our financial results. If we were to issue additional equity in connection with such acquisitions, this may dilute our stockholders.
Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business
Our products are frequently used in applications that are subject to evolving regulations and standards. Similarly, our operations are subject to evolving regulations and laws.
Our customers may use our products for regulated and standardized applications that require our products to comply with regulations and standards that are applicable to both our products and to those industries and applications, including functional safety and product reliability standards. New regulations and industry standards may be adopted that result in delays or cancellations of programs. If we decide not to pursue or fail to achieve these regulatory or industry certifications, we may lose existing or potential commercial opportunities or be exposed to legal liability from regulators.
Similarly, our operations are subject to an evolving regulatory environment. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied, which may decrease customer spending, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Our products and solutions are subject to certain U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. U.S. export control laws and regulations and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our productions and solutions from being provided to entities subject to these restrictions, our products could find their way to such prohibited 
27
Table of C
ontents
entities. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, or reputational harm.
In addition, complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and create delays in the introduction of our products and solutions in some international markets, and, in some cases, prevent the export of our software and services to some countries altogether. Exports of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If a license is required from a government agency prior to sale, no exports may occur until the appropriate approvals are obtained. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, penalties could be imposed, including substantial monetary fines and/or denial of export privileges. In addition, in extreme cases responsible employees or managers can be held criminally liable for such violations.
Changes to trade policy, tariffs and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or changes in global, political, regulatory and economic conditions affecting U.S. trade, manufacturing, development or investment, could have an adverse effect on business. In recent months, the U.S. has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. A number of other nations have proposed or instituted similar measures directed at trade with the United States in response. As a result of these developments, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade that could adversely affect our business. Any tariffs or sanctions that impact the Company’s custom-made components, such as our micro-optics or custom SoC, may disproportionately impact our business, prospects and operations. As additional trade-related policies are instituted, we may need to modify our business operations to comply and adapt to such developments, which may be time-consuming and expensive or which we may not be able to do successfully at all.
Moreover, the potential for further or new tariffs or trade restrictions between the United States and Thailand, China, Canada, Europe and Mexico, and the resulting environment of retaliatory trade or other practices could materially harm our ability to obtain necessary materials or manufactured products. For example, tariffs on certain Canadian or Chinese origin goods may impact the cost of material and components that we import or that are imported on our behalf by our manufacturing partners or suppliers. Similarly, the majority of our end-products are manufactured in Thailand and any increased costs of manufacturing there, such as tariffs on goods imported from Thailand, would materially adversely affect our operations. The indirect impact of inflationary pressure on costs throughout our supply chain and the direct impact, for example, on costs of material and components we import or that are imported on our behalf by our manufacturing partners or suppliers from countries adversely impacted by trade relations with the United States, may result in higher input costs and lower margins on certain products we sell, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and cash flows.
We have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position.
We have been and may in the future be, from time to time, involved in litigation, regulatory proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes and these matters may be significant. These matters may include, without limitation, disputes with our distributors, suppliers and customers, intellectual property claims, stockholder litigation, government investigations, class action lawsuits, personal injury claims, environmental issues, customs and value-added tax disputes and employment and tax issues. In addition, we have in the past and could face in the future a variety of labor and employment claims against us, which could include but is not limited to general discrimination, wage and hour, privacy, ERISA or disability claims. In such matters, government agencies or private parties may seek to recover from us large, indeterminate amounts in penalties or monetary damages (including, in some cases, treble or punitive damages) or seek to limit our operations in some way. These types of lawsuits could require significant management time and attention or could involve substantial legal liability, adverse regulatory outcomes, or substantial expenses to defend. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues and create risks and uncertainties. 
For descriptions of legal proceedings to which we are party, including proceedings assumed in connection with the Velodyne Merger, see Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have in the past and could in the future be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones, and we may not prevail. No assurances can be given that any proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our operating results and consolidated financial position or that our available insurance will mitigate this impact.

We are subject to, and must remain in compliance with, numerous laws and governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution and sale of our products. Some of our customers also require that we comply with their own unique requirements relating to these matters.
We manufacture and sell products that contain components, which may contain materials that are subject to government regulation in both the locations where we manufacture and assemble our products, as well as the locations where we sell our products. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process which requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with existing regulations in each market where we operate. If there is an unanticipated new regulation that significantly impacts our use and sourcing of various components or requires more expensive components, that regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are not currently in compliance with existing regulations, or we fail to adhere to new regulations or fail to continually monitor the updates, we may incur costs in remedying our non-compliance and it may disrupt our operations. In addition, current or proposed regulations may adversely impact the availability of supplies needed to manufacture our products. For example, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act effectively bans all products from China’s Xinjiang province due to concerns that the goods were produced with forced labor, which is having adverse impacts on global supply chains. In such circumstances, we may also be subject to litigation, lose customers, suffer negative publicity and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We and our vendors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in expanding production facilities.
Environmental pollution and climate change have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and we believe this will continue both in scope and in the number of countries participating. In addition, as climate change issues become more prevalent, foreign, federal, state and local governments and our customers have increased their focus on environmental sustainability, which has resulted in, and may result in new, regulations and customer requirements, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to effectively address concerns about environmental impact, our reputation could be negatively impacted, and our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer. These regulations and requirements apply to our vendors and suppliers, as well. To the extent compliance with, or the effect of, these regulations and requirements on vendors and suppliers result in their inability to deliver their products to us on time or at all, this could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the State of California has enacted a number of laws that require reporting on carbon neutrality claims and use of carbon removal credits and direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks. The SEC also adopted and then stayed rules that would require companies to provide certain climate-related disclosures. Additional local, state, federal and international laws and rules with respect to sustainability and environmental matters which have been passed or proposed may be enacted in the future and the extent and scope of their requirements and impact on our business are unknown. Such rules, as well as other ESG and sustainability-related regulation and legislation, may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board of directors.
Any new or modified environmental regulations or laws may increase the cost of raw materials or components we use in our products. Environmental regulations require us to continually reduce product energy usage, monitor and exclude an expanding list of restricted substances and to participate in required recovery and recycling of our products. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we have limited experience complying with them. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third-party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.
If contamination is found at properties we operate or formerly operated, this may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault. Costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
Failure to meet evolving and changing environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) expectations or standards or to achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
We experience pressure to make commitments or set goals or targets relating to ESG matters that affect companies in our industry, including the design and implementation of specific risk mitigation strategic initiatives relating to environmental sustainability. If we are not effective in addressing ESG matters affecting our industry, such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility, among other issues, or setting and meeting relevant 
29

sustainability commitments, goals, or targets, our reputation may suffer. As we continue to develop our voluntary ESG program and disclosures, there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders will determine that these programs and disclosures are sufficiently robust, and we cannot assure that our stakeholders will agree with our ESG strategies. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain any announced goals related to our sustainability program, as statements regarding our sustainability goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Furthermore, both advocates and opponents of such ESG matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns, shareholder proposals, and litigation to advance their perspectives. There has similarly been an increase in activism and litigation alleging that corporate diversity, equity and inclusion programs may discriminate against certain groups. Changing stakeholder expectations, changing laws, evolving voluntary and regulatory disclosure standards, and our efforts to manage and report on ESG issues present operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, including on our reputation and stock price.
We are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the Money Laundering Control Act 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 and 1957, and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector and failing to prevent bribery, and require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal accounting controls designed to prevent any such actions. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.
As we increase our international cross-border business and expand our operations abroad, we may continue to engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international business, our risks under these laws may increase.
Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas are received or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.
Our business may be adversely affected if it fails to comply with the regulatory requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).
As a lidar technology company, we are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the FDA. Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which could require us to cease distribution of our products, recall or remediate products already distributed to customers, or subject us to FDA enforcement.
We are exposed to risks related to the use of AI tools by us and others. 
Although we are evaluating and, where we believe appropriate, incorporating the use of AI tools into our operations, such as the use of generative AI tools to assist in the development of code, our use of such tools may subject us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory and other risks, and there can be no assurance that our use of AI tools will enhance our 
30
Table of C
ontents
business operations or result in a benefit to us. Our competitors may be more successful in their use of AI tools, including by developing superior products or improving their operations with the assistance of AI. Additionally, there could be adverse impacts from inaccurate or flawed algorithms. Our use of AI tools could also result in the loss of confidential information or intellectual property or an inability to claim or enforce intellectual property rights, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the unauthorized use of Company data. The jurisdictions in which we conduct business have adopted and may adopt laws and regulations related to AI, which could cause us to incur greater compliance costs, limit our use of AI tools, or subject us to regulatory investigations and actions or legal liabilities.
Failures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain and may require improvements in, or changes to, our policies and operations.
We receive, store, handle, transmit, use, and otherwise process business information and information related to individuals, including from and about actual and prospective customers, employees, business contacts, service providers, and others. We also depend on a number of third-party vendors in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process data on our behalf. Our current and potential future operations and sales subject us to laws and regulations addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, processing, and protection of a variety of types of data. For example, we are subject to General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), each of which provide for potentially material penalties for non-compliance. These regimes, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on data collection, uses, and sharing that may impact our operations and the development of our business. The full impact of these privacy regimes, and other privacy, data protection, and information security laws we may be subject to, on our business is rapidly evolving across jurisdictions and remains uncertain at this time. 
Since these data security regimes are evolving, uncertain, and complex, especially for a global business like ours, we may need to update or enhance our compliance measures as our products, markets and customer demands further develop, and these updates or enhancements may require implementation costs. In addition, we may not be able to monitor and react to all legal developments in a timely manner. Any compliance measures we do adopt may prove ineffective. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with current and future regulatory or customer-driven privacy, data protection, and information security requirements, or to prevent or mitigate security breaches, cyber-attacks, or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of data, or any security issues or cyber-attacks affecting us, could result in significant liability, costs (including the costs of mitigation and recovery), and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, loss of proprietary information and data, disruption to our business and relationships, and diminished ability to retain or attract customers and business partners. Such events may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause customers and business partners to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result of operations, financial condition, and business.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent competitors or other unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our technology.
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights covering our technology and products, and to maintain adequate legal protection for our technology and products in the United States and worldwide. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protections.
We can make no assurances whether any of our pending patent applications will mature into issued patents, or that any of our pending trademark applications will be registered, in a manner that gives us any or adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages. We also do not know whether any patents issued to us or any trademarks registered by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our portfolio of currently-issued patents and registered trademarks, and any patents that may be issued, any copyrights and trademarks that may be registered in the future, may not provide sufficiently broad protections to us, or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We cannot be certain that the actions we have undertaken to protect our technology and products will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our products. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies and products that compete with ours, or infringe our intellectual property.
We have filed for patents and trademarks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available, and we may not have applied for protections in all countries in which we operate or sell our products. 
31
Table of C

Though we may have obtained intellectual property and related proprietary rights in various jurisdictions, it may prove difficult to enforce our intellectual property rights in practice. Discovering and protecting against unauthorized use of our intellectual property, products and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly internationally. We believe that our patents are foundational in the area of lidar products, and intend to enforce our intellectual property rights. Competitors and other unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer our lidar technology and other aspects of our solutions that we consider proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our products, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to block the importation of infringing products into the United States or other markets. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering infringing products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage, market share and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
Claims that we are infringing third-party intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and adversely affect our business.
Any intellectual property and related contractual litigation, if it is initiated in the future by us or a third-party, would result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Such claims may also divert management resources and attention away from other business efforts and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments that may not be acceptable to us. Further, a party making such a claim against us, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or such a party could obtain an injunction. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and adversely affect our ability to offer our products to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense.  Even if we obtain favorable outcomes in any such litigation, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies, or may have incurred costs that threaten our financial stability. Assertions of our attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also lead these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us or seek invalidation or a narrowed scope of our rights, in whole or in part. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 
Lidar is a heavily populated intellectual property field, in which many companies, both within and outside of the lidar industry, hold patents covering lidar products and other adjacent technologies. In addition to patents, companies in the lidar industry typically rely on copyrights and trade secrets to protect their technology. As a result, there has been frequent litigation in the lidar industry based on allegations of patent infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have, and in the future may, receive inquiries from other intellectual property holders and we may become subject to claims that we infringe others’ intellectual property rights, particularly as our market presence increases, as our products expand to new use cases and geographies, and as we face increasing competition. In addition, parties may claim that our name and the branding of our products infringe their trademark rights in certain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail, we may have to change the names of and branding of our products in the affected territories which would be costly and could cause market confusion.
We currently have various agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers, suppliers, and other partners from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. The scope of these indemnity obligations vary, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. Our insurance does not typically cover intellectual property infringement claims. A claim that our products infringe a third-party’s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and deter future customers from purchasing our products. Our defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against us, or our customers, suppliers or partners, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle.
Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third-party relating to infringement of its products, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our products against intellectual property infringement claims in any subsequent litigation matter in which we are a named party. Any of these results could adversely affect our brand and operating results.
Any intellectual property and related contractual litigation, if it is initiated in the future by us or a third-party, would result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Such claims may also divert management resources and attention away from other business efforts and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments that may not be acceptable to us. Further, a party making such a claim against us, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or such a party could obtain an injunction. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and adversely affect our ability to offer our products to our customers

and may require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. Even if we obtain favorable outcomes in any such litigation, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies, or may have incurred costs that threaten our financial stability. Assertions of our rights against third parties could also lead third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us or seek invalidation or a narrowed scope of our rights, in whole or in part. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
Our intellectual property applications may not issue or be registered, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.
We cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed any particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application to, or otherwise publicly disclosed, subject matter that we are seeking to protect in a given patent application, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. We also cannot be certain whether the claims included in a patent application will ultimately be granted as an issued patent since the patent office of the jurisdiction in which a patent application is filed may rule that the subject matter we are seeking to patent is not novel or is obvious or otherwise non-inventive or rule that the patent application and/or claims of the patent application do not comply with one or more other requirements of the patent laws of the jurisdiction. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary processes and know-how. 
We rely on proprietary information (including, for example, trade secrets, know-how and confidential information) to protect intellectual property that may not be patentable or subject to copyright or trademark protection, or that we believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure. We may seek to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements, or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use provisions with our employees, consultants, contractors and third parties. We may fail, however, to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if properly executed and entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. Additionally, we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our current or future manufacturing partners and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. In addition, our proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and other third parties use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection for our proprietary information could adversely affect our competitive business position. Furthermore, laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets where we operate may afford little or no protection to our trade secrets.
We also rely on security measures, both physical and electronic, to protect our proprietary information, but we cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be breached or provide adequate protection for our property. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. Also, we may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees’ former employers.
We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of one or more of an employee’s former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend us against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources.

Risks Related to Being a Public Company and our Capital Structure
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or cause our access to the capital markets to be impaired.
We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Additionally, ineffective internal control could expose us to an increased risk of financial reporting fraud and the misappropriation of assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list or to other regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.
We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of internal controls and accounting knowledge, experience, and training commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weakness:
•
We did not design and maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting process to ensure, for other than journal entries, that segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts were identified, reviewed and mitigated by appropriately designed mitigating controls as needed to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures.
The material weakness related to the control environment resulted in adjustments to several account balances and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, adjustments to the equity and warrant liabilities accounts and related disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and an immaterial adjustment which was recorded prior to the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024. The material weakness related to segregation of duties did not result in a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements. 
Additionally, each of these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
As it relates to the above material weaknesses that continued to exist as of December 31, 2024, our management is committed and continues to make progress to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We continued implementation of a plan to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the above material weaknesses. These remediation measures are ongoing and include the following:
•
Improve internal controls to ensure that segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts are timely identified, reviewed and mitigated by appropriately designed mitigating controls and procedures. This includes periodic monitoring of changes in roles and responsibilities that could impact SOD conflicts within the period-end financial reporting process.
•
Continuing to recruit personnel with appropriate internal controls, accounting knowledge and experience commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements, in addition to engaging and utilizing third party consultants and specialists. Our management also continued to reallocate and align roles and responsibilities within the accounting team to optimize and leverage the skills and experience of various personnel.
•
Continuing to provide internal control training for personnel responsible for implementing internal controls for the Company.
These investments in resources have improved the stability of our accounting organization. While significant progress has been made in response to the material weaknesses, time is needed to demonstrate sustainability as it relates to our internal control over financial reporting and improvements made to our complement of resources, including demonstrating sustained operating effectiveness of our internal controls related to SOD. We are committed to continuous improvement and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting.

As a public company, we are required pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”) to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in internal control over financial reporting. In the future, to the extent we are considered an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC. We are also required to disclose material changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the stock exchange on which our securities are listed or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. 
Certain of our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of such warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.
We have determined to classify the private placement warrants assumed from CLA as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we recognize non-cash gains or losses on the private placement warrants each reporting period and the amount of such gains or losses has been material and could continue to be material in the future. Our accounting treatment of our warrants is based on its current interpretation of the SEC Statement and other guidance and may change in light of any further interpretive guidance, as may be applicable.
There can be no assurance that we, our common stock or our warrants will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).
If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum share price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities, including our warrants. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the securities and would impair stockholders’ ability to trade in the Company’s securities. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our securities from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum share price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from the Nasdaq, for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. If our securities become illiquid, stockholders may be unable to trade their securities unless a market can be established or sustained, and similarly if investors are precluded from trading their securities, it could have adverse consequences on our ability to raise more capital.
Amazon owns a warrant to purchase a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, and it may in the future be able to influence the Company’s corporate decisions.
Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), holds a warrant (“Amazon Warrant”) to acquire, following customary antidilution adjustments, up to an aggregate of 3,267,890 (2,160,304 of which are currently vested) shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $50.64

per share, representing 6.1% of our outstanding common stock as of March 17, 2025. We assumed the Amazon Warrant as part of the Velodyne Merger. The exercise price and the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the Amazon Warrant are subject to further antidilution adjustments, including in the event we make certain sales of common stock (or securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock) at a price less than the exercise price of the Amazon Warrant. If Amazon were to exercise the Amazon Warrant to purchase significant amounts of our common stock, it may be able to exert significant control over us. It also may have interests that differ from other stockholders and may vote or otherwise act in ways with which we or other stockholders disagree or that may be adverse to the interests of our stockholders.
The price of our common stock and warrants may be volatile.
The price of our common stock, as well as our warrants, may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:
•
changes in the industries in which we and our customers operate;
•
developments involving our competitors;
•
changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;
•
variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general; 
•
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;
35
Table of C
ontents
•
publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;
•
the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; 
•
actions by stockholders, including the sale by significant stockholders of any of their shares of our common stock;
•
additions and departures of key personnel;
•
commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving our Company;
•
changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;
•
the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale; and
•
general economic, political and social conditions, such as the effects of public health crises, recessions, interest rates, local and national elections, tariffs, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism.
These market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock and warrants regardless of our operating performance.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future agreements and financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.
If analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly.
Holders of our publicly traded warrants will not be permitted to exercise their warrants unless the warrants remain registered or certain exemptions are available.
If the issuance of the common stock upon exercise of our publicly traded warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the common stock included in the units.
If the common stock issuable upon exercise of the publicly traded warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, under the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do so for cash and, instead, will be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.
In no event will warrants be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration or qualification is available.
If our common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of “covered securities” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, not permit holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so for cash and, instead, require them to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement or register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws.

Holders of our publicly traded warrants may only be able to exercise such warrants on a “cashless basis” under certain circumstances, and if they do so, they will receive fewer shares of common stock from such exercise than if they were to exercise such warrants for cash.
The warrant agreements provide that in the following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act: (i) if the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement; (ii) if we have so elected and the common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of “covered securities” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act; and (iii) if we have so elected and we call the public warrants for redemption. If holder exercises public warrants on a cashless basis, they would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of our common stock (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” is the average reported closing price of the common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, an impacted warrant holder would receive fewer shares of common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.
We may amend the terms of the publicly traded warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of the publicly traded warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without warrant holder approval.
Our publicly traded warrants were issued in registered forms under warrant agreements between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us (or formerly, Velodyne). The warrant agreements provide that the terms of each class of warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for certain limited administrative provisions, and that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants in such class is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of publicly traded warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of either class of public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder of such class of public warrants if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants in such class approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding class of public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or shares, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.
Our warrant agreements designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.
Our warrant agreements for our publicly traded warrants provide that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreements, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreements will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreements, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.
This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision in 
37

our warrant agreements inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.
We may redeem unexpired publicly traded warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making such warrants worthless.
We have the ability to redeem the outstanding publicly traded warrants at any time prior to their expiration. For the class of publicly traded warrants traded under the symbol “OUSTZ”, we may redeem such warrants at a price of $0.10 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $180.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption to the warrant holders and provided certain other conditions are met. For the class of publicly traded warrants traded under the symbol “OUSTW”, we may redeem such warrants at a price of $0.10 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $219.41 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption to the warrant holders and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants initially issued by CLA will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by Colonnade Sponsor LLC or its permitted transferees.
Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.
Our Certification of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporations Law (“DGCL”) contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, the Certification of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions regarding:
•
providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; 
•
the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 
•
the Certificate of Incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 
•
the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;
•
the ability of our board of directors to amend the Bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the Bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and
•
advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our board of directors or management.

The provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation requiring exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation (as each may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action, suit or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer or stockholder governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such Securities Act claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, the Certificate of Incorporation will also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; however, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision, and investors cannot waive compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any cause of action arising under the Securities Act, any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.
We may be subject to securities litigation, class action and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and could divert management attention away from other business concerns.
The market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Additionally, securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies included in the notes to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
General Risk Factors
Our facilities in California are located near an earthquake fault and an earthquake or other natural disaster or resource shortage could disrupt our operations.
Important documents and records for our products and manufacturing operations are located in our various facilities in San Francisco, California near active earthquake zones. In the event of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, drought, flood or fire or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation we do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan, and therefore could experience a significant business interruption. In addition, California has from time to time experienced shortages of water, natural gas, and electric power. Future shortages and conservation measures could impact our operations and result in increased expenses. In addition, we rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. To the extent 
39
Table of C
ontents
that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or impede our suppliers’ ability to timely deliver product components, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
We and our third-party providers are subject to cybersecurity risks, and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident, or breach of security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
We rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, “IT Systems”). We own and manage some of these IT Systems, but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services. We and certain of our third-party providers collect, maintain and process data about customers, employees, business partners and others, including information about individuals — as well as proprietary information belonging to our business such as trade secrets (collectively, “Confidential Information”).
We and our third-party vendors and suppliers face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information, including from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers, and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors including acts of vandalism, malware (including ransomware), social engineering, denial or degradation of service attacks, computer viruses, software bugs or vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, human errors, malicious insiders or other similar events. Moreover, any integration of artificial intelligence in our or any third-party’s operations, products or services is expected to pose new or unknown cybersecurity risks and challenges.
We and certain of our third-party providers regularly experience actual and attempted cyberattacks and other incidents. Although none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks has had a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition to date, we cannot guarantee that any such incidents will not have such an impact in the future. For example, we are at risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of: IT Systems, including in relation to business, financial, accounting, product development, data processing or production processes, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; facility security systems, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; in-product technology owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; the integrated software in our lidar solutions; or Confidential Information that we process or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt IT Systems; result in loss of Confidential Information including intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information, certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, drivers or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; or affect the performance of in-product technology and the integrated software in our lidar solutions. 
Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools—including artificial intelligence—that circumvent security controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. As a result, we may be unable to detect, investigate, remediate or recover from future attacks or incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact to our IT Systems, Confidential Information or business. We also cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls, or procedures will be fully implemented, complied with, or adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate cyber incidents. Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these programs and processes 

require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating current programs and processes, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, production execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or produce, sell, deliver and service our solutions, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, applicable laws, regulations and contracts. We cannot be sure that the programs and processes upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these programs and processes as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our Confidential Information, including proprietary information or intellectual property, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these programs and processes do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.
A significant cyber incident could impact production capability, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation (including class actions), and require significant incident response, system restoration, or remediation and future compliance costs, any of which could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

In addition, our insurance coverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of a cyber incident, and we cannot guarantee that applicable insurance will be available to us or in the future on economically reasonable terms at all. 
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity program that seeks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s information assets, including its critical systems.
 The Company’s cybersecurity program is based on an ISO 27001 compliant Information Security Management System (ISMS). We use ISO 27001 as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. Our cybersecurity program is integrated into our overall risk management program; which is reviewed and evaluated by our Board, and shares reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial areas.
Key elements of our cybersecurity program include, but are not limited to, (i) raising security awareness of our employees and product development teams, and (ii) implementing and maintaining security operations that are designed to protect identities, networks, systems, and data and provide for detection, response, and recovery, including a cyber incident response plan.
We engage external parties to enhance our cybersecurity program and to operate a variety of operational functions. We engage consultants, advisors and vendors who are recognized for their cybersecurity expertise or products to supplement, augment and/or test specific elements of our security program. We also engage third-party specialists to conduct security assessments and independent audits of the security of the Company’s systems and networks. The results of these assessments may be used to help us improve our cybersecurity program.

The Company has adopted a third-party management policy to formalize the baseline of security controls that it expects its partners and other third-party companies (including service providers) to meet, in accordance with their criticality to our operations and respective risk profile, when directly interacting with the Company’s data. To mitigate risks that may arise from the Company’s interactions with service providers, suppliers, and vendors, we strive to ensure that our systems/services are integrated with trustworthy vendors.

Although to date we have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident resulting in an interruption of our operations, the scope or impact of any future incident cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
 For additional information on our cybersecurity risks, see 
“We and our third-party providers are subject to cybersecurity risks, and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident, or breach of security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”

Cybersecurity Governance
Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its overall risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity program.

The Audit Committee receives regular cybersecurity updates and reports from members of the Company’s executive team and the Senior Director of Information Security and Compliance and in turn briefs the full Board on these updates as part of its Committee report. In addition, the full Board receives a full report on the Company’s cybersecurity program at least annually. The Board is also apprised by the executive team and Senior Director of Information Security and Compliance of more significant or serious cybersecurity incidents.
The Company has a Breach Response Team (“BRT”) led by our 
Senior Director of Information Security
 and Compliance under the direction of our executive team, and is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Senior Director of Information Security and Compliance has day to day responsibility for the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants.

Our Senior Director of Information Security and Compliance has served in various roles in information security for over 15 years, including serving as Associate Director of Cybersecurity of a public company as well as a PCI Qualified Security Assessor at a cybersecurity consulting firm. He holds a M.S. in Computer Science and has attained various certifications, including an Advanced Computer Certificate from Stanford University
.
 Our executive team  takes steps to stay informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from the Senior Director of Information Security and Compliance and other internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information 
41

obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment. The Company’s executive team also monitors the activities of the BRT and where appropriate participates in and supports the BRT in the evaluation and remediation of actual or perceived cyber incidents in accordance with the Company’s incident response plan.
