FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may be forward-looking statements. The words “anticipates,” “believe(s),” “could,” “contemplates,”, “continue,” “expects,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential” “should,” “targets,” or “will” and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, though not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to statements regarding our ability to maintain or grow our global sales and bolster our financial position; our expected contractual obligations and capital expenditures; the capabilities of and demand for our products; our anticipated new product launches and anticipated impacts from recent product launches; our future results of operations and financial position; industry and business trends; the remediation of material weaknesses; the impact of market conditions and other macroeconomic factors on our business, financial condition and results of operation; expectations regarding legal proceedings; our future business strategy, plans, distribution partnerships, market growth and our objectives for future operations.
The forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the important factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.
You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change. Additionally, certain information we may disclose (either herein or elsewhere) is informed by the expectations of various stakeholders or third-party frameworks and, as such, may not necessarily be material for purposes of our filings under U.S. federal securities laws, even if we use “material” or similar language in discussing such matters.
GENERAL

(“OTI”) (formerly known as Ouster, Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger of OTI with Colonnade Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“CLA”) (the “Colonnade Merger”), and to Ouster, Inc.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
•
Our products are frequently used in applications that are subject to evolving regulations and standards.
•
Our

limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.
•
We have incurred significant losses to date and may never achieve or sustain profitability. If we are unable to overcome our limited sales history and establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among customers in our target markets or if our revenue opportunity does not materialize into sales and revenue, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially.
•
Our revenue and margins could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain competitive average selling prices, high sales volumes, and/or fail to reduce product costs. 
•
We are subject to the risk of cancellation or postponement of our contracts with customers or the unsuccessful implementation of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
•
We currently target many customers that are large corporations with substantial negotiating power and exacting product standards. If we are unable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects and results of operations will be adversely affected.
•
We compete against established market participants that have substantially greater resources than us and against known and unknown market entrants who may disrupt our target markets. If our products are not selected for inclusion in our target markets, our business will be materially and adversely affected.
•
Market adoption of lidar remains uncertain, and it is difficult to forecast long-term end-customer adoption rates and demand for our products.
•
Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide and could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.
•
If we choose to acquire or invest in other new businesses, products, or technologies, such acquisitions or investments may not be completed or result in the anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated and adversely impact our business. 
•
Key components in our products come from limited or single source third-party suppliers, and we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture a significant portion of our products for the foreseeable future. Interruptions in our relationships with these third parties could adversely impact our business.
•
We may require additional capital in order to execute our business plan, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
•
We may not be able to adequately protect or 
enforce
 our intellectual property rights or prevent competitors or other unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our technology.
