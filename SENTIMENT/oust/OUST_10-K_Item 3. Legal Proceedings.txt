Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Ouster’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Ouster was founded in 2015 with the invention of our high-performance digital lidar.
 To continue to grow our bus
iness in the coming years, we expanded and plan to continue invest in growing our digital lidar product portfolio, increasing the capabilities of our software solutions, and opportunistically expanding our sales and marketing efforts. We are headquartered in San Francisco, California.
We are a leading global provider of lidar sensors and solutions. We design and manufacture high-resolution digital lidar sensors that offer advanced 3D vision to machinery, vehicles, robots, and fixed infrastructure assets, which allows each to understand and visualize the surrounding world and enable safe operation and autonomy. We believe our sensors are one of the highest-performing, lowest-cost lidar solutions available today across each of our four target markets: automotive, industrial, robotics, and smart infrastructure. Our digital lidar sensors leverage a simplified architecture based on two semiconductor chips and are backed by a suite of patent-protected technology.

We also provide perception software platforms for smart infrastructure deployments. Our software enables real-time people and object detection, classification, and tracking for actionable, intuitive, and customizable insights while preserving personally identifiable information. Our digital lidar sensors leverage a simplified architecture based on two semiconductor chips and are backed by a suite of patent-protected technology.
Our hardware product offering currently includes four models of sensors in our OS product line: the hemispheric field of view OSDome, the ultra-wide field of view OS0, the mid-range OS1, and the long-range OS2. Within our OS sensor models, we offer numerous customization options, all enabled by embedded software. For each of our models in the OS product line, we offer resolution options of 128 lines vertically (“channels”), 64 channels, or 32 channels, as well as many beam spacing options. In 2022, we launched our REV7 OS series scanning sensors powered by L3 chip. REV7 features the all-new OSDome sensor, as well as upgraded OS0, OS1, and OS2 sensors that deliver double the range, enhanced object detection, increased precision and accuracy, and greater reliability compared to our prior generation sensors. We are currently developing our solid-state digital flash (“DF”) sensors, which is a suite of short, mid, and long-range solid-state digital lidar sensors that provide uniform precision imaging without motion blur across an entire field of view.
We also provide perception software platforms for smart infrastructure deployments. Our software enables real-time people and object detection, classification, and tracking for actionable, intuitive, and customizable insights while preserving personally identifiable information. Ouster Gemini is a perception platform designed for smart infrastructure deployments like security and crowd analytics, and is optimized exclusively for Ouster’s digital lidar sensors. BlueCity is a Gemini-powered solution for traffic operations, planning, and safety. BlueCity provides real-time data analytics and predictions, which can be used to improve traffic and crowd flow efficiency, improve urban planning, advance sustainability, and protect vulnerable road users in a wide range of weather and lighting conditions.
We have invested heavily in patents since our inception, pursuing comprehensive coverage of invention families and use cases, with broad international coverage. We believe that our extensive patent coverage creates material barriers to entry for anyone aiming to compete in the digital lidar space.
We believe the simplicity of our digital lidar design gives us a meaningful advantage in costs related to manufacturing, supply chain, and production yields. Our main manufacturing partners are Benchmark and Fabrinet, which manufacture the majority of our products at their facilities in Thailand. We expect this will allow us to continue to reduce our product costs and  rapidly scale production to meet our anticipated product demand. Based on cost quotes for our products in mass production, we anticipate our manufacturing costs per unit will decrease further as production volumes increase.
Merger with Velodyne Lidar, Inc.
On November 4, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Velodyne Merger Agreement”) with Velodyne Lidar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Velodyne”), Oban Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and one of our direct, wholly owned subsidiaries (“Velodyne Merger Sub I”) and Oban Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and one of our direct, wholly owned subsidiaries (“Velodyne Merger Sub II”). On February 10, 2023, we completed our merger of equals with Velodyne pursuant to the terms of the Velodyne Merger Agreement with Velodyne, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II (the “Velodyne Merger”).
The product offerings we acquired through the Velodyne Merger include the VLP-16, VLP-16 Lite, VLP-16 Hi-Res, VLP-32 and VLS-128. These product offerings are in the final stages of their product life cycle and we plan to discontinue manufacturing them in 2025.
Amazon 
Warrant
Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), holds a warrant (“Amazon Warrant”) to acquire shares of our common stock. We assumed the Amazon Warrant as part of the Velodyne Merger. As a result of the issuance and sale by us of an additional 6,045,428

shares of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2024 pursuant to the At-Market-Issuance Sales Agreement at prices below the exercise price of the Amazon Warrant, an antidilution adjustment to the terms of the Amazon Warrant occurred, resulting in the increase in the number of shares issuable under the Amazon Warrant by 3,374 shares of common stock and a reduction to the original strike price of the Amazon Warrant to $50.64 per share. As of December 31, 2024, there were 3,267,890 shares of common stock issuable under the Amazon Warrant. The exercise price and the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the Amazon Warrant are subject to further antidilution adjustments, including in the event we make certain sales of common stock (or securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock) at a price less than the exercise price of the Amazon Warrant. The Amazon Warrant is subject to vesting; 50% of the unvested Amazon Warrant as of the date of the Velodyne Merger vested as a result of the Velodyne Merger and the remainder will vest over time based on payments by Amazon or its affiliates to us in connection with Amazon’s purchase of goods and services from us.

Factors Affecting Our Performance
Commercialization of Lidar Applications. 
We believe that our lidar solutions are approaching an inflection point of adoption across our target end market applications, and that we are well-positioned to capitalize on this market adoption. However, as our customers continue research and development projects that rely on lidar technology, it is difficult to estimate the timing of ultimate end market and customer adoption. As a result, we expect that our results of operations, including revenue and gross margins, will improve over time but may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future. As the market for lidar solutions matures and more customers reach a commercialization phase with solutions that rely on our technology, the fluctuations in our operating results may become less pronounced. In 2025, our strategic business objectives include growing the software-attached business, transforming the product portfolio, and executing towards profitability.
Number of Customers in Production. 
For certain strategic customers and markets, our products must be integrated into a broader platform, which then must be tested and validated to achieve system-level performance and reliability thresholds that enable commercial production and sales. The time necessary to reach commercial production varies from six months to several years, based on the market and application. For example, the production cycle in the automotive market tends to be substantially longer than in our other target markets. It is critical to our future success in each of our target end markets that our customers reach commercial production and select our products in their commercial production applications, and that we avoid unexpected cancellations of major purchases of our products. Because the timelines to reach production vary significantly and the revenue generated by each customer in connection with commercial production 

is unpredictable, it is difficult for us to reliably predict our financial performance.
Customers’ Sales Volumes.
 Our customer base is diversified and we aim to continue to penetrate into diverse end markets to increase our sales volumes. Ultimately, widespread adoption of our customers’ products that incorporate our lidar solutions will depend on many factors, including the size of our customers’ end markets, market penetration of our customers’ products that incorporate our digital lidar solutions, our customers’ ability to sell their products, and the financial stability and reputation of our customers.
Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”), Product Costs and Margins. 
Our product costs and gross margins depend largely on the volumes of sensors shipped, the mix of existing and new products sold and the number and variety of solutions we provide to our customers. We expect that our selling prices will vary by target end market and application due to market-specific supply and demand dynamics. We expect to continue to experience some downward pressure on prices from signing anticipated large multi-year agreements in the near term with multi-year negotiated pricing. We expect that these customer-specific selling price fluctuations combined with our volume-driven product costs may drive fluctuations in revenue and gross margins on a quarterly basis. However, notwithstanding any short-term price surcharges on our components, we expect that our volume-driven product costs will decrease over time. In addition, we expect that the current uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade relationships may impact our future product costs and margins, particularly to the extent there are significant tariffs or trade restrictions imposed on goods imported from Thailand, Canada, or China that are used in our products. These costs could also impact customer demand as described above under “Customers’ Sales Volumes.”
Competition.
 Lidar is an emerging technology, and there are many competitors for this growing market which has created downward pressure on our ASPs. Absent the introduction of new technology, we expect this pressure to continue to push our ASPs lower in the coming years. However, we believe that because of the simplicity of our digital lidar technology, we are well-positioned to scale more effectively than our competitors and can leverage this scale to deliver positive gross margins.
Continued Investment and Innovation. 
We believe that we are a leading lidar provider. Our financial performance is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain this leading position which is further dependent on the investments we make in research and development. We believe it is essential that we continue to identify and respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements, including successfully progressing our digital lidar roadmap and developing technologies that will enhance the operating performance of our products. Our “L4” sensor prototypes are generating rich point clouds and have moved into validation testing. Our “Chronos” chip has been fabricated by our foundry partner and is now undergoing in-house testing. If we fail to continue our innovation, our market position and revenue may be adversely affected, and our investments in that area will not be recovered.

Supply Chain Continuity. 
Some of the key components in the products we have designed or are currently designing come from limited or single source suppliers. If these third parties experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity or other difficulties, or experience shortages in required components, or if they are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these components in required volumes or at all, our supply may be disrupted or be on less favorable terms. For example, we may be required to seek alternate manufacturers or suppliers for our products. It would be time-consuming, and could be costly and impracticable, to begin to use and qualify new manufacturers, components or designs, and such changes could cause significant interruptions in supply and could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries and may subsequently lead to the loss of sales.
Market Trends and Uncertainties.
 We anticipate increasing demand for our digital lidar solution. We estimate a multi-billion dollar total addressable market (“TAM”) for our solutions in the future. We define our TAM as applications in the automotive, industrial, robotics, and smart infrastructure end markets where we actively engage and maintain customer relationships. Each of our target markets is potentially a significant global opportunity, and these markets have historically been underserved by limited or inferior technology or not served at all. We believe we are well positioned in our market as a leading provider of high-resolution lidar sensors.
We may not be able to take advantage of demand if we are unable to anticipate regulatory changes and adapt quickly enough to meet such new regulatory standards or requirements applicable to us or to our customers’ products in which our lidar sensors are used. Market acceptance of lidar technology and active safety technology depend upon many factors, including cost, performance, safety performance, regulatory requirements and international taxes or tariffs related to such technologies. These factors may impact the ultimate market acceptance of our lidar technology.
International Expansion.
 We view international expansion as an important element of our strategy to increase revenue and achieve profitability. We continue to position ourselves in geographic markets that we expect to serve as important sources of future growth. We have an existing presence in three regions: Americas; Asia and Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa. We intend to expand our presence in these regions over time including through distribution partnerships. Expanded global reach will require continued investment and may expose us to additional foreign currency risk, international taxes and tariffs, legal obligations, export/import regulations and additional operational costs. These risks and challenges that may impact our ability to meet our projected sales volumes, revenues, and gross margins. In addition, the current uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade relationships may impact our future international sales, particularly to the extent there are significant tariffs or trade restrictions imposed on goods imported from the United States.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
The majority of our revenue comes from the sale of our lidar sensors and accessories both directly to end users and through distributors both domestically and internationally. We recognize revenue from product sales when the performance obligation of transferring control of the product to the customer has been met, generally when the product is shipped. We also recognize revenue by performing services related to product development, validation, licenses, maintenance under our extended warranty contracts, and shipping. We do not expect these services to be material components of revenue, cost of revenue or gross margin in the near future. Performance obligations related to services are generally recognized over time, based on cost-to-cost input basis or straight-line over time. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost of shipping activities that occur after control has transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost rather than a separate performance obligation. All related costs are accrued and recognized within cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized.
Most of our customers are innovators and early technology adopters incorporating our products into their solutions. Currently, our product revenue consists of both customers ordering small volumes of our products that are in an evaluation phase and customers that order larger volumes of our products and have more predictable long-term production schedules. However, we believe we are still at the very beginning of the lidar adoption curve, and some customers are still learning their growth and demand rates which can impact the timing of purchase orders quarter to quarter. As we grow our business, we expect to continue to improve our own understanding of our customers’ needs and timelines, and expect the timing of orders will have a less notable impact on our quarterly results.

Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of the manufacturing cost of our lidar sensors, which primarily consists of sensor components, personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation directly associated with our manufacturing organization, and amounts paid to our third-party contract manufacturer and vendors. Our cost of revenue also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, amortization of intangible assets, an allocated portion of overhead, facility and IT costs, warranty expenses, excess and obsolete inventory and shipping costs.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Our gross profit equals total revenues less our total cost of revenues, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margin is subject to quarterly fluctuations in product mix, price and volume.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (“R&D”) activities are primarily conducted at our San Francisco headquarters and our additional R&D facilities in Scotland and Canada and consist of the following activities:
•
Design, prototyping, and testing of proprietary electrical, optical, and mechanical subsystems for our digital lidar products;
•
Robust testing for safety certifications;
•
Development of new products and enhancements to existing products in response to customer requirements including firmware and software development of lidar integration products;
•
Custom SoC design for Ouster’s digital lidar products; and
•
Development of custom manufacturing equipment.
R&D expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for all personnel directly involved in R&D activities, third-party engineering and contractor costs, prototype expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and an allocated portion of overhead, facility and information technology (“IT”) costs that support R&D activities.
R&D costs are expensed as they are incurred. Our investment in R&D will continue to grow as we invest in new lidar technology and related software. Our absolute amount of R&D expenses is expected to grow over time; however, we expect R&D as a percentage of revenue to decrease as our business grows.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Our business development, customer support and marketing teams are located in offices worldwide. Selling and marketing expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for all personnel directly involved in business development, customer support, and marketing activities, and marketing expenses including trade shows, advertising, and demonstration equipment. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization expense of intangible assets related to customer relationships associated with the acquisitions and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs that support sales and marketing activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time as our business grows.
47
Table of C
ontents
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, of our executives and members of the board of directors, finance, human resources, an allocated portion of facility and IT costs that support general and administrative activities, as well as amortization of intangible assets, fees related to legal fees, patent prosecution, accounting, finance and professional services, as well as insurance and bank fees. We have experienced and may in the near-term experience additional increases in general and administrative expenses related to legal, accounting, finance and professional services costs associated with litigation activities, hiring more personnel and consultants to support our international activities and compliance with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other SEC rules and regulations as a result of being a public company. Our absolute amount of general and administrative expenses will grow over time; however, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease as our business grows.
Goodwill Impairment Charges
In the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $166.7 million. These charges were primarily driven by the decrease in our market capitalization during the period. Our goodwill impairment analysis includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting unit to our total market capitalization. There was no addition to goodwill as of December 31, 2024, and as such, our remaining goodwill balance was nil. 
Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest income consists primarily of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. These amounts will vary based on our respective balances and market rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our debt and the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances, realized gains and losses related to sales of our available-for-sale investments and the change in fair value of the private placement warrant liability.
Income Taxes
Our income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes. Our income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in the quarter. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that some, or all, of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets, excluding specific balances due to the Velodyne Merger. The income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Our effective tax rate was (0.56)% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to our effective tax rate of (0.14)% for the prior year. Our tax expense changed during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to income tax expense from profitable foreign jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from sales of our products, and sales of common stock under our at-the market equity offering program.
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital, inventory management, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. We expect these needs to continue as we develop and grow our business.
As of December 31, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of $913.1 million and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $174.6 million. Management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our operations.
We manage our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that we believe have high credit quality and, at times, such amounts exceed federally insured limits. The failure of any bank with which we maintain a commercial relationship could cause us to lose our deposits in excess of the federally insured or protected amounts. We have experienced recurring losses from operations, and negative cash flows from operations, and we expect to continue operating at a loss and to have negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. Because we are in the growth stage of our business and operate in an emerging field of technology, we expect to continue to invest in research and development and opportunistically expand our sales and marketing teams worldwide. We may require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, or unforeseen circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In particular, current macroeconomic conditions, including elevated inflation rates and high interest rates, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
ATM Agreement
On April 29, 2022, we entered into an open market sale agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (the “ATM Agreement”), which expires three years from the May 2, 2022 Form S-3 filing date, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million under an “at the market” offering program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the ATM Agreement, we may sell the shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us but we are under no obligation to sell any of the shares. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, capital needs and determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 6,045,428 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $57.8 million under the ATM Agreement, and during the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 2,878,875 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $14.6 million.
The remaining availability under the ATM Agreement as of December 31, 2024 is approximately $58.6 million. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Prior Debt Arrangements
On October 25, 2023, we entered into the Credit Line Account Application and Agreement for Organizations and Businesses (the “Credit Agreement”) and the Addendum to Credit Line Account Application and Agreement (the “Addendum”; and the Credit Agreement as amended, modified, and/or supplemented by the Addendum, the “UBS Agreement”) by and among the Company, UBS Bank USA (the “Bank”), and UBS Financial Services Inc. The UBS Agreement provided us with a revolving credit line of up to $45.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. We initially borrowed $44.0 million, and all of the proceeds were used to refinance and terminate our prior term loan facility. 
On August 12, 2024, we repaid the $44.0 million principal amount outstanding under the UBS Agreement, along with accrued interest, and terminated all commitments and obligations thereunder. We funded the repayment of the outstanding revolving loans under the UBS Agreement with cash on hand. For additional information regarding the terms of the UBS Agreement, see Note 6. Debt
 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
.
Material Cash Requirements
We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, entered into in the normal course of business and operating leases. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 8. Leases and  Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $33.7 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $97.0 million, offset by our non-cash charges of $51.9 million primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization of $9.8 million, stock-based compensation of $40.5 million, amortization of right-of-use asset of $4.9 million and inventory write-down of $2.1 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.7 million, decrease in inventory of $4.7 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $21.3 million, an increase in accounts payable of $2.5 million, an increase in contract liabilities of $19.0 million, a decrease in operating lease liability of $6.3 million,

and a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of $28.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $137.9 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $374.1 million, impacted by our non-cash charges of $257.7 million primarily consisting of inventory write-down of $10.0 million, interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.0 million, goodwill impairment charges of $166.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $17.1 million, stock-based compensation of $57.7 million, loss on write-off of construction in-progress and right-of-use asset impairment of $1.7 million, and amortization of right-of-use asset of $4.5 million. The cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $21.5 million was primarily due to an increase in inventories of $4.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $8.5 million, an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $8.1 million.

proceeds from sales of short-term investments and purchases of short-term investments of $144.6 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $50.6 million, which was attributed primarily to the Velodyne Merger and proceeds and purchases of short-term investments.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $15.4 million, consisting primarily of $57.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Agreement, partially offset by the repayment of indebtedness of $44.0 million under the UBS Agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $15.7 million, consisting primarily of $14.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Agreement and proceeds from employee stock purchase program of $1.2 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amounts we report as assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. We recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed using a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant estimates and assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset, future cash inflows and outflows, probabilities of success, asset lives, and the appropriate discount rates. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
During the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense), net. 
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs are computed under the standard cost method, which approximates actual costs determined on a first in, first out basis. We record write-downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand. Significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. We consider marketability and product life cycle stage, product development plans, demand forecasts, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions in establishing our estimates. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs. A change in our estimates could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.
54
Table of C
ontents
We believe that the accounting policy discussed below is critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised products or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products or services. Significant judgment is applied when the Company determines the amount and timing of revenue from the intellectual property (“IP”) royalties when Company contracts with customers to license rights to its IP.
Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent, inflation risk. The following analysis provides quantitative and qualitative information regarding these risks.
Inflation Risk
General inflation in the U.S., Europe and other geographies has risen significantly in recent years. To date, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. However, we are monitoring the current inflationary environment, particularly as it may be impacted by proposed and/or newly implemented tariffs. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases, and our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $174.6 million, of which $24.7 million consisted of institutional money market funds, $56.9 million consisted of commercial paper, and $69.6 million consisted of corporate debt and U.S. government agency securities, all of which carries a degree of interest rate risk. The primary goals of our investment policy are liquidity and capital preservation. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. These investments are subject to interest rate risk, as sharp increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on their fair value. Although the fair values of these instruments can fluctuate, we believe that the short-term, highly liquid nature of these investments, and our ability to hold these instruments to maturity, reduces our risk for potential material losses. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.
On August 12, 2024, we repaid in full, with cash on hand, all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under the UBS Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we had no debt outstanding and therefore are not exposed to interest rate risk with respect to debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Asia and Europe. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. No strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations and our currency exchange rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if such rates move materially differently from our expectations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ouster, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ouster, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Product revenue
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue was $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, of which the majority related to product revenue. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally occurring upon shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products to the customer. 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for product revenue is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures over the Company’s revenue recognition. As disclosed by management, material weaknesses were identified that impacted this matter. 
57
Table of C
ontents
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others (i) testing revenue recognized for a sample of product revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, sales quotes, purchase orders, sales orders, invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2024 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, sales quotes, purchase orders, sales orders, invoices, and subsequent cash receipts.

OUSTER, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – 
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of Business
Ouster, Inc. was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on June 4, 2020 as “Colonnade Acquisition Corp.” (“CLA”). Following the closing of the business combination in March 2021, the Company domesticated as a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “Ouster, Inc.” The Company’s prior operating subsidiary, Ouster Technologies, Inc. (“OTI” and prior to the Merger (as defined below)), was incorporated in the state of Delaware on June 30, 2015. The Company is a leading provider of high-resolution digital lidar sensors that offer advanced 3D vision to machinery, vehicles, robots, and fixed infrastructure assets, allowing each to understand and visualize the surrounding world and ultimately enabling safe operation and ubiquitous autonomy. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this subsection to “the Company” refer to the business and operations of OTI (formerly known as Ouster, Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Merger (as defined below) and to Ouster, Inc. (formerly known as CLA) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the consummation of the Merger.
CLA, the Company’s legal predecessor, was originally a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on June 4, 2020. CLA was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On March 11, 2021, CLA consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with OTI pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of December 21, 2020. As a result of the Merger, among a number of other things, (1) each of the then issued and outstanding 
10,000,000
 redeemable warrants of CLA (the “CLA warrants”) converted automatically into a redeemable warrant to purchase 
one
 share of Ouster common stock (the “Public warrants”) pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated August 20, 2020 (the “Warrant Agreement”), between CLA and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), as warrant agent and (2) each of the then issued and outstanding 
6,000,000
 private placement warrants of CLA (the “Private Placement warrants”) converted automatically into a Public warrant pursuant to the Warrant Agreement. 
No
 fractional Public warrants were issued upon separation of the CLA units. 
On February 10, 2023, the Company completed a merger with Velodyne Lidar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Velodyne”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Velodyne Merger Agreement”) with Velodyne, Oban Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub I”) and Oban Merger Sub II LLC (“Merger Sub II”) (the “Velodyne Merger”) dated as of November 4, 2022, accounted for as a business combination with the Company being the accounting acquirer (Note 3).
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned) and have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The presentation of certain prior period amounts has been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
On April 6, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a one-for-10 reverse stock split and a corresponding reduction in authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). On April 20, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect the one-for-10 Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s common stock and a corresponding reduction in authorized shares of common stock. The par value of the Company’s common stock was not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All share and per share amounts and related stockholders’ equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
Liquidity
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from sales of the Company’s products, sales of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program and debt financing.
63
Table of Contents
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has experienced recurring losses from operations, and negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s existing sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $
174.6
 million. The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations for several years. If the Company continues to incur losses in the future, it may need to improve liquidity and raise additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to raise such capital. However, management believes that the Company’s existing sources of liquidity are adequate to fund its operations for at least twelve months from the date the consolidated financial statements were available for issuance.
Merger Agreement with Velodyne Lidar, Inc.
On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Velodyne Merger Agreement”) with Velodyne Lidar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Velodyne”), Oban Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and one of the Company’s direct, wholly owned subsidiaries (“Velodyne Merger Sub I”) and Oban Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and one of the Company’s direct, wholly owned subsidiaries (“Velodyne Merger Sub II”). 
On February 10, 2023, the Company completed the merger with Velodyne Lidar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Velodyne”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Velodyne Merger Agreement”) with Velodyne, Oban Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub I”) and Oban Merger Sub II LLC (“Merger Sub II”) (the “Velodyne Merger”) dated as of November 4, 2022, accounted for as a business combination with the Company being an accounting acquiror (Note 3).
At the Market Issuance Sales Agreement
On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into an At-Market-Issuance Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to the agents, acting as agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $
150.0
 million under the Company’s Form S-3 registration statement. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold 
6,045,428
 and 
2,878,875
 shares, respectively. The weighted-average sales price and gross proceeds to the Company before deducting offering costs, sales commissions and fees were approximately $
9.64
 and $
5.67
 per share and $
58.3
 million and $
16.3
 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the ATM Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The remaining availability under the ATM Agreement as of December 31, 2024 is approximately $
58.6
 million.
Note 2 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The most significant estimates included in these consolidated financial statements are the useful lives of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, inventory write downs, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the measurement of stock-based compensation, and the valuation of the Company’s various financial instruments. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the use of the estimates affect the amount of revenue and related expenses reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Internal and external factors can affect the Company’s estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
64
Table of Contents
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. The Company recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company assesses the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed using a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant estimates and assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset, future cash inflows and outflows, probabilities of success, asset lives, and the appropriate discount rates. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
During the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense), net.

Foreign Currencies
The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is generally the same as the entity’s local currency. Accordingly, the asset and liability accounts of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and equity accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using historical rates. The revenues and expenses are translated using the weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period, and gains and losses from foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Segment Information
The Company operates as 
one
 reportable and operating segment, which relates to the sale and production of lidar sensor kits. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. The profitability of the Company’s product group is not a determining factor in allocating resources and the CODM does not evaluate profitability below the level of the consolidated company.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised products or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products or services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, the Company performs the following five steps:
1) Identify the contract with a customer
A contract with a customer exists when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the product or services to be transferred and the payment terms for the product or services can be identified, it is determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgement in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. Accounts receivable are due under normal trade terms, typically three months or less.
2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the product or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
65
Table of Contents
3) Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring product or services to the customer. Royalties from the license of intellectual property (“IP”) are included in the transaction price in the period the sales occur. Other forms of variable consideration are included in the transaction price if the Company judges that it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component. All taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a specific revenue-producing transaction collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from the transaction price.
4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). In 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have a material volume of contracts that required the allocation of transaction price to multiple performance obligations.
5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to a customer.
Product revenue
The majority of the Company’s revenue comes from product sales of lidar sensors to direct customers and distributors. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally occurring upon shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract. Product sales to certain customers may require customer acceptance due to performance acceptance criteria that are considered more than a formality. For these product sales, revenue is recognized upon the expiration of the customer acceptance period. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, and the Company has elected to recognize the cost of shipping activities that occur after control has transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost rather than a separate performance obligation. All related shipping costs are accrued and recognized within cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized.
Services
The Company’s services revenue consists primarily of software development and compliance services. The obligation to provide services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as the Company satisfies its performance obligations. For product development and validation service projects, the Company bills and recognizes revenue as the services are performed. For these arrangements, control is transferred over as the Company’s inputs are incurred to complete the project; therefore, revenue is recognized over the service period with the measure of progress using the input method based on labor costs incurred to total labor cost (“cost-to-cost”) as the services are provided.
IP Licenses
The Company licenses rights to its IP to certain customers and collects royalties based on customer’s product sales. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. The Company recognizes license revenue upon the later of (a) delivery of the IP or (b) commencement of the license term if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Revenue for licenses to future technology developed on a when-and-if -available basis is recognized straight-line over the license period as long as customers continue to have access to the future technology. Royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated.
Software Licenses
The Company’s Gemini software license arrangements provide the customer with the right to install and use functional intellectual property (as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted) for the duration of the contract term (perpetual or term license). Revenue from distinct software licenses is recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.
66
Table of Contents
Maintenance
The Company’s Gemini software license arrangements typically include an initial (bundled) post contract customer support (maintenance or “PCS”) term. Those software license arrangements, which include PCS represent a distinct, stand-alone performance obligation. Contract consideration is allocated to the PCS based on its relative SSP and revenue is recognized ratably over the PCS term.
Product Warranties
The Company provides standard product warranties for a term of typically 
one
 to 
two years
 to ensure that its products comply with agreed-upon specifications. Standard warranties are considered to be assurance type warranties and are not accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company also provides service type extended warranties for typically an additional term ranging up to 
two
 additional years. For service type extended warranty contracts, the Company allocates revenue to this performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis and recognizes the revenue on a ratable basis over time during the effective period of the services as the Company stands ready to provide services as needed.
Costs to obtain a contract
The Company expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period for these costs would typically be less than one year. These costs primarily relate to sales commissions and are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The incremental cost of obtaining a contract for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
4.1
 million and $
5.0
 million, respectively.
Right of return
The Company’s general terms and conditions for its contracts do not contain a right of return that allows the customer to return products and receive a credit, however it has in practice permitted returns of its sensor kits in limited circumstances. Allowances for sales returns, which reduce revenue, are estimated using historical experience and were immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Actual returns in subsequent periods have been consistent with estimated amounts.
Net loss per common share
The Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share. The two-class method determines net loss per common share for common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company has no participating securities outstanding for the periods presented.
Basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net loss attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.
In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
 The Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s changes in unrealized loss on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustment are the only components of other comprehensive loss that is excluded from the reported net loss for all periods presented.
67
Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash deposited with banks, money market accounts and commercial paper.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit held by banks as security for outstanding letters of credit.
Investments
The Company considers investments with an original maturity greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year to be short-term investments. The Company classifies those investments that are not required for use in current operations and that mature in more than 12 months as long-term investments.
The Company classifies its investments as available for sale and reports them at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. For investments sold prior to maturity, the cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses representing its best estimate of expected credit losses related to its existing accounts receivable and their net realizable value. The allowance is determined using a combination of factors including historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and customers’ financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. The Company writes off accounts receivable against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Changes in the Company’s allowance for expected credit losses were as follows (in thousands):

Inventory
Inventory consists primarily of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs are computed under the standard cost method, which approximates actual costs determined on the first-in, first-out basis. The Company charges cost of revenue for write-downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand based on purchase commitments, production needed to fulfil the warranty obligations, consideration of product marketability and product development plans, historical revenue and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of income. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (see Note 5).
68
Table of Contents
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company records an impairment charge in the period in which such determination is made. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment or when a change in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of the goodwill may be below the carrying value.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Examples of such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal or business climate, an adverse regulatory action or unanticipated competition. The Company has determined that it operates in a single operating segment and has a single reporting unit.
Prior to performing the impairment test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company were to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the Company would perform a quantitative impairment test.
The quantitative impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit. In connection with the Company’s goodwill impairment assessments during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company impaired all of its goodwill.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of developed technology, vendor relationship and customer relationships. Acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at the acquisition-date fair value. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally 
3
 to 
8
 years.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting standard whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements. Fair value is defined in the accounting standard as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
•
Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.

Table of Contents
Warrant Liabilities
Warrant liabilities consist of Private Placement warrants. The Private Placement warrants are not redeemable for cash so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees but may be redeemable for common stock if certain other conditions are met. If the Private Placement warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders subject to certain conditions, such as the reported closing price of our common stock equaling or exceeding $
180.00
 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
 trading-day period ending 
three
 business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the holders of Private Placement warrants. The Company evaluated the Private Placement warrants and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified within stockholders’ equity. The agreement governing the Private Placement warrants includes a provision, the application of which could result in a different settlement value for the Private Placement warrants depending on their holder. Because the holder of an instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s ordinary shares, the Private Placement warrants are not considered to be “indexed to the Company’s own stock.” This provision precludes the Company from classifying the Private Placement warrants in stockholders’ equity. 
As the Private Placement warrants meet the definition of a derivative, the Company recorded these warrants as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting date.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments with financial institutions that Company believes are of high credit quality, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash with financial institutions in the U.S. of $
161.8
 million and $
184.8
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also had cash with financial institutions in countries other than the U.S. of approximately $
12.8
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively, that was not federally insured.
The Company generally does not require collateral or other security deposits for accounts receivable.
To reduce credit risk, the Company considers customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts. Past due balances over 
90
 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.
Accounts receivable from the Company’s major customers representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable and unbilled receivable was as follows:

Amazon Warrant
The Amazon Warrant (as defined in Note 7) is accounted for as an equity instrument. To determine the fair value of the Amazon Warrant on its issuance date, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
For awards granted to a customer, which are not in exchange for distinct goods or services, the fair value of the awards earned based on service or performance conditions is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Accordingly, when Amazon purchases goods or services and vesting conditions become probable of being achieved, the Company records a non-cash stock-based reduction to revenue associated with the Amazon Warrant, which is calculated based on the fair value of the Amazon Warrant shares as of the Velodyne Merger date.
Stock-based compensation
The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, and consultants over the requisite service periods based on the estimated grant date fair value, which for options is using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model using the following variables:
•
Common Stock Valuation
 – The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the Company’s stock-based awards issued after the Colonnade Merger is based on the grant date closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Before closing of the Colonnade Merger, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the Company’s stock-based awards was historically determined by management and approved by the board of directors. Because there was no public market for the Company’s common stock, the board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including contemporaneous valuations performed by an unrelated third-party specialist, valuations of comparable public companies, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of capital stock, and general and industry-specific economic outlook. Valuations performed by the third-party valuation specialist used methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (“AICPA” Accounting and Valuation Guide). In relation to options, the Board intends all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of the common stock underlying those options on the date of grant.
•
Expected Term
 – The expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method, which deems the term to be the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options.
•
Expected Volatility
 – The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected term of the awards for a peer group of comparable companies with publicly traded shares.
•
Expected Dividends
 – The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the expected dividend yield is 
0
%.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate 
– The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant.
The fair values of the restricted stock awards and restricted stock units were determined based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The Company’s policy for issuing stock upon stock option exercise is to issue new common stock.
Income taxes
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to its history of operating losses, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any.  An uncertain tax position that meets a more likely than not standard based on its technical merit would then be evaluated under the measurement step to determine the largest tax benefit that the taxpayer 
71
Table of Contents
more likely than not will realize. The Company classifies any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). The ASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the amendments in this update for the annual period beginning fiscal year 2024 and retrospectively applied to all periods presented. Refer to Note 16 regarding the additional disclosures included within the consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not referenced below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of additional information for reconciling items meeting certain quantitative thresholds, requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, and modifies certain other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and can be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied prospectively, with the option for retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.

Business Combination and Related Transactions 
On February 10, 2023, the Company completed the Velodyne Merger. Velodyne shares ceased trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC after market close on February 10, 2023, and each Velodyne share was exchanged for 
0.8204
 shares of the Company’s common stock. Velodyne is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the Company’s senior management prior to the Velodyne Merger comprising a majority of the senior management of the Company following the Velodyne Merger, the Company being the initiator of acquiring Velodyne and the Company being the party issuing shares in the Velodyne Merger. The acquisition price for the Velodyne Merger was $
306.6
 million, primarily consisting of fair value of the Company’s common stock issued in exchange for Velodyne shares and fair value of the Amazon Warrant (Note 7) of $
8.6
 million. Through December 31, 2023, transaction costs incurred by the Company in connection with the Velodyne Merger, including professional fees, were $
13.0
 million.

Developed technology relates to Velodyne’s lidar sensors and BlueCity software used to monitor traffic networks and public spaces. The Company applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the developed technology, which involved significant assumptions related to the relief-from-royalty rate, the migration curve, the discount rate, and the economic life. The Company valued the hardware developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Software developed technology was valued using the excess earnings method. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecasted period.
The estimated fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the distributor method, which involved significant assumptions related to the distributions margin. The Company estimated customer relationships useful life of 
8
 years that approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.

The estimated fair value of the inventory was determined using the comparative sales method, which estimated the expected sales price of the product, reduced by all costs expected to be incurred to complete or dispose of the inventory, as well as a profit on the sale. 
The estimated fair value of property and equipment utilized a replacement cost method incorporating the age, quality and condition of the assets.
The excess of the purchase consideration and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date over the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and the anticipated operational synergies at the time of the Velodyne Merger.
The Company’s consolidated statement of operations as of December 31, 2023, includes Velodyne revenue of $
29.0
 million for the period from the acquisition date of February 10, 2023 to December 31, 2023. Due to the integration of the combined businesses, it was impractical to determine the earnings.

Money market funds are included within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
The fair value of the Private Placement warrant liabilities is based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. In determining the fair value of the warrant liabilities, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value using unobservable inputs including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield (see Note 7).
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company has certain assets, including intangible assets, which are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are adjusted to fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. The categorization of the framework used to measure fair value of the assets is considered to be within the Level 3 valuation hierarchy due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used.
Disclosure of Fair Values
Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value includ
e accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair 
values.

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net
In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Velodyne. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination. The Company acquired Velodyne for the price of $
306.6
 million, primarily consisting of fair value of the Company’s common stock issued in exchange for Velodyne shares and fair value of the Amazon Warrant of $
8.6
 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary estimated fair values of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities acquired and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected synergies at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2023 the Company experienced a significant decline in its stock price. This decline resulted in the total market value of its shares of stock outstanding (“market capitalization”) being less than the carrying value of its reporting unit as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. The Company also considered the impact of current macroeconomic conditions in the lidar sensor industry that potentially impact the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit. The macroeconomic conditions considered include deterioration in the equity markets evidenced by sustained declines in the Company’s stock price, those of its peers, along with an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital primarily driven by an increase in interest rates. After considering all available evidence in the evaluation of goodwill impairment indicators, the Company determined it was appropriate to perform an interim quantitative assessment of its goodwill as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. In connection with the Company’s interim goodwill impairment assessments the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $
99.4
 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $
67.3
 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023. The Company’s goodwill impairment analysis included a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting unit to our total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2023, remaining goodwill balance was 
nil

Debt
Loan and Security Agreement
On April 29, 2022 the Company entered into a loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”) (as amended, the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement provided the Company with a term loan facility of up to $
50.0
 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Company borrowed the initial tranche of $
20.0
 million on April 29, 2022. On October 17, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $
20.0
 million.
The Loan Agreement included a minimum liquidity financial covenant whereby the Company was required to maintain at least 
$
60.0
 million
 of cash in deposit accounts that are subject to an account control agreement in favor of Hercules.
On February 10, 2023, the Company amended the Loan Agreement to (i) increase the existing debt baskets for (a) purchase money debt and capital leases and (b) letter of credit obligations, (ii) provide for increased flexibility to maintain cash in non-US accounts, and (iii) provide for increased flexibility to relocate certain equipment.
Advances under the Loan Agreement bore interest at the rate of interest equal to greater of either (i) (x) the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus (y) 
6.15
%, and (ii) 
9.40
%, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other conditions. The Loan Agreement included covenants, limitations, and events of default customary for similar facilities.
In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company paid the lender a cash facility and legal fees of $
0.6
 million and incurred debt issuance costs to third parties that were directly related to issuing debt in the amount of $
0.3
 million. The effective interest rate on this debt was 
17.90
% after giving effect to the debt discount, debt issuance costs and the end of term charge. Amortization expense included in the interest expense related to debt discount and debt issuance costs of the Loan Agreement was not material for the year ended December 31, 2023.
On October 25, 2023, the Loan Agreement was repaid with proceeds of the loans drawn under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) with UBS Bank USA and UBS Financial Services Inc. resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
3.6
 million and recorded it as interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

Revolving Credit
On October 25, 2023, the Company entered into the Credit Line Account Application and Agreement for Organizations and Businesses (the “Credit Agreement”) and the Addendum to Credit Line Account Application and Agreement (the “Addendum”; and the Credit Agreement as amended, modified, and/or supplemented by the Addendum, the “UBS Agreement”) by and among the Company, UBS Bank USA (the “Bank”), and UBS Financial Services Inc. The maturity date under the UBS Agreement was August 2, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”).
The UBS Agreement provided the Company with a revolving credit line of up to $
45.0
 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Company borrowed $
44.0
 million on October 25, 2023, and all of the proceeds were used to prepay and terminate the Company’s Loan Agreement on October 25, 2023. 
Pursuant to the terms of the UBS Agreement, the Company agreed to maintain minimum liquidity, that could be comprised of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents, U.S. treasuries and other assets acceptable to the Bank, of $
52.0
 million in an account maintained with the Bank or its affiliates at all times. 
Loans under the UBS Agreement bore interest at a rate equal to (x) for variable rate loans, the sum of (i) the applicable SOFR average plus 
0.110
%, plus (ii) 
1.20
%, and (y) for fixed rate loans, the sum of either (1) CME Term Rate or (2) the U.S. Treasury Rate, as applicable and as defined in the UBS Agreement, as determined based on the duration of the advance, plus the applicable liquidity premium with a range of 
0.15
% to 
0.50
%, as set forth in the UBS Agreement. Interest payments were due (x) for variable rate loans, on the last day of each calendar month, and on each date that any portion of the principal amount is due, including on the Maturity Date, and (y) for fixed rate loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period, and on each date that any portion of the principal amount is due, including on the Maturity Date. The Company was able to repay any variable rate loans at any time in whole or in part, without penalty. The Company could repay any fixed rate loans in whole, but not in part, subject to certain breakage costs. Interest expense was recognized over the life of the respective debt, which approximates the effective interest rate method.
The Company had agreed to pay an unused line fee in an amount equal to (i) the commitment amount of $
45.0
 million less the average daily balance of the sum of the principal amount of the obligations outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter, multiplied by (ii) 
0.50
% per annum, and such unused line fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter.
The UBS Agreement also contained affirmative and negative covenants customary for a credit line of this type, including requirements for maintenance of the collateral accounts and certain limitations on withdrawal of cash from such collateral accounts. The UBS Agreement also provided for customary events of default, including, among others, non-payment, failure to maintain an amount equal to the greater of (x) the outstanding loans and (y) the collateral value as determined by the Bank, in the securities accounts maintained with the Bank, bankruptcy, or breach of a covenant, representation and warranty. 
On August 12, 2024, the Company repaid in full, with cash on hand, all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under the UBS Agreement. The UBS Agreement payoff amount included the revolving loans in the principal amount of $
44.0
 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Warrants
Private Placement Warrants
Simultaneously with the closing of the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”) in August 2020, the sponsor of CLA, Colonnade Sponsor LLC, purchased an aggregate of 
6,000,000
 Private Placement warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $
6,000,000
. The Private Placement warrants became exercisable 
12
 months following the closing of the Company’s IPO, and expire 
5
 years from the completion of the Colonnade Merger, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On March 11, 2021, as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, each outstanding Private Placement warrant automatically converted into a warrant to purchase one-tenth of a share of Ouster common stock pursuant to the Warrant Agreement. Each 10 Private Placement warrants is exercisable for one share of Ouster common stock at an exercise price of $
115.00
 per share, with no fractional shares being issuable upon exercise of a warrant.
The Private Placement warrant liability was initially recognized as a liability at a fair value of $
19.4
 million and the Private Placement warrant liability was remeasured to fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, resulting in immaterial changes in fair value in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, classified within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Public Warrants
CLA, in its IPO in August 2020, issued units that each consisted of 
one
 Class A ordinary share and one-half warrant to purchase a Class A ordinary share (the “Public warrants”). The warrants became exercisable 
12
 months following the closing of the Company’s IPO, and expire 
five years
 from the completion of the Merger, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On March 11, 2021, upon the closing of the Colonnade Merger each of the 
9,999,996
 outstanding warrants, as adjusted for any fractional warrants that were not issued upon separation, was converted automatically into a redeemable Public warrant to purchase 
one
 share of the Company’s common stock. As adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, each 10 Public warrants is exercisable for one share of Ouster common stock at an exercise price of $
115.00
 per share with no fractional shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant. The Public warrants were recognized as equity upon the Merger in the amount of $
17.9
 million.
Prior to their expiration, the Company may redeem the Public warrants at a price of $
0.10
 per warrant, provided that the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $
180.00
 per share for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company gives proper notice of such redemption to the warrants holders.
The Company also assumed 
5,973,170
 outstanding public warrants upon closing the Velodyne Merger to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Velodyne Public warrants”). Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase 
0.06153
 shares of the Company’s common stock. Each 10 Velodyne Public warrants is exercisable for 0.6153 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $
140.20
 per 0.6153 share of common stock, with no fractional shares being issuable upon exercise of a warrant. The warrants are exercisable at any time and expire in September 2025. The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $
0.10
 per warrant at any time after they become exercisable, provided that the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $
219.41
 per share, subject to adjustments, for any 
20
-trading days within a 
30
-trading day period ending 
three
 business days prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. The Velodyne Public warrants were recognized as equity upon the Velodyne Merger.
Amazon Warrant
On February 10, 2023, as part of the Velodyne Merger, the Company assumed a warrant agreement and a transaction agreement, pursuant to which Velodyne agreed to issue to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”), a warrant to acquire, following customary antidilution adjustments, up to an aggregate of 
3,263,898

 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $
50.71
 per share (the “Amazon Warrant”). The exercise price and the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the Amazon Warrant are subject to further antidilution adjustments, including in the event the Company makes certain sales of common stock (or securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company’s common stock) at a price less than the exercise price of the Amazon Warrant. As a result of the issuance and sale by the Company of an additional 
6,045,428
 shares of common stock in the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 pursuant to the At-Market-Issuance Sales Agreement at prices below the exercise price of the Amazon Warrant, an antidilution adjustment was made in accordance to the terms of the Amazon Warrant occurred (see Note 11), resulting in the increase in the number of shares issuable under the Amazon Warrant by 
3,374
 shares of common stock and a reduction to the original strike price of the Amazon Warrant to $
50.64
 per share. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
3,267,890
 shares of common stock issuable under the Amazon Warrant.
81
Table of Contents
The Amazon Warrant is subject to vesting. As a result of the Velodyne Merger, 
50
% of the unvested Amazon Warrant as of the date of the Velodyne Merger have vested and the remainder will vest over time based on payments by Amazon or its affiliates to us in connection with Amazon’s purchase of goods and services from the Company. The vested portion of the Amazon Warrant, representing 
1,848,694
 shares of Ouster common stock with a fair value of $
8.6
 million, was included in the Velodyne Merger purchase price consideration on February 10, 2023.
The Amazon Warrant shares vest in multiple tranches over time based on payments of up to $
100.0
 million by Amazon or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) to the Company in connection with Amazon’s purchase of goods and services. The fair value of the unvested Amazon Warrant, representing 
1,107,586
 unvested Ouster common stock shares will be recognized as a non-cash stock-based reduction to revenue when Amazon makes payments and vesting conditions become probable of being achieved. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, 
226,691
 Amazon Warrant shares vested and the Company recognized non-cash stock-based reduction to revenue of $
0.9
 million.
The fair value of the Amazon Warrant shares was estimated on February 10, 2023, the date of completion of the Velodyne Merger, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the remaining contractual term of 
6.98
 years, an expected volatility of 
53.7
%, a 
3.86
% risk-free interest rate and a 
0
% expected dividend yield. The Company estimated expected volatility by using historical volatility of the Company’s publicly traded stock and historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies for the period commencing February 16, 2016 and ending on the date of the Merger.
The right to exercise the Amazon Warrant and receive the warrant shares that have vested expires February 4, 2030.
As of December 31, 2024, 
2,160,304
 Amazon Warrant shares have vested.

Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit
In connection with certain office leasehold interests in real property located in San Francisco (350 Treat Ave and, 2741 16th Street) and in Paris, France, the Company obtained letters of credit from certain banks as required by the lease agreements. If the Company defaults under the terms of the applicable lease, the lessor will be entitled to draw upon the letters of credit in the amount necessary to cure the default. The amounts covered by the letters of credit are collateralized by certificates of deposit, which are included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The immaterial amount collateralizing the Paris letter of credit was released in October 2024 following the expiry of the Paris lease. The outstanding amount of the letters of credit was $
1.4
 million and $
1.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Non-cancelable purchase commitments
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had non-cancelable purchase commitments to third-party contract manufacturers for approximately $
12.5
 million and other vendors for approximately $
4.4
 million.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting period as additional information becomes known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If a loss is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the loss contingency and an estimate of possible loss or range of loss (unless such an estimate cannot be made). Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
Litigation
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether any exposure is reasonably estimable. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from our current estimates.
Velodyne Legacy Litigation
On March 3, 2021, a purported shareholder of Velodyne filed a complaint for a putative class action against Velodyne, Anand Gopalan and Andrew Hamer in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, entitled 
Moradpour v. Velodyne Lidar, Inc., et al.
, No. 3:21-cv01486-SI. The complaint alleged purported violations of the federal securities laws and that, among other things, the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts about Velodyne’s business, operations and prospects, including with respect to David Hall’s role with Velodyne and removal as Chairman of Velodyne’s Board of Directors. The complaint alleged that purported class members have suffered losses and sought, among other things, an award of compensatory damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Velodyne’s securities between November 9, 2020 and February 19, 2021.

Table of Contents
On March 12, 2021, a putative class action entitled 
Reese v. Velodyne Lidar, Inc., et al.
, No. 3:21-cv-01736-VC, was filed against Velodyne, Mr. Gopalan and Mr. Hamer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, based on allegations similar to those in the earlier class action and seeking recovery on behalf of the same putative class. On March 19, 2021, another putative class action entitled 
Nick v. Velodyne Lidar, Inc., et al.
, No. 4:21-cv-01950-JST, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against Velodyne, Mr. Gopalan, Mr. Hamer, 
two
 current or former directors, and 
three
 other entities. The complaint was based on allegations similar to those in the earlier class actions and sought, among other things, an award of compensatory damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Velodyne’s securities between July 2, 2020 and March 17, 2021. The class actions have been consolidated, lead plaintiffs have been appointed and an amended consolidated complaint was filed on September 1, 2021, based on allegations similar to those in the earlier class actions. After multiple motions to dismiss, on July 1, 2022, the court denied the motion to dismiss as it relates to the claims related to David Hall’s role with Velodyne, but granted the motion to dismiss as to all other claims. On July 14, 2023, the Court granted Diane Smith’s motion for class certification. 
On March 13, 2024, the parties to the consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed a stipulation of settlement to settle this lawsuit, without any admission or concession of wrongdoing or liability by Velodyne or the individual defendants. On April 19, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement that provides for a payment of 
$
27.5
 million
, of which 
$
23.4
 million
 was funded by insurance proceeds. The Company had accrued for and recorded the entire amount of this 
$
27.5
 million
 settlement liability and had recorded the expense within general and administrative expenses in 2023 after concluding that such settlement amount is probable and reasonably estimable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an insurance receivable of 
$
23.4
 million
 in prepaid expenses and other current assets to be funded by insurance proceeds based on the terms of the settlement. The 
$
23.4
 million
 insurance receivable allows the Company to recover the majority of the settlement expense, resulting in a net charge of $
4.1
 million in its consolidated statement of operations. 
The settlement charge of $
4.1
 million was paid in June 2024. As a result of the court approving the settlement, issuing final judgment, and dismissing the lawsuit on August 19, 2024, the Company unrecognized the related liability and receivable in the amount of $
23.4
 million.
On January 18, 2022, David and Marta Hall filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, against current and former officers and directors of Velodyne, as well as Jeff Vetter, Velodyne’s outside counsel. The Halls sought to recover damages for financial and other injuries they allegedly sustained as a result of the merger between Graf and Velodyne. On May 3, 2022, certain defendants filed motions to compel arbitration and other defendants filed motions to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court conducted a hearing on the motions on July 20, 2022.  On August 30, 2022, the court granted the motion to quash service with respect to the out of state defendants. On October 3, 2022, the court granted the motion to compel Mr. Hall to arbitrate his claims, and stayed proceedings on Ms. Hall’s claims pending arbitration of Mr. Hall’s claims. On October 20, 2022, Mr. and Ms. Hall voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice. On January 3, 2023, Mr. and Ms. Hall filed an arbitration demand with substantially the same allegations as the prior lawsuit. On or about August 22, 2023, and Ms. Hall filed an application in Texas District Court, Dallas County to compel arbitration of Messrs. Graf and Dee who had been dismissed from the prior court action for lack of personal jurisdiction. Messrs. Graf and Dee agreed to participate in the arbitration and thus the Texas action has been stayed. On January 17, 2025, 
three
 of the individual respondents were dismissed with prejudice, and Mr. and Ms. Hall dismissed certain claims against the 
three
 remaining respondents Messrs. Goplan, Graf and Dee. The arbitration hearing previously set for February 3, 2025 was vacated. The parties agreed to a confidential settlement, without any admission or concession of wrongdoing or liability by Velodyne or the individual respondents, and subject to final documentation. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued the expected settlement expenses associated with this action. An insurance receivable allows the Company to recover the majority of the expected settlement expenses, resulting in a net charge that is immaterial to its consolidated statement of operations.
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs David and Marta Hall filed a complaint against Velodyne in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco asserting claims for breach of contract and failure to reimburse expenses in violation of California Labor Code Section 2802 (the “2023 Hall Matter”). The 2023 Hall Matter seeks indemnification for legal fees incurred on the Halls’ behalf in connection with a prior derivative action against certain Velodyne officers and directors, and naming Velodyne as a nominal 
defendant
, captioned In Re Velodyne Lidar, Inc. Derivative Action, Case No. 1:21-cv-00369-TMH (D. Del.) (dismissed on November 7, 2023). On November 21, 2023, Velodyne denied all allegations. The 2023 Hall Matter is set for trial on April 8, 2025. While the Company does not believe the claims are meritorious; a settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in principle by the parties.

On August 25, 2023, a putative shareholder class action suit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against 
six
 former officers and directors of Graf Acquisition LLC, the predecessor entity of Velodyne, as well as 
two
 other entities (one of which has since been dismissed without prejudice), entitled 
Berger v. Graf Acquisition, LLC, et al
., No. C.A. 2023 0873 LWW. The Company, Graf Acquisition LLC and Velodyne are not named as defendants. The plaintiff, who was allegedly a GIC shareholder, asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment in connection with the merger of GIC and Velodyne on September 29, 2020, and seeks damages, disgorgement and other recovery on behalf of the putative class of GIC shareholders in an unspecified amount. The Company is obligated to indemnify such former officers and directors under certain circumstances. The court has set trial for July 14, 2025. The Company does not believe the claims are meritorious and intends to defend the action vigorously.
Ouster Litigation
On April 11, 2023, the Company filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (the “Commission”) pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1337 (“Section 337”). The complaint requests that the Commission institute an investigation relating to the unlawful importation, sale for importation, and/or sale after importation into the United States by Hesai Group, Hesai Technology Co., Ltd., and Hesai Inc. (collectively “Hesai”) of certain LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems and/or components thereof. The complaint alleges that Hesai’s LiDAR products infringe certain claims of the Company’s U.S. Patent Nos. 11,175,405, 11,178,381, 11,190,750, 11,287,515 and/or 11,422,236. The complaint seeks the issuance of a permanent exclusion order and cease and desist order. On May 11, 2023, the Commission decided to institute an investigation based on the Company’s complaint as In the Matter of Certain LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Systems and Components Thereof, 337-TA-1363. On May 25, 2023, the Administrative Law Judge issued a procedural schedule whereby the evidentiary hearing was to begin on January 4, 2024, with a target date for completion of the Investigation by the Commission on October 17, 2024. On June 7, 2023, Hesai responded to the complaint and denied all allegations. On June 22, 2023, Hesai filed a motion to terminate or alternatively stay the investigation in light of an alleged agreement to arbitrate based on the Settlement Agreement signed in 2020 between Hesai and Velodyne (the "Settlement Agreement”). Hesai alleged that the Company is bound to the 2020 Settlement Agreement as a result of the Company’s merger with Velodyne in 2023. The Company opposed the motion, including any allegation that the Company has any obligation to arbitrate or that its patents are subject to any terms of the 2020 Settlement Agreement, which the Company never signed. On August 24, 2023, the administrative law judge (“ALJ”) issued an initial determination granting the motion to terminate, holding that a valid arbitration agreement exists as part of the Settlement Agreement, and thus arbitrators should decide whether the Company has an obligation to arbitrate. On August 31, 2023, the Company filed a petition for review of the initial determination with the Commission. On September 14, 2023, Hesai responded. On October 11, 2023, the Commission issued a notice of its determination to review and, on review, to affirm with modification the ALJ’s initial determination granting the motion to terminate the investigation in its entirety based upon the arbitration agreement. As a result, the investigation was terminated.
On April 11, 2023, the Company also filed a complaint in the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement of the same patents as in the aforementioned Section 337 proceeding against Hesai Group and Hesai Technology Co., Ltd. The complaint seeks monetary damages as well as the issuance of a permanent injunction. On May 30, 2023, the Court granted to stay the case pending the resolution, including all appeals, of In the Matter of Certain LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Systems and Components Thereof, 337-TA-1363. On February 10, 2025, the parties filed a joint request to maintain the stay.
On May 17, 2023, Hesai Photonics Technology Co. Ltd. and Hesai Group (collectively “Hesai Photonics”) filed a request for arbitration with JAMS against the Company, Velodyne Lidar, Inc., Velodyne, LLC, and Oban Merger Sub II LLC. Hesai Photonics alleges that the Company is bound by the terms and conditions, including an obligation to arbitrate disputes, of a Settlement Agreement signed in 2020 between Hesai Photonics and Velodyne Lidar, Inc. as a result of the Company’s 2023 merger with Velodyne Lidar, Inc. On June 13, 2023, the Company responded to the arbitration demand. The Company denied all allegations. The Company also disputed that there was an obligation to arbitrate, and thus, alleged that JAMS lacked jurisdiction. The arbitration hearing was held on November 18-19, 2024, and the Company awaits a decision.

On September 14, September 25, and September 26, 2023, Hesai filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) challenging the validity of the Company’s patents asserted in the ITC and Delaware patent actions. The Company provided preliminary responses to those petitions in late December 2023 and early January 2024. On March 19, 2024, March 28, 2024, and April 1, 2024 the PTAB issued decisions to institute inter partes review for four patents: IPR2023-01421 (Patent No. 11,175,405), hearing date of December 17, 2024; IPR2023-01422 (Patent No. 11,287,515), hearing date of December 17, 2024; IPR2023-01456 (Patent No. 11,178,381), hearing date of January 13, 2025; and IPR2023-01457 (Patent No. 11,190,750), hearing date of January 13, 2025.  On March 13, 2025, the PTAB issued final written decisions upholding the patentability of all challenged claims in IPR2023-01422, and finding unpatentable all challenged claims in IPR2023-01421 and IPR2023-01457.  On March 17, 2025, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding unpatentable all challenged clams of IPR2023-01456.  Regarding the fifth patent (Patent No. 11,422,236), the PTAB declined to institute on March 28, 2024 (see IPR2023-01458). Hesai requested review to the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“Director Review”), who remanded to the PTAB for further review of its decision not to institute. On January 21, 2025, the PTAB again denied institution, to which Hesai again requested Director Review, and the Company objected. The parties are awaiting decision on whether Director Review will occur.
Indemnification
From time to time, the Company enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business that include indemnification provisions. Generally, in these provisions the Company agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the indemnified parties for claims and losses suffered or incurred by such indemnified parties for which the Company is responsible under the applicable indemnification provisions. The terms of the indemnification provisions vary depending upon negotiations between the Company and its counterpart; however, typically, these indemnification obligations survive the term of the contract and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make pursuant to these provisions are uncapped. 
The Company has also entered into indemnity agreements pursuant to which it has indemnified its directors and officers, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual. To date, the Company is indemnifying and has incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims described above under the heading “Litigation” pursuant to the indemnity agreements of former directors and officers.

Stock-based Compensation
As of December 31, 2024, the Company maintains 
five
 equity incentive plans: its Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”), the Sense Photonics, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Sense Plan”), the Velodyne Lidar, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Velodyne Plan”), its 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and its Amended and Restated 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2022 ESPP” and, collectively with the 2015 Plan, the Sense Plan, the Velodyne Plan and the 2021 Plan, the “Plans”).
87
Table of Contents
The Plans, other than the 2022 ESPP, provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock unit awards and other forms of equity compensation (collectively, “equity awards”). In addition, the 2021 Plan provides for the grant of performance bonus awards. New equity awards may only be granted under the 2021 Plan and Velodyne Plan.

Awards under the 2021 Plan and Velodyne Plan can be granted to employees, including officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case, within the limits provided in the 2021 Plan and Velodyne Plan, respectively.
Options under the Plans will be exercisable at such times and as specified in the Award Agreement (as defined in the Plans) provided that the term of an option or stock appreciation will not exceed 
ten years
. Options granted under the Plans may be Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) or Non-statutory Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator (as defined in the Plans) at the time of grant of an option and subject to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The exercise price of an option will be no less than 
100
% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of an ISO granted to a 
10
% shareholder will be no less than 
110
% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and the term of the ISO will not exceed 
five years
. Options granted generally vest over 
four years
 and vest at a rate of 
25
% upon the first anniversary of the issuance date and 1/36th per month thereafter. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest as to 
25
% of the shares on the first anniversary service date of the grant, and quarterly thereafter so as to be 
100
% vested on the fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. All participants holding shares of restricted stock will be entitled to all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares and have voting power and other rights with respect to such shares, provided, however, that such shares are held in escrow and subject to forfeiture until the shares vested.
Certain employees have the right to early exercise unvested stock options, subject to rights held by the Company to repurchase unvested shares in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination. The Company accounts for cash received in consideration for the early exercise of unvested stock options as a non-current liability, included as a component of other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
2021 Incentive Award Plan
On March 11, 2021, the board of directors approved the 2021 Plan. 
18,558,576
 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan includes an evergreen provision that provides for an annual increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance thereunder beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on January 1, 2031, equal to 
5
% of the shares of Company common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and such smaller number of shares as determined by the board of directors or a committee thereof. 
2015 Stock Plan 
In 2015, the Company established its 2015 Stock Plan. As of March 11, 2021, the effective time of the Colonnade Merger, the Company no longer grants equity awards pursuant to the 2015 Plan, but it continues to govern the terms of outstanding stock options that were granted prior to that date.
2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company’s 2022 ESPP has been offered to all eligible employees since August 2022 and generally permits certain employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of their compensation of each offering period, subject to certain limitations. 
The 2022 ESPP provides offering periods that have a duration of 
24
 months in length and are comprised of purchase periods of 
six months
 in length. The offering periods are scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after May 16 and November 16 of each year. Under the 2022 ESPP, the purchase price of a share equals 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of a share of common stock on either the first or last day of the applicable offering period of the last day of the applicable purchase period. 
88
Table of Contents
In May of 2023, the Company increased the share purchase limit under the 2022 ESPP to 
3,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock per offering period and added Velodyne Lidar, Inc. as a participating employer in the 2022 ESPP. The stock-based compensation expense for the 2022 ESPP is based on the estimated grant date fair value utilizing the Black-Scholes option valuation model of the 2022 ESPP shares and the number of shares that can be purchased as of the grant date, which is recognized as expense on a straight-line expense attribution method over the length of an offering period. During fiscal 2024 employees purchased 
384,341
 shares of common stock under the 2022 ESPP at a weighted-average purchase price of $
4.43
, with proceeds of $
1.7
 million. During fiscal 2023 employees purchased 
257,506
 shares of common stock under the 2022 ESPP at a weighted-average purchase price of $
4.56
, with proceeds of $
1.2
 million.
Equity Plans Assumed from Acquisition
On October 22, 2021 (“Effective Time”), the Company closed the acquisition of Sense pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (“Sense Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sense Agreement, upon the completion of the transaction, the Company assumed the Sense 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Sense Plan”). In addition, pursuant to the Sense Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Sense common stock and each award of time-based RSUs in respect of shares of Sense common stock held by Sense employees, in each case, that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was automatically adjusted by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Sense Agreement) and converted into an equity award of the same type covering shares of the Company’s common stock, on the same terms and conditions, (including, if applicable, any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable Sense plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Assumed Awards”). In connection with the closing of the acquisition, 
82,311
 stock options and 
449,098
 RSUs were assumed.
On February 10, 2023, the Company consummated the Velodyne Merger. Pursuant to the Velodyne Merger, the Company assumed the Velodyne Lidar, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Velodyne Plan”), and all restricted stock units granted thereunder that were outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Velodyne Merger and converted into restricted stock units covering shares of the Company’s common stock (such assumed awards, the “Assumed RSUs”) and all shares of Velodyne Lidar, Inc. restricted stock were converted into shares of Company restricted stock. Each Assumed RSU and award of restricted stock is subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related Velodyne restricted stock unit award or restricted stock award immediately prior to the consummation of the Velodyne Merger, except that the number of shares of common stock subject to each Assumed RSU or constituting restricted stock was adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Velodyne Merger Agreement. In connection with the consummation of the Velodyne Merger, 
961,012
 Assumed RSUs and 
728,646
 shares of restricted stock were assumed. Pursuant to the terms of the Velodyne Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases on January 1 of each year by the lesser of 
820,400
 shares or such smaller number of shares determined by the board of directors. In addition, any shares that are subject to awards forfeited and any shares of restricted stock that are forfeited will be available for grant under the Velodyne Plan. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had reserved 
1,077,184
 shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance under the Velodyne Plan.

Employee benefit plan
In 2018, the Company adopted a defined contribution retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company at its discretion offers matching contributions of up to 
4
% of each employee’s annual compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of $
1.7
 million and $
2.1
 million to the plan during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance of $
259.7
 million and $
305.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, against its U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets. The Company determines its valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence in order to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. Due to the history of losses the Company has generated in the past, the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that all of its U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets can be realized as of December 31, 2024.
The valuation allowance on the Company’s net deferred taxes decreased by $
45.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to an increase of $
235.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the generation of net operating losses and capitalization of research and development expenditures.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
913.2
 million and $
415.8
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely and the state net operating loss carryforward begins expiring in 2028 through 2043. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of federal net operating loss that does not expire is $
833.3
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $
5.0
 million and $
12.8
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 the federal credits will expire starting in 2035, if not utilized and state credits carryforward indefinitely.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and similar state legislation impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the event there is a change in ownership as provided by Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. We have completed an analysis of Section 382 ownership changes in our stock through February 10, 2023 and have concluded that we have experienced ownership changes that will result in limitations in our ability to use certain of our tax credit carryforwards. The Company may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock. If it is determined that we undergo one or more ownership changes in the future, then our ability to utilize our U.S. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited or eliminated.

The balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 was $
24.8
 million and $
24.8
 million, respectively. Out of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $
0.5
 million at December 31, 2024, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has accrued immaterial interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 
The following table sets forth the change in the uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. for Federal, California, and other US states, as well as miscellaneous foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities. The earliest year open for examination is the 2016 tax year. The Company’s 2017 and 2018 tax years are currently under IRS examination. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the tax examination. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of the examination is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. All of the net operating losses and research and development credit carry-forwards that may be used in future years are still subject to inquiry given that the statute of limitation for these items would begin in the year of the utilization.

Revenue
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective lidar sensor kits. Revenue recognized over time is immaterial to total revenue recognized for any given period.

Revenue contract balances
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. An unbilled receivable is recorded in instances when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, and amounts collected in advance of services being provided are recorded as deferred revenue. Contract assets are generated when contractual billing schedules differ from revenue recognition timing.
Unbilled receivables
A receivable for multi-year licensing services is generally recorded upon invoicing. A receivable for multi-year license contracts is recorded upon delivery, whether or not invoiced, to the extent the Company has an unconditional right to receive payment in the future related to those licenses. As of December 31, 2024, the current portion of these unbilled receivables in the amount of $
3.3
 million, primarily consisting of unbilled receivables from multi-year license contracts, is included in “Accounts receivable, net” on the consolidated balance sheet.
Contract Assets 
Contract assets primarily relate to the Company’s rights to consideration under license arrangements when the licenses have been transferred to the customers, but payment is contingent upon a future event, other than the passage of time (i.e. type of unbilled receivable) and for which the Company does not have an unconditional right at the reporting date. 
Contract asset also arises when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when revenue is recognized on guaranteed minimum payments at the inception of the contract when there is not yet a right to invoice in accordance with contract terms and payment is contingent upon future event. 
95
Table of Contents
Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, advanced payments and deposits from customers for goods and services that are yet to be provided. Deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized related to product sales, licenses, extended warranty and other services revenue, and is recognized as revenue when the Company performs under the contract. The long-term portion of deferred revenue, mostly related to obligations under license arrangements and extended warranty, is classified as non-current contract liabilities and is included in other non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Customer advanced payments represent required customer payments in advance of product shipments according to customer’s payment term. Customer advance payments are recognized as revenue when control of the performance obligation is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits represent consideration received from a customer which can be applied to future product or service purchases, or refunded.
Contract assets and liabilities are presented net at the individual contract level in the consolidated balance sheet and are classified as current or long-term based on the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations.

Deferred revenues from multi-year licensing contracts mainly represent minimum royalty payments received from licensees relating to long-term IP license contracts for which the Company has future obligations under the license agreements. Royalties from the IP licenses are recognized at the later of the period the sales occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated. The Company evaluated its performance obligations under multi-year licensing contracts and did not recognize any revenue under such licensing contracts in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 because the Company concluded there is significant uncertainty associated with resolving the Company’s performance.
Other contract liabilities primarily relate to a multi-year contract entered in 2023 with a customer to sell its products. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company signed a new contract, which was subsequently modified, with this customer that added new service performance obligations and modified certain payment, pricing and delivery terms. As a result, the Company received an additional $
16.2
 million in payments from this customer, which was recorded in other contract liabilities. Modifications were accounted for in accordance with the contract modification framework. As of December 31, 2024, $
21.5
 million remained deferred under the contract until a future product and service delivery date.

Segments
The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information including revenue, expenses and net income presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by certain supplemental information about significant expense categories for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating the Company’s financial performance. The Company operates as 
one
 reportable and operating segment, which relates to the sale and production of lidar sensor kits and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. The CODM assesses financial performance of the reportable segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income that also is reported as net income attributable to the Company on the consolidated statements of income. Net income is also used by our chief operating decision maker to monitor actual results versus budget and prior periods amounts of our reportable segment and decide how to expand business or to return value to shareholders. The measure of the segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment as of December 31, 2024 of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses described below.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of internal controls and accounting knowledge, experience, and training commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weakness.
•
We did not design and maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting process to ensure, for other than journal entries, that segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts were identified, reviewed and mitigated by appropriately designed mitigating controls as needed to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures.
The material weakness related to the control environment resulted in adjustments to several account balances and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, adjustments to the equity and warrant liabilities accounts and related disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and an immaterial adjustment which was recorded prior to the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024. The material weakness related to segregation of duties did not result in a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, each of these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

Remediation Measures of Unremediated Material Weaknesses
As it relates to the above material weaknesses that continued to exist as of December 31, 2024, our management is committed and continues to make progress to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We continued implementation of a plan to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the above material weaknesses. These remediation measures are ongoing and include the following:
•
Improve internal controls to ensure that segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts are timely identified, reviewed and mitigated by appropriately designed mitigating controls and procedures. This includes periodic monitoring of changes in roles and responsibilities that could impact SOD conflicts within the period-end financial reporting process.
•
Continuing to recruit personnel with appropriate internal controls, accounting knowledge and experience commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements, in addition to engaging and utilizing third party consultants and specialists. Our management also continued to reallocate and align roles and responsibilities within the accounting team to optimize and leverage the skills and experience of various personnel.
•
Continuing to provide internal control training for personnel responsible for implementing internal controls for the Company.
These investments in resources have improved the stability of our accounting organization. While significant progress has been made in response to the material weaknesses, time is needed to demonstrate sustainability as it relates to our internal control over financial reporting and improvements made to our complement of resources, including demonstrating sustained operating effectiveness of our internal controls related to SOD. We are committed to continuous improvement and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting.
Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses
As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management concluded that we did not design and maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting process to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including adequate controls related to journal entries, and verifying transactions are properly classified in the financial statements. Our management completed the following actions and measures designed to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the above material weaknesses:
•
Throughout 2024, we enhanced the design and/or operation over internal controls for period end financial reporting to ensure transactions are properly classified in our financial statements, and controls related to preparation and review of journal entries. Building on the controls designed and implemented in the previous financial years, we continued to strengthen and improve these controls during 2024.
Our management completed its documentation, testing and evaluation of the enhanced control activities and determined that, as of December 31, 2024, these control activities have been appropriately designed and implemented, and have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time to conclude that these previously identified material weaknesses related to controls over the period-end financial reporting process to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including adequate controls related to journal entries, and verifying transactions are properly classified in the financial statements, have been remediated.
Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was not required to be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 due to Ouster being deemed a Smaller Reporting Company (SRC) within the definition of Rule 12b-2 as the company’s public float was below the specified thresholds as of June 30, 2024. Accordingly, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
