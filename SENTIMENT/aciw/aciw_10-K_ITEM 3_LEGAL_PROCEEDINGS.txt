ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ACIW.
As of February 24, 2025, there were 
213
 holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of shareholders hold our common stock in “street name”, or as beneficial holders whose shares are held in the name of banks, brokers, or other financial institutions.
For equity compensation plan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report.
Dividends
We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not presently anticipate paying cash dividends. However, any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors (the "board") and will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, and earnings, as well as other factors the board may deem relevant. The terms of our current Credit Facility may restrict the payment of dividends subject to us meeting certain financial metrics and being in compliance with the events of default provisions of the agreement.

Pursuant to our 2020 Equity and Performance Incentive Plans, (the "2020 Incentive Plan"), we granted RSUs. Under each arrangement, shares are issued without direct cost to the employee.  During the three months ended December 31, 2024, 204,636 shares of RSUs vested. We withheld 67,719 of these RSUs to pay the employees’ portion of the applicable minimum payroll withholding taxes. 
In 2005, the board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us, as market and business conditions warrant, to acquire our common stock and periodically authorizes additional funds for the program, with the intention of using existing cash and cash equivalents to fund these repurchases. In June 2024, the board approved the repurchase of the Company's common stock for up to $400.0 million, in place of the remaining purchase amounts previously authorized. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum remaining amount authorized for purchase under the stock repurchase program was approximately $372.5 million.

Table of Contents
There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares we will repurchase. Repurchased shares are returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In March 2005, the board approved a plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of shares of common stock under the existing stock repurchase program. Under our Rule 10b5-1 plan, we have delegated authority over the timing and amount of repurchases to an independent broker who does not have access to inside information about the Company. Rule 10b5-1 allows us, through the independent broker, to purchase shares at times when we ordinarily would not be in the market because of self-imposed trading blackout periods, such as the time immediately preceding the end of the fiscal quarter through a period of three business days following our quarterly earnings release.
Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return
The following table shows a line-graph presentation comparing cumulative stockholder return on an indexed basis with a broad equity market index and either a nationally-recognized industry standard or an index of peer companies selected by us. We selected the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 600 Index for comparison. The S&P 600 Index will replace the S&P MidCap 400 Index going forward, as the Company is now included in the S&P 600 Index. The S&P MidCap 400 index has been included with data through 2024.
The graph above compares ACI Worldwide, Inc.’s annual percentage change in cumulative total return on common shares over the past five years with the cumulative total return of companies comprising the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 600 Index. This presentation assumes that $100 was invested in shares of the relevant issuers on December 31, 2019, and that dividends received were immediately invested in additional shares. The graph plots the value of the initial $100 investment at one-year intervals for the fiscal years shown. This information was provided by Zacks Investment Research, Inc. of Chicago, Illinois.
The stock performance graph disclosure above is not considered “filed” with the SEC under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference in any past or future filing by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically referenced.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
ACI Worldwide, an innovator in global payments technology, delivers software solutions that power intelligent payments orchestration in real time so banks, merchants, and billers can drive growth, while continuously modernizing their payment infrastructures, simply and securely. With nearly 50 years of trusted payments expertise, we combine our global footprint with a local presence to offer enhanced payment experiences to stay ahead of constantly changing payment challenges and opportunities.
Our products are sold and supported directly and through distribution networks covering three geographic regions – the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Each region has its own globally coordinated sales force, supplemented with local independent reseller and/or distributor networks. Our products and solutions are marketed under the ACI Worldwide brand and used globally by banks of all sizes, central banks, intermediaries, merchants, and billers, such as third-party digital payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges, and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including ATMs, merchant POS terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites.  
We derive a majority of our revenues from domestic operations and believe we have large opportunities for growth in international markets, as well as continued expansion domestically in the United States. We also continue to maintain centers of expertise in Timisoara, Romania, and Pune and Bangalore in India, as well as key operational centers such as in Cape Town, South Africa and in multiple locations in the United States.
Our business and operating results are influenced by trends such as information technology spending levels, the growth rate of digital payments, mandated regulatory changes, and changes in the number and type of customers in the financial services industry, as well as economic growth, and purchasing habits.
Key trends that currently impact our strategies and operations include:
Increasing digital payment transaction volumes
.
 The adoption of digital payments continues to accelerate, propelled by the digitization of cash, financial inclusion efforts of countries throughout the world, rapid growth of eCommerce, and the adoption of real-time payments enabling more people, governments, and businesses to embrace digital payments. We leverage the growth in transaction volumes through the licensing of new systems to customers whose older systems cannot handle increased volume, through the sale of capacity upgrades to existing customers, and through the scalability of our platform-based solutions.
Adoption of real-time payments.
 Expectations from both consumers and businesses are continuing to drive the payments world to more real-time delivery. This is bolstered by the new data-rich ISO 20022 messaging format prevalent in account-to-account payments, which is delivering greater value to banks and their customers and has now been rolled out across the world and continues to see adoption with local schemes, such as FedWire, planned for 2025. We are seeing global players with existing schemes working to expand capacity in anticipation of volume growth and new payment types. Domestic schemes such as Unified Payments Interface ("UPI") in India and others are being made available to their citizens for cross-border transactions when abroad.  Mature markets, including India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, continue to accelerate innovation, especially in terms of overlay services, driving new transactions. The United States is driving real-time payments adoption through TCH Real-Time Payments and the FedNow Service. Asia is one of the most innovative markets for adoption of real-time payment systems. According to ACI’s Prime Time for Real-Time report, Asia Pacific is the largest regional market, with four of the global top five real-time payment markets by volume. ACI provides solutions for commercial and central banks across Asia. Latin American countries are pushing ahead with real-time payments modernization initiatives, looking to replicate Brazil’s success with PIX. ACI is also providing solutions centrally in Colombia and Peru. We are seeing success with real-time payments in the Middle East as well, as they have started to renovate their payment systems from legacy payment types to the modern digital and real-time world. ACI's broad software portfolio, experience, and strategic partnerships with Mastercard, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Mindgate Solutions continue to position us as a leader in real-time payments, helping to drive seamless connectivity, increased security, and end-to-end modernization for organizations throughout the world.
Adoption of cloud technology
.
 ACI has recognized the industry's technical inflection point in the transition from traditional on-premises infrastructure to the private and public cloud, and we are supporting our customers' cloud strategies. Cloud technology innovations allow the financial services ecosystem to remove technical risk from their operations, accelerate innovation and time to market for new revenue-generating solutions for their customers, and accelerate innovation and ensure scalability and resiliency while improving operating economics over time.  As banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers 
29
Table of Contents
seek to transition their systems to make use of cloud technology, our investments and partnerships, as demonstrated by our product enablement and initial optimization onto Microsoft Azure, enable us to leverage those cloud technology benefits today and for the future while preserving ACI's fundamental base of performance, resiliency, and scalability. Cloud-native solutions running in a multi-tenant SaaS environment also allow ACI to expand our market coverage to smaller institutions, offering scalable solutions which are easy to integrate with but at price points that fit their budgets.
Payments intelligence, fraud, and compliance
. The accelerated adoption of real-time payments, fraudsters leveraging artificial intelligence, and the ramping up of mandates increase the urgency for industry-wide collaboration to mitigate fraud with precision and achieve operational excellence. As the threat of sophisticated fraud becomes a greater concern for remitting and receiving institutions, consumers are challenged with increased friction to prevent illegitimate access of genuine accounts or funds to protect the consumer trust and confidence, while achieving their strategic objectives. Regulators are beginning to litigate between consumers and financial institutions on the losses, and between remitting and receiving banks on the accountability. Banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers are pursuing solutions to mitigate their risks while improving their customer experience, protecting their margins, and securing their revenue streams, especially with their new products and offerings. We continue to evolve our advanced machine learning and network intelligence capabilities to stop criminals and enable frictionless, legitimate business. Meanwhile, with payments intelligence, organizations can integrate intelligent services to enhance consumer relationships while achieving precise, real-time fraud and risk mitigation capabilities.
Omni-commerce. 
Shoppers are increasingly browsing, buying, and returning items across channels, including in-store, online, and mobile. This trend has led to an increase in contactless payments, click and collect, and curbside collection. Merchants from all industries, including grocers, fuel and convenience stores, are being tasked with delivering seamless experiences that include pay-in-aisle, kiosks, mobile app payments, QR code payments, eCommerce, traditional and mobile POS, buy online pickup in-store (BOPIS), and buy online return in-store (BORIS). We believe there is significant opportunity to provide merchants with the tools to deliver a seamless, secure, personalized experience that creates loyalty and satisfaction, and drives conversion rates while protecting consumer data and preventing fraud.

Open banking
.

Open banking is gaining momentum globally, and while it has been accelerated in Europe by regulations like PSD3, the United States is also seeing significant shifts driven by market demand and technology innovation rather than regulatory mandates. In the United States, the growing adoption of Request to Pay (RTP) offers an alternative to traditional bill payment methods, allowing payers to respond directly to payment requests with flexibility on timing, method, and amount. This aligns with the broader movement toward real-time payments, supported by platforms like the FedNow
®
 Service and The Clearing House’s RTP network. While the United States doesn't have a regulatory equivalent to PSD3, there's a strong push for open banking solutions that provide greater control and transparency for consumers, and RTP is a key trend within that space. By embracing both RTP and open banking trends in the United States, payment processors and financial institutions can offer more dynamic, flexible payment options, driving innovation and improving customer experience, while staying competitive in a rapidly evolving payments landscape. ACI is in a unique position to deliver service that takes advantage of our real-time payments software, our relationships with banks, merchants, and billers, and global connectivity.
Several other factors related to our business may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year. For example, the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition are complex, and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction. Factors such as creditworthiness of the customer and timing of transfer of control or acceptance of our products may cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods. For arrangements in which services revenue is deferred, related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred. Additionally, while the majority of our contracts are denominated in the U.S. dollar, a substantial portion of our sales are made, and some of our expenses are incurred, in the local currency of countries other than the United States. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in a given period may result in the recognition of gains or losses for that period.
We continue to seek ways to grow through organic sources, partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions. We continually look for potential acquisitions designed to improve our solutions’ breadth or provide access to new markets. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek acquisition candidates that are strategic, capable of being integrated into our operating environment, and accretive to our financial performance.
Divestiture
On September 1, 2022, we sold our corporate online banking solutions related assets and liabilities to One Equity Partners ("OEP") for $100.0 million, and a net working capital adjustment. The sale included employees and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property.
30
Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $38.5 million on the sale, which is recorded in other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
During the year ended 
December 31, 2023
, the Company recognized a loss for the final post-closing adjustment pursuant to the definitive agreement of $0.5 million, which is recorded in other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company and OEP had also entered into a Transition Services Agreement ("TSA"), whereby the Company would continue to perform certain functions on OEP's behalf during a migration period which ended in 2024. The TSA was meant to reimburse the Company for direct costs in order to provide such functions, which are no longer generating revenue for the Company.
Backlog
Backlog is comprised of:
•
Committed Backlog, which includes (1) contracted revenue that will be recognized in future periods (contracted but not recognized) from software license fees, maintenance fees, service fees, and SaaS and PaaS fees specified in executed contracts (including estimates of variable consideration if required under ASC 606, 
Revenue From Contracts with Customers
) and included in the transaction price for those contracts, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods and (2) estimated future revenues from software license fees, maintenance fees, services fees, and SaaS and PaaS fees specified in executed contracts.
•
Renewal Backlog, which includes estimated future revenues from assumed contract renewals to the extent we believe recognition of the related revenue will occur within the corresponding backlog period.
We have historically included assumed renewals in backlog estimates based upon automatic renewal provisions in the executed contract and our historic experience with customer renewal rates.
Our 60-month backlog estimates are derived using the following key assumptions:
•
License arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term or under the renewal option stated in the contract at a rate consistent with historical experience. If the license arrangement includes extended payment terms, the renewal estimate is adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component.
•
Maintenance fees are assumed to exist for the duration of the license term for those contracts in which the committed maintenance term is less than the committed license term.
•
SaaS and PaaS arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term at a rate consistent with our historical experiences.
•
Foreign currency exchange rates are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period for those contracts stated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
•
Our pricing policies and practices are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period.
In computing our 60-month backlog estimate, the following items are specifically not taken into account:
•
Anticipated increases in transaction, account, or processing volumes by our customers.
•
Optional annual uplifts or inflationary increases in recurring fees.
•
Services engagements, other than SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are not assumed to renew over the 60-month backlog period.
•
The potential impact of consolidation activity within our markets and/or customers.
We review our customer renewal experience on an annual basis. The impact of this review and subsequent updates may result in a revision to the renewal assumptions used in computing the 60-month backlog estimates. In the event a significant revision to renewal assumptions is determined to be necessary, prior periods will be adjusted for comparability purposes.

Estimates of future financial results require substantial judgment and are based on several assumptions, as described above. These assumptions may turn out to be inaccurate or wrong for reasons outside of management’s control. For example, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for many reasons, including mergers, changes in their financial condition, or general changes in economic conditions in the customer’s industry or geographic location. We may also experience delays in the development or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts, which may cause the actual renewal rates and amounts to differ from historical experiences. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog estimates will generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the corresponding 60-month period. Additionally, because certain components of Committed Backlog and all of Renewal Backlog estimates are operating metrics, the estimates are not required to be subject to the same level of internal review or controls as contracted but not recognized Committed Backlog.

Table of Contents
Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) Revenue
The Company’s SaaS arrangements allow customers to use certain software solutions (without taking possession of the software) in a single-tenant cloud environment on a subscription basis. The Company’s PaaS arrangements allow customers to use certain software solutions (without taking possession of the software) in a multi-tenant cloud environment on a subscription or consumption basis. Included in SaaS and PaaS revenue are fees paid by our customers for use of our Biller solutions. Biller-related fees may be paid by our clients or directly by their customers and may be a percentage of the underlying transaction amount, a fixed fee per executed transaction or a monthly fee for each customer enrolled. SaaS and PaaS costs include payment card interchange fees, the amounts payable to banks and payment card processing fees, which are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. All fees from SaaS and PaaS arrangements that do not qualify for treatment as a distinct performance obligation, which includes set-up fees, implementation or customization services, and product support services, are included in SaaS and PaaS revenue.
SaaS and PaaS revenue increased $48.8 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
The impact of certain foreign currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar resulted in a $0.5 million increase in SaaS and PaaS revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, SaaS and PaaS revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $48.3 million, or 6%, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
The increase was primarily due to higher transaction volumes during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, as well as new customer go-lives since December 31, 2023.
License Revenue
Customers purchase the right to license ACI software under multi-year, time-based software license arrangements that vary in length but are generally five years. Under these arrangements the software is installed at the customer’s location (i.e. on-premise). Within these agreements are specified capacity limits typically based on customer transaction volume. ACI employs measurement tools that monitor the number of transactions processed by customers and if contractually specified limits are exceeded, additional fees are charged for the overage. Capacity overages may occur at varying times throughout the term of the agreement depending on the product, the size of the customer, and the significance of customer transaction volume growth. Depending on specific circumstances, multiple overages or no overages may occur during the term of the agreement.
Included in license revenue are license and capacity fees that are payable at the inception of the agreement. License revenue also includes license and capacity fees payable annually, quarterly, or monthly due to negotiated customer payment terms. The Company recognizes revenue in advance of billings for software license arrangements with extended payment terms and adjusts for the effects of the financing component, if significant.
License revenue increased $91.1 million, or 28%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
The impact of certain foreign currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar resulted in a $3.0 million decrease in license revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.
•
Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $94.1 million, or 30%, as compared to the same period in 2023.  
•
The increase in license revenue was driven by license renewal timing as well as the relative size of new license and capacity events during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

Maintenance Revenue
Maintenance revenue includes standard and premium customer support and any post contract support fees received from customers for the provision of product support services.
Maintenance revenue decreased $14.3 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
The impact of foreign currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar resulted in a $0.2 million decrease in maintenance revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
•
Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $14.1 million, or 7%, as compared to the same period in 2023.
•
The decrease was primarily driven by customers reducing premium customer support and maintenance on non-strategic products during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.
Services Revenue
Services revenue includes fees earned through implementation services and other professional services. Implementation services include product installations, product configurations, and custom software modifications (“CSMs”). Other professional services include business consultancy, technical consultancy, on-site support services, product education, and testing services. These services include new customer implementations as well as existing customer migrations to new products or new releases of existing products.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility over the next 12 months and beyond.
38
Table of Contents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024, we had $216.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $116.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we may potentially be required to accrue and pay foreign and U.S. state income taxes to repatriate these funds. As of December 31, 2024, only the earnings from our Indian foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. We are also permanently reinvested in the outside book/tax basis differences related to foreign subsidiaries. These outside basis differences could reverse through the sale of foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which are considered probable as of December 31, 2024.

The increase in total liquidity is primarily attributable to the $100.0 million increase in the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility and cash flows generated from operations.
The Company and ACI Payments, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, maintain a $75.0 million uncommitted overdraft facility with Bank of America, N.A. The overdraft facility acts as a secured loan under the terms of the Credit Agreement to provide an additional funding mechanism for timing differences that can occur in the bill payment settlement process. As of December 31, 2024, the full $75.0 million was available.
On February 26, 2024, we entered into a Refinance Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2019 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including by the Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”) with ACI Worldwide Corp and ACI Payments, Inc. as co-borrowers, the lenders, and Bank of America N.A, as administrative agent and lender. The Amendment, among other things, (i) provides a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, (ii) provides a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, and (iii) extends the maturity date of the Facilities to February 26, 2029. The proceeds of the borrowings under the Amendment, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance all outstanding borrowings and replace all existing revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the date of the Amendment and will be used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes. 
Stock Repurchase Program
The board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company, as market and business conditions warrant, to acquire its common stock and periodically authorizes additional funds for the program. In June 2024, the board approved the repurchase of the Company's common stock of up to $400.0 million in place of the remaining purchase amounts previously authorized.
We repurchased 3,946,537 shares for $128.5 million under our stock repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2024. Under the program to date, we have repurchased 62,867,837 shares for approximately $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum remaining amount authorized for purchase under the stock repurchase program was approximately $372.5 million. 
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, debt repayment obligations, our stock price, and global economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan and they may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers for purchase and renewal of licensed software products and various services including software and platform as a service, maintenance, and other professional services. Our primary uses of operating cash flows include employee expenditures, taxes, interest payments, and leased facilities.
Cash flows provided by operating activities was $358.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 113% compared to $168.5 million for the same period in 2023.  This increase is attributed to improved profitability and corresponding cash flows primarily from customer receipt collections and lower income tax payments, partially offset by working capital use.
Our cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including: the timing of billings, which are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters in conjunction with sales timing and are variable based upon license renewal timing; collections, which will lag the quarters with higher billings; the timing and amounts of interest due to interest rate fluctuations and semi-annual Senior Notes interest payments; income tax and other payments; and our operating results.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases and investments in capital and other assets, including strategic acquisitions, that support our growth.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we used cash of $45.1 million to purchase software, property, and equipment, as compared to $37.8 million during the same period in 2023.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments and other debt, stock repurchases, and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. 
During 2024, we repaid a net $57.2 million on the Term Loan under the Amendment, $54.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, $14.9 million of other debt payments, and $5.1 million of debt issuance costs. In addition, we used $127.7 million to repurchase common stock, $13.1 million for the repurchase of stock-based compensation awards for tax withholdings, and $25.5 million for settlement assets and liabilities due to processing timing. We received proceeds of $9.2 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended. During 2023, we repaid $73.0 million on the Term Loans, $16.8 million of other debt payments, and $2.2 million of debt issuance costs. In addition, we used $27.6 million to repurchase common stock, $5.1 million for the repurchase of stock-based compensation awards for tax withholdings, and $15.4 million for settlement assets and liabilities due to processing timing. We received net proceeds of $19.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds of $9.5 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following key accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1, 
Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
 and Note 2, 
Revenue
, to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of significant accounting policies and revenue recognition.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue From Contracts with Customers, 
revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products and services.
Our software license arrangements provide the customer with the right to use functional intellectual property for the duration of the contract term. Implementation, support, and other services are typically considered distinct performance obligations when sold with a software license. Significant judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of our software licenses are highly variable, we estimate SSP of our software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, we will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.
When a software license arrangement contains payment terms that are extended beyond one year, a significant financing component may exist. The significant financing component is calculated as the difference between the stated value and present value of the software license fees and is recognized as interest income over the extended payment period. Judgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component.
We assess the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.
41
Table of Contents
Our SaaS-based and PaaS-based arrangements represent a single promise to provide continuous access to our software solutions and their processing capabilities in the form of a service through one of our data centers. These arrangements may include fixed and/or variable consideration. Fixed consideration is recognized over the term of the arrangement and variable consideration, which is a function of transaction volume or another usage-based measure, generally meets the allocation objective and revenue is recognized as the usage occurs.
We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the creditworthiness of the customer, economic conditions in the customer’s industry and geographic location, and general economic conditions.
Certain of our arrangements are through unrelated distributors or sales agents. For software license arrangements in which we act as a distributor of another company’s product, and in certain circumstances, modify or enhance the product, revenues are recorded on a gross basis. These include arrangements in which we take control of the products and are responsible for providing the product or service. For software license arrangements in which we act as a sales agent for another company’s product, revenues are recorded on a net basis. Judgment is required in evaluating the facts and circumstances of our relationship with the distributor or sales agent as well as our operating history and practices that can impact the timing of revenue recognition related to these arrangements. For software license arrangements in which we utilize a third-party distributor or sales agent, we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of the software license(s) to the third-party distributor or sales agent.
We may execute more than one contract or agreement with a single customer at or near the same time. The separate contracts or agreements may be viewed as one combined arrangement or separate agreements for revenue recognition purposes. We evaluate whether the agreements were negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the products or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation, or whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance of another agreement to reach appropriate conclusions regarding whether such arrangements are related or separate. The conclusions reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related to those arrangements.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of intangible assets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, were $165.4 million and $195.6 million, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions used, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an impact on our results of operations.
Other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from four to 20 years.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our goodwill was $1.2 billion. In accordance with ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,
 we assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using October 1 balances, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. We evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level and have identified our reportable segments, Banks, Merchants, and Billers, as our reporting units. Recoverability of goodwill is measured using a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow valuation model is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value.
42
Table of Contents
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections, and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates, and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change, as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC considers market and industry data, as well as Company-specific risk factors. Operational management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of the reporting unit may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value. The calculated fair value substantially exceeds the current carrying value for all reporting units. No reporting units were deemed to be at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test under ASC 350.
Stock-Based Compensation
On June 9, 2020, upon recommendation of the board, stockholders approved the ACI Worldwide, Inc. 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan authorizes the board to provide for equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents, and certain other awards, including those denominated or payable in, or otherwise based on, our common stock ("awards"). The purpose of the 2020 Plan is to provide incentives and rewards for service and/or performance by providing awards to non-employee directors, officers, other employees, and certain consultants and other service providers of us and our subsidiaries. Following the approval of the 2020 Plan, the 2016 Incentive Plan was terminated. Termination of the 2016 Incentive Plan did not affect any equity awards outstanding under the 2016 Incentive Plan or 2005 Incentive Plan.
Performance share awards granted with a total shareholder return component ("TSRs") are shares that are earned, if at all, based upon achievement of performance goals over a specified period. For 2024 and 2023, performance share awards granted are earned, if at all, based upon achievement, over a specified period that must not be less than one year and is typically a three-year performance period. The awards have operating performance goals that include (i) adjusted EBITDA metrics and (ii) revenue growth rates as determined by the Company with a TSR multiplier up to plus or minus 20%. Up to 200% of the performance shares could be earned upon achievement of the performance goals, including the multiplier. For 2022, performance share awards granted are earned, if at all, based upon the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year performance period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200%. To determine the grant date fair value of the TSRs, a Monte Carlo simulation model is used. We recognize compensation expense for the TSRs over the performance period based on the grant date fair value. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achieved, if at all, and the anticipated level of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the consolidated financial statements. 
Restricted share unit awards (“RSUs”) generally have requisite service periods of three years and may vest 100% upon the three-year anniversary or in equal increments quarterly or annually. Under each arrangement, RSUs are issued without direct cost to the employee on the vesting date. We estimate the fair value of RSUs based upon the market price of our stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation models, as well as the description of the plans the stock-based awards are granted under are described in further detail in Note 6,
 Stock-Based Compensation Plans
, to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and/or foreign tax credit carryforwards, the adequacy of valuation allowances, and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities.
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. As part of our process of determining current tax liability, we exercise judgment in evaluating positions we have taken in our tax returns. We periodically assess our tax exposures and establish, or adjust, estimated unrecognized benefits for probable assessments by taxing authorities, including the 
43
Table of Contents
Internal Revenue Service, and various foreign and state authorities. Such unrecognized tax benefits represent the estimated provision for income taxes expected to ultimately be paid. It is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments or positions and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of, or realize benefits less than, those currently recorded. In addition, changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pretax income could impact our overall effective tax rate.
To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Although we have considered future taxable income along with prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, if we should determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period any such determination was made. Likewise, in the event we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period any such determination was made.
New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted
For information related to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, 
Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Excluding the impact of changes in interest rates, inflationary pressures, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets, there have been no material changes to our market risk for the year ended December 31, 2024. We conduct business in all parts of the world and are thereby exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is the single largest currency in which our revenue contracts are denominated. Any decline in the value of local foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar results in our products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign customer. In those instances where our goods and services have already been sold, receivables may be more difficult to collect. Additionally, in jurisdictions where the revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local currency, any decline in the value of the U.S. dollar will have an unfavorable impact to operating margins. At times, we enter into revenue contracts that are denominated in the country’s local currency, primarily in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, Brazil, India, and Singapore. This practice serves as a natural hedge to finance the local currency expenses incurred in those locations. We have not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or arbitrage.
The primary objective of our cash investment policy is to preserve principal without significantly increasing risk. If we maintained similar cash investments for a period of one year based on our cash investments and interest rates at December 31, 2024, a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in effective interest rates would increase or decrease interest income by $0.3 million annually.
We had approximately $0.9 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2024, with $532.5 million outstanding under our Credit Facility and $400.0 million in 2026 Notes. Our Credit Facility has a floating rate, which was 6.21% at December 31, 2024. Our 2026 Notes are fixed-rate long-term debt obligations with a 5.750% interest rate. A hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in effective interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense related to the Credit Facility by approximately $3.3 million.

In connection with our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under the supervision of, and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Management based its assessment on criteria established in “Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and Deloitte & Touche, LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ACI Worldwide, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ACI Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ACI Worldwide, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ACI Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Software License Arrangements - Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. The Company’s software license arrangements provide the customer with the right to use functional intellectual property (as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted) for the duration of the contract term. Implementation, support, and other services are typically considered distinct performance obligations when sold with a software license. 
49
Table of Contents
Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer arrangements, and includes the following:
•
Determination of the term of a software license arrangement when early termination rights are provided to the customer.
•
Determination of whether products and/or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately.
•
Determination of whether the financing component in a software licensing arrangement is significant and, if so, the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component.
•
Assessment of whether the extension of payment terms in a software licensing arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price.
•
Determination of the standalone selling price for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates standalone selling price of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable standalone selling prices exist for the other services.
Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments in determining revenue recognition for software license arrangements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s accounting for software license arrangements included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of software license arrangements, including, among others, the determination of the contract term, identification of performance obligations, determination of significant financing component, estimation of variable consideration, and determination of standalone selling prices, including those controls over the determination that software license pricing is highly variable.
•
We selected a sample of software license arrangements and performed the following, among others:
•
Obtained contract source documents for each selection, including separate contracts or agreements that should be combined with the selected arrangement, and other documents that were part of the arrangement.
•
Tested management’s determination of the contract term, identification of performance obligations, determination of significant financing component, estimation of variable consideration, and determination of standalone selling prices.
•
Evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology and estimates used by management and the appropriateness of its revenue recognition conclusions for these key judgment areas.
•
Tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.
•
We evaluated management’s determination that software license pricing is highly variable by obtaining management’s highly variable analysis and performing the following:
•
Testing the completeness of management’s analysis by tracing a selection of known data points from contracts into the highly variable analysis.
•
Testing the accuracy of management’s analysis by selecting a sample of contracts from the highly variable analysis, obtaining the contract and price detail, and evaluating whether discounts were appropriately included in the analysis.
•
Testing the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Business
ACI Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “ACI” or the “Company”) develop, market, install, and support a broad line of software products and services primarily focused on facilitating electronic payments. In addition to its own products, the Company distributes or acts as a sales agent for software developed by third parties. These products and services are used principally by banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers, both in domestic and international markets.
Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Capital Stock
The Company’s outstanding capital stock consists of a single class of common stock. Each share of common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote for each matter subject to a stockholder’s vote and to dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors (the “board”).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents includes holdings in checking, savings, money market, and overnight sweep accounts, all of which have daily maturities, as well as time deposits with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.

Other Current Liabilities
Other current liabilities include the following (in thousands):

Settlement Assets and Liabilities
Individuals and businesses settle their obligations to the Company’s various Biller clients using credit or debit cards or via automated clearing house (“ACH”) payments. The Company creates a receivable for the amount due from the credit or debit card processor and an offsetting payable to the client. Upon confirmation that the funds have been received, the Company settles the obligation to the client. Due to timing, in some instances, the Company may (1) receive the funds into bank accounts controlled by and in the Company’s name that are not disbursed to its clients by the end of the day, resulting in a settlement deposit on the Company’s books and (2) disburse funds to its clients in advance of receiving funds from the credit or debit card processor, resulting in a net settlement receivable position.
56
Table of Contents
Off Balance Sheet Settlement Accounts
The Company also enters into agreements with certain Biller clients to process payment funds on their behalf. When an ACH or automated teller machine network payment transaction is processed, a transaction is initiated to withdraw funds from the designated source account and deposit them into a settlement account, which is a trust account maintained for the benefit of the Company’s clients. A simultaneous transaction is initiated to transfer funds from the settlement account to the intended destination account. These “back to back” transactions are designed to settle at the same time, usually overnight, such that the Company receives the funds from the source at the same time as it sends the funds to their destination. However, due to the transactions being with various financial institutions there may be timing differences that result in float balances. These funds are maintained in accounts for the benefit of the client which is separate from the Company’s corporate assets. As the Company does not take ownership of the funds, these settlement accounts are not included in the Company’s balance sheet. The Company is entitled to interest earned on the fund balances. The collection of interest on these settlement accounts is considered in the Company’s determination of its fee structure for clients and represents a portion of the payment for services performed by the Company.
 The amount of settlement funds as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $
267.0
 million and $
273.2
 million, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of these assets is generally computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives based on asset class.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, net property and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):

Software
Software may be for internal use or for resale. Costs related to certain software, which is for resale, are capitalized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 985-20, 
Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed
, when the resulting product reaches technological feasibility. The Company generally determines technological feasibility when it has a detailed program design that takes product function, feature and technical requirements to their most detailed, logical form and is ready for coding. The Company does not typically capitalize costs related to software for resale as technological feasibility generally coincides with general availability of the software. The Company capitalizes the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40,
 Internal Use Software
. The Company expenses all costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of its development and capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software are capitalized if it is determined that these upgrades or enhancements add additional functionality to the software. Costs incurred during the application development stage include purchased software licenses, implementation costs, consulting costs, and payroll-related costs for projects that qualify for capitalization. All other costs, primarily related to maintenance and minor software fixes, are expensed as incurred.
Amortization of software for resale is determined on a product-by-product basis and begins when the product is available for licensing to customers. The annual amortization is computed using the greater of (a) the ratio of current gross revenues to the total of current and future gross revenues expected to be derived from the software or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of generally 
five
 to 
ten years
, including the period being reported on. Due to competitive pressures, it may be possible that the estimates of future gross revenue or remaining estimated useful life of the software will be reduced significantly. As a result, the carrying amount of the software may be reduced accordingly. Amortization of internal-use software is generally computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 
three
 to 
eight years
.

Fair Value
ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, (“ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.
•
Level 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
The fair value of the Company’s Credit Agreement approximates the carrying value due to the floating interest rate (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The Company measures the fair value of its Senior Notes based on Level 2 inputs, which include quoted market prices and interest rate spreads of similar securities. The fair value of the Company’s 
5.750
% Senior Notes due 2026 (“2026 Notes”) was $
399.2
 million and $
398.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate the carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
In accordance with ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
, the Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year using October 1 balances or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. The Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level using the discounted cash flow valuation model and allocates goodwill to these reporting units using a relative fair value approach. During this assessment, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, and anticipated future cash flows. The Company has identified its reportable segments, Banks, Merchants, and Billers, as the reporting units. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's goodwill balance of $
1.2
 billion was allocated $
671.7
 million to Banks, $
137.3
 million to Merchants, and $
417.0
 million to Billers.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections, and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates, and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change, as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period, assuming a constant WACC and low, long-term growth rates.  If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit.  The calculated fair value substantially exceeded the current carrying value for all reporting units for all periods.
Other intangible assets, which include customer relationships and trademarks and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 
four
 to 
20
 years. The Company reviews its other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Equity Method Investment
In July 2019, the Company invested $
18.3
 million for a 
30
% non-controlling financial interest in a payment technology and services company in India. The Company accounted for this investment using the equity method in accordance with ASC 323, 
Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures
. The Company records its share of earnings and losses in the investment on a one-quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment of $
18.6
 million and $
18.5
 million, which is included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of the impairment charge is measured based upon the fair value of the asset group.
Treasury Stock
The Company accounts for shares of its common stock that are repurchased without intent to retire as treasury stock. Such shares are recorded at cost and reflected separately on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. The Company issues shares of treasury stock upon exercise of stock options, issuance of restricted share units, payment of earned performance shares, and for issuance of common stock pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. For purposes of determining the cost of the treasury shares re-issued, the Company uses the average cost method.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
In accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation,
 ("ASC 718") the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards that are probable of vesting on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in operating expenses depending on where the respective individual’s compensation is recorded. To determine the grant date fair value of total shareholder return awards (“TSRs”), a Monte Carlo simulation model was used. The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation models, as well as the description of the plans the stock-based awards are granted under, are described in further detail in Note 6, 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
The Company’s foreign subsidiaries typically use the local currency of the countries in which they are located as their functional currency. Their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses, including those related to intercompany accounts, that are not considered to be of a long-term investment nature are included in the determination of net income. Transaction gains and losses, including those related to intercompany accounts, that are considered to be of a long-term investment nature are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company periodically assesses its tax exposures and establishes, or adjusts, estimated unrecognized tax benefits for probable assessments by taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, and various foreign and state authorities. Such unrecognized tax benefits represent the estimated provision for income taxes expected to ultimately be paid.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update will require disclosure of more disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early application is permitted for annual 
59

financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on its income tax disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.
 The amendments in this update will require entities to provide disaggregated disclosures of specific expense categories underlying certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and early application is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statement footnote disclosures.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis.  The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 10, 
Segment Information,
 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
2. 
Revenue 
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606,
 Revenue From Contracts With Customers
, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products and services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 
Contract Combination.
 The Company may execute more than one contract or agreement with a single customer at or near the same time. The separate contracts or agreements may be viewed as one combined arrangement or separate agreements for revenue recognition purposes. In order to reach appropriate conclusions regarding whether such agreements should be combined, the Company evaluates whether the agreements were negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance of another agreement, or whether the product(s) or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation. The conclusions reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related to those arrangements.
Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) Arrangements.
 The Company’s SaaS-based and PaaS-based arrangements, including implementation, support and other services, represent a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e. a stand-ready performance obligation) to its software solutions and their processing capabilities in the form of a service through one of the Company’s data centers. As each day of providing access to the software solution(s) is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, the Company’s single promise under its SaaS-based and PaaS-based arrangements is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company’s SaaS-based and PaaS-based arrangements may include fixed consideration, variable consideration, or a combination of the two. Fixed consideration is recognized over the term of the arrangement or longer if the fixed consideration relates to a material right. A material right would be a separate performance obligation. The Company estimates the stand-alone selling price for a material right by reference to the services expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration. Variable consideration in these arrangements is typically a function of transaction volume or another usage-based measure. Depending upon the structure of a particular arrangement, the Company: (1) allocates the variable amount to each distinct service period within the series and recognizes revenue as each distinct service period is performed, (2) estimates total variable consideration at contract inception (giving consideration to any constraints that may apply and updating the estimates as new information becomes available) and recognizes the total transaction price over the period to which it relates, or (3) applies the ‘right to invoice’ practical expedient and recognizes revenue based on the amount invoiced to the customer during the period.
License Arrangements.
 The Company’s software license arrangements provide the customer with the right to use functional intellectual property (as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted) for the duration of the contract term. Implementation, support, and other services are typically considered distinct performance obligations when sold with a software license.
Payment terms for the Company’s software license arrangements generally include fixed license and capacity fees that are payable up front or over time. These arrangements may also include incremental usage-based fees that are payable when the 
60
Table of Contents
customer exceeds its contracted license capacity limits. The Company accounts for capacity overages as a usage-based royalty that is recognized when the usage occurs.
When a software license arrangement contains payment terms that are extended beyond one year, a significant financing component may exist. The significant financing component is calculated as the difference between the stated value and present value of the software license fees and is recognized as interest income over the extended payment period. The total fixed software license fee net of the significant financing component is recognized as revenue at the point in time when the software is transferred to the customer.
For those software license arrangements that include customer-specific acceptance provisions, such provisions are generally presumed to be substantive and the Company does not recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance, objective demonstration that the delivered product meets the customer-specific acceptance criteria, or the expiration of the acceptance period. The Company recognizes revenues on such arrangements upon the earlier of receipt of written acceptance or the first production use of the software by the customer.
For software license arrangements in which the Company acts as a distributor of another company’s product, and in certain circumstances, modifies or enhances the product, revenues are recorded on a gross basis. These include arrangements in which the Company takes control of the products and is responsible for providing the product or service. For software license arrangements in which the Company acts as a sales agent for another company’s product, revenues are recorded on a net basis. These include arrangements in which the Company does not take control of products and is not responsible for providing the product or service.
For software license arrangements in which the Company utilizes a third-party distributor or sales agent, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of the software license(s) to the third-party distributor or sales agent.
The Company’s software license arrangements typically provide the customer with a standard 
90
-day assurance-type warranty. These warranties do not represent an additional performance obligation as services beyond assuring that the software license complies with agreed-upon specifications are not provided.
Software license arrangements typically include an initial post contract customer support (maintenance or “PCS”) term of 
one year
 with subsequent renewals for additional years within the initial license period. The Company’s promise to those customers who elect to purchase PCS represents a stand-ready performance obligation that is distinct from the license performance obligation and recognized over the PCS term.
The Company also provides various professional services to customers with software licenses. These include project management, software implementation, and software modification services. Revenues from arrangements to provide professional services are generally distinct from the other promises in the contract(s) and are recognized as the related services are performed. Consideration received under these arrangements is either fixed fee or on a time-and-materials basis, which represents variable consideration that must be estimated using the most likely amount based on the range of hours expected to be incurred in providing the services.
The Company estimates the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for maintenance and professional services based on observable stand-alone sales. The Company applies the residual approach to estimate the SSP for software licenses.

Significant Judgments
The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information.
The Company also applies judgment in determining the term of an arrangement when early termination rights are provided to the customer.
The Company’s software license arrangements with its customers often include multiple promises to transfer licensed software products and services. Determining whether the products and/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.

Table of Contents
The Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
Judgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.
Judgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimate the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company’s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.
Significant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.
Contract Balances
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company’s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.
Total receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e. accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.

Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
The Company accounts for costs to obtain and fulfill its contracts in accordance with ASC 340-40.
The Company capitalizes certain of its sales commissions that meet the definition of incremental costs of obtaining a contract and for which the amortization period is greater than 
one year
. The costs associated with those sales commissions are capitalized during the period in which the Company becomes obligated to pay the commissions and are amortized over the period in which the related products or services are transferred to the customer. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
2.0
 million and $
3.3
 million of these costs are included in other current assets, respectively, and $
9.9
 million and $
13.9
 million of these costs are included in other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $
8.7
 million of sales commission expense related to the amortization of these costs, which is included in selling and marketing expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill its contracts that: (1) relate directly to the arrangement, (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Company’s performance obligation under the arrangement, and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the arrangement. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as the Company transfers the related services to the customer. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, less than $
0.1
 million of these costs are included in other current assets, and $
9.4
 million and $
9.7
 million of these costs are included in other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts capitalized primarily relate to direct costs that enhance resources under the Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements. During both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $
3.6
 million of expense related to the amortization of these costs, which is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.

The Amendment (i) provides a senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $
500
 million, (ii) provides a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) of up to $

35
 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $
20
 million sublimit for swingline loans. Amounts repaid under the Revolving Facility may be reborrowed.
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at borrower's option, either (A) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.5

100
% of the capital stock of each domestic subsidiary of the borrower and 
65
% of the voting capital stock of each foreign subsidiary that is directly owned by a borrower, in each case subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

 terms and may include auto-renewal terms without notice of intent to terminate the agreement.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
two
 letter of credit agreements outstanding for a total of $
1.9
 million.
The letters of credit reduce the maximum available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to $

Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On April 6, 2017, the board approved the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2017 ESPP”), which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 Annual Shareholder meeting. The 2017 ESPP provides employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Under the Company’s 2017 ESPP, a total of 
3,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance to eligible employees. Participating employees are permitted to designate up to the lesser of $
25,000
 or 
10
% of their annual base compensation for the purchase of common stock under the ESPP. Purchases under the ESPP are made one calendar month after the end of each fiscal quarter. The price for shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP is 
85
% of the stock’s fair market value on the last business day of the 
three-month
 participation period.
Additionally, the discount offered pursuant to the Company’s ESPP discussed above is 
15
%, which exceeds the 5% non-compensatory guideline in ASC 718 and exceeds the Company’s estimated cost of raising capital. Consequently, the entire 
15
% discount to employees is deemed to be compensatory for purposes of calculating expense using a fair value method. Compensation expense related to the ESPP was approximately $
0.5
 million for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $
0.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Stock Incentive Plans – Active Plans
2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan
On June 9, 2020, upon recommendation of the board, stockholders approved the ACI Worldwide, Inc. 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan authorizes the board to provide for equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents, and certain other awards, including those denominated or payable in, or otherwise based on, the Company’s common stock ("awards"). The purpose of the 2020 Plan is to provide incentives and rewards for service and/or performance by providing awards to non-employee directors, officers, other employees, and certain consultants and other service providers of the Company and its subsidiaries. Following the approval of the 2020 Plan, the 2016 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the “2016 Incentive Plan”) was terminated. Termination of the 2016 Incentive Plan did not affect any equity awards outstanding under the 2016 Incentive Plan.
Subject to adjustment and share counting rules as described in the 2020 Plan, a total of 
6,658,754
 shares of common stock are available for awards granted under the 2020 Plan. Shares underlying certain awards under the 2020 Plan, the Company’s 2005 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the "2005 Incentive Plan"), and the 2016 Incentive Plan (each including as amended or amended and restated) that are cancelled or forfeited, expire, are settled for cash, or are unearned after June 9, 2020, will again be available under the 2020 Plan.
The board generally will be able to amend the 2020 Plan, subject to stockholder approval in certain circumstances, as described in the 2020 Plan.
2016 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan
The Company's 2016 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and other awards. The 2016 Incentive Plan was adopted by the stockholders on June 14, 2016. Following the adoption of the 2016 Incentive Plan, the 2005 Incentive Plan was terminated. Subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, the maximum number of shares of common stock that was issued or transferred in connection with awards granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan was the sum of (i) 
8,000,000
 shares of common stock and (ii) any shares of common stock that were represented by options previously granted under the 2005 Incentive Plan which were subsequently forfeited, expired, or cancelled without delivery of common stock or which resulted in the forfeiture or relinquishment of common stock back to the Company. 
2005 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan
The Company's 2005 Incentive Plan, as amended, under which shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance to eligible employees or non-employee directors of the Company. The 2005 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and other awards. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that was issued or transferred in connection with awards granted under the 2005 Incentive Plan was the sum of (i) 
23,250,000
 shares and (ii) any shares represented by outstanding options that had been granted under designated terminated stock option plans that were subsequently forfeited, expired, or are cancelled without delivery of the Company’s common stock.
68
Stock Options
Stock options granted pursuant to the Company's incentive plans were granted at an exercise price not less than the market value per share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The term of the outstanding options may not exceed 
ten years
 nor be less than 
one year
. Vesting of options is determined by the compensation committee of the board and the administrator of the respective plan and can vary based upon the individual award agreements. In addition, outstanding options do not have dividend equivalent rights associated with them.

The Company did not grant stock options during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, was $
10.9

Performance Share Awards
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, pursuant to the 2020 Plan, the Company granted performance share awards with a total shareholder return component ("TSRs"). For 2024 and 2023, these performance share awards are earned, if at all, based upon achievement, over a specific period that must not be less than 
one year
 and is typically a 
three-year
 performance period. The awards have operating performance goals that include (i) adjusted EBITDA metrics and (ii) revenue growth rates as determined by the Company with a TSR multiplier up to plus or minus 
20
%. Up to 
200
% of the performance shares could be earned upon achievement of the performance goals, including the multiplier. For 2022, the Company granted performance share awards that are earned, if at all, based upon the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a 
three-year
 performance period. The award payout can range from 
0
% to 
200
%. To determine the grant date fair value of the TSRs, a Monte Carlo simulation model is used. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the TSRs over the performance period based on the grant date fair value. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achieved, if at all, and the anticipated level of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the consolidated financial statements. 
A summary of nonvested TSRs is as follows:

Restricted Share Units
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, pursuant to the 2020 Plan, the Company granted restricted share unit awards (“RSUs”). RSUs generally have requisite service periods of 
three years
 and may vest 
100
% upon the 
three-year
 anniversary or in equal increments quarterly or annually. RSUs granted to the board vest 
one year
 from grant or as of the next annual shareholders meeting, whichever is earlier. Under each arrangement, RSUs are issued without direct cost to the recipient on the vesting date. The Company estimates the fair value of the RSUs based upon the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
A summary of nonvested RSUs is as follows:

Segment Information 
The Company reports financial performance based on its operating segments, Banks, Merchants, and Billers, and analyzes Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of segment profitability.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is also the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM, together with other senior management personnel, focus their review on consolidated financial information and the allocation of resources based on operating results, including revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, for each segment, separate from corporate operations. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.
Banks.
 ACI provides payment solutions to large and mid-size banks globally for retail banking, digital, and other payment services. These solutions transform banks’ complex payment environments to speed time to market, reduce costs, and deliver a consistent experience to customers across channels while enabling them to prevent and rapidly react to fraudulent activity. In addition, they enable banks to meet the requirements of different real-time payments schemes and to quickly create differentiated products to meet consumer, business, and merchant demands.
71
Merchants.
 ACI’s support of merchants globally includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants (in-store and online), payment service providers, independent selling organizations, value-added resellers, and acquirers who service them. These customers operate in a variety of verticals, including general retail, grocery, hospitality, dining, travel and ticketing, fuel, telecommunications, and others. The Company's solutions provide merchants with a secure, omnichannel payments platform that gives them flexibility and independence. The Company also offers secure solutions to online-only merchants that provide consumers with a convenient and seamless way to shop. 
Billers. 
Within the billers segment, ACI provides electronic bill presentment and payment services to companies operating in the consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, utility, government, mortgage, subscription provider, and telecommunications categories. The solutions enable these customers to support a wide range of payment options and provide a convenient consumer payments experience that drives consumer loyalty and increases revenue. ACI also provides fraud abuse protection to its biller customers leveraging its proven AI, human, and data capabilities.
Revenue is attributed to the reportable segments based upon customer. Expenses are attributed to the reportable segments in one of three methods: (1) direct costs of the segment, (2) labor costs that can be attributed based upon time tracking for individual projects, or (3) costs that are allocated. Allocated costs are generally marketing and sales related activities.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the measure reported to the CODM for purposes of making decisions on allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company’s segments, including budget and forecast-to-actual variances, and, therefore, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented in conformity with ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings from operations before interest, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude net other income (expense). 
Corporate and unallocated expenses includes global facilities and information technology costs and long-term product roadmap expenses in addition to corporate overhead costs that are not allocated to reportable segments. The overhead costs relate to human resources, finance, legal, accounting, and merger and acquisition activity. These costs along with depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances recorded. 
At
 December 31, 2024, valuation allowances recorded primarily related to net operating losses, foreign tax credit carryforwards, and future interest deductions.
At
 December 31, 2024, the Company had domestic federal tax net operating losses (“NOLs”) of $
42.8
 million, of which $
2.9
 million may be utilized over an indefinite life, with the remainder beginning to expire in 2025. The Company had deferred tax assets equal to $
0.7
 million related to domestic state tax NOLs which will begin to expire in 2025. The Company did not have any valuation allowance against the federal tax NOLs but had provided a $
0.4
 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the state NOLs. The Company had foreign tax NOLs of $
14.5
 million, of which $
14.4
 million may be utilized over an indefinite life, with the remainder expiring over the next 
five years
. The Company did not have any valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the foreign NOLs.
78
The Company had U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2024, of $
2.7
 million, for which a $
2.7
 million valuation allowance had been provided. The U.S. foreign tax credits will begin to expire in 2028. The Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards in other foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2024, of $
3.9
 million, of which $
0.7
 million may be utilized over an indefinite life, with the remainder expiring over the next 
seven years
. The Company had provided a $
0.7
 million valuation allowance against the tax benefit associated with these foreign credits. The Company also had domestic federal general business tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2024, of $
26.6
 million, which will expire in 2037 and state general business tax credit carryforwards of $
0.4
 million, which will begin to expire in 2026.
The Company did not provide deferred taxes on $
45.7
 million of unremitted earnings of its Indian subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. The company did not estimate the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine or is immaterial to the financial statements.

As of December 31, 2024, deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $
31.5
 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $
1.0
 million and $
0.6
 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a German interest deduction carryforward of $
9.0
 million and $
8.5
 million, respectively, for which a full valuation allowance had been provided. The deferred interest deduction has an indefinite life.
The unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $
21.0
 million and $
20.9
 million, respectively, of which $
10.7
 million and $
10.5
 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Of the total unrecognized tax benefit amounts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
20.4
 million and $
20.1
 million, respectively, represent the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax rate in the respective years.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions. The United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom are the main taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The years open for audit vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. In the United States, the Company’s federal tax return for years following 2020 are open for audit. In the foreign jurisdictions, the tax returns open for audit generally vary by jurisdiction between 2005 and 2023.
The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s Indian income tax returns covering fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2014, 2016 and 2020 through 2023 are under audit by the Indian tax authority. Other foreign subsidiaries could face challenges from various foreign tax authorities. It is not certain that the local authorities will accept the Company’s tax positions. The Company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to vigorously defend its positions. However, differing positions on certain issues could be upheld by tax authorities, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
79
The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months by approximately $
0.8
 million due to the settlement of various audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company accrues interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense or interest income and recognizes penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income or other expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
0.4
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively, is accrued for the payment of interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities. The aggregate amount of interest and penalties expense (benefit) recorded in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, was $(
0.1
) million, $(
0.1
) million, and $(
0.5
) million, respectively.

Leases
The Company has operating leases primarily for corporate offices and data centers. Excluding office leases, leases with an initial term of 12-months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company’s leases typically include certain renewal options to extend the leases for up to 
25
 years, some of which include options to terminate the leases within 
one year
. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company combines lease and non-lease components of its leases and currently has no leases with options to purchase the leased property. Payments of maintenance and property tax costs paid by the Company are accounted for as variable lease cost, which are expensed as incurred.
The Company has entered into an assignment and assumption of lease agreement with a third-party for one of its corporate offices. The third-party is responsible for making payments directly to the landlord and the related lease's initial term expires on September 30, 2031. During an initial period ending April 30, 2025, the Company is required to make a base rent contribution of less than $
0.1
 million per month to the third-party, with the third-party responsible for the entirety of the lease payments after that date.

The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. As the Company enters into operating leases in multiple jurisdictions and denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, judgment is used to determine the Company’s incremental borrowing rate including (1) conversion of its subordinated borrowing rate (using published yield curves) to an unsubordinated and collateralized rate, (2) adjusting the rate to align with the term of each lease, and (3) adjusting the rate to incorporate the effects of the currency in which the lease is denominated.

Commitments and Contingencies 
In accordance with ASC 460, 
Guarantees
, the Company recognizes the fair value for guarantee and indemnification arrangements it issues or modifies if these arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation. In addition, the Company must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications, as required under the previously existing generally accepted accounting principles, to identify if a loss has occurred. If the Company determines it is probable a loss has occurred, then any estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications. Under its customer agreements, the Company may agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless its customers from and against certain losses, damages, and costs arising from claims alleging that the use of its software infringes the intellectual property of a third-party. Historically, the Company has not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded a liability relating to such provisions.
Under its customer agreements, the Company also may represent and warrant to customers that its software will operate substantially in conformance with its documentation, and that the services the Company performs will be performed in a workmanlike manner by personnel reasonably qualified by experience and expertise to perform their assigned tasks. Historically, only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of warranty claims. In addition, from time to time, the Company may guarantee the performance of a contract on behalf of one or more of its subsidiaries, or a subsidiary may guarantee the performance of a contract on behalf of another subsidiary.
Other guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company’s executive officers, directors, and certain other key officers. The Company’s certificate of incorporation provides that it will indemnify and advance expenses to its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. The indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by a person, by reason of the fact that such person is, was, or has agreed to be a director or 
81
officer, in connection with the investigation, defense, and settlement of any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, proceeding, or claim. The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the use of indemnification agreements, and the Company enters into such agreements with its directors and certain officers from time to time. These indemnification agreements typically provide for a broader scope of the Company’s obligation to indemnify the directors and officers than set forth in the certificate of incorporation. The Company’s contractual indemnification obligations under these agreements are in addition to the respective directors’ and officers’ rights under the certificate of incorporation or under Delaware law. 
Legal Proceedings
In April 2021, ACH files associated with one of the Company's mortgage servicing customers were inadvertently transmitted into the ACH network during a test of the Company's payment processing system. The Company took immediate corrective action and issued reversing ACH files, restoring affected accounts. 
The Company’s customer commenced an action for damages as a result of this event. The Company settled with the customer for the amount of $
1.8
 million, which was funded by insurance carriers.
Funds received from or expected to be received from insurance carriers are generally subject to the respective carriers' reservation of rights.  
The Company is from time to time subject to other claims, litigation, and investigations. While the Company believes that none of the currently pending matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on it, there can be no assurance with respect thereto or future matters.
14. 
Employee Benefit Plans 
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $
13.2
 million, $
12.8

75

30,500
 (for employees aged 50 or older on December 31, 2024). The Company matches 
100
% of the first 
4
% of eligible participant contributions and 
50
% of the next 
4
% of eligible participant contributions, not to exceed $
6,000
 per employee annually. Effective January 1, 2024, employees are eligible for the Company match immediately. Employees hired January 1, 2024, and after have a

6.2
 million, $

 million, and $
6.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

10
