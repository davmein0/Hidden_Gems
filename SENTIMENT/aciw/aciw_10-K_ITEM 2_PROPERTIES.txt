ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We lease office space in Elkhorn, Nebraska, for our principal executive offices. As of the end of 2024, we owned and leased a total of approximately 245,000 square feet of office and data center space in the United States and leased approximately 269,000 square feet of office and data center space outside the United States, primarily in India, Ireland, South Africa, Romania, and Singapore.
We believe our current facilities are adequate for our present and short-term foreseeable needs and that additional suitable space will be available as required. We also believe we will be able to renew leases as they expire or secure alternate suitable space.
