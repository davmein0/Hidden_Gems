Item 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Padagis Israel Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Padagis US LLC, and Padagis LLC (collectively, Padagis) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on March 27, 2024, based on the submission to the FDA of an ANDA seeking approval to market and sell a generic version of Arcutis’ ZORYVE® 0.3% cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. The Company asserts infringement of the following eleven patents, which are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Arcutis’ ZORYVE® 0.3% cream: 9,884,050; 9,907,788; 10,940,142; 11,129,818; 11,793,796;11,819,496; 11,992,480; 12,005,051; 12,005,052; 12,011,437; and 12,016,848 (collectively, Asserted Patents). Arcutis seeks a judgment that Padagis has infringed or will infringe one or more claims of each of the Asserted Patents and based on that judgment, a permanent injunction prohibiting the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation into the United States of Padagis’s proposed generic product before expiration of each of the Asserted Patents found to infringe.
On July 19, 2024, Arcutis filed its first amended complaint that added the last five of the above listed patents to its infringement allegations.  These patents were issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and listed in FDA’s Orange Book for Arcutis’s ZORYVE® 0.3% cream after the filing of the original complaint. On August 2, 2024, Padagis responded to the first amended complaint, denying infringement and asserting counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgement that the asserted patents are not infringed, invalid, and/or unenforceable. The court issued a scheduling order on June 10, 2024, which sets trial at the court’s convenience, or around April 13-17, 2026.  The automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval of Padagis’s ANDA seeking approval for Arcutis’s ZORYVE® 0.3% cream is set to expire on August 14, 2026.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. filed Oppositions with the European Patent Office against two of our European patents, European Patent Nos. EP 3634380 B1 and EP 3684334 B1, on September 20, 2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively. These patents relate to topical roflumilast compositions. Arcutis filed replies on January 23, 2025 and February 24, 2025, respectively. Hearings before the EPO’s Opposition Division are not yet scheduled and the proceedings are ongoing.
We may from time to time be involved in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other material legal proceedings.

Please also see the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for dermatological diseases with high unmet medical needs. Our current portfolio is comprised of highly differentiated topical and systemic treatments with significant potential to treat immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions. We believe we have built a leading platform for dermatologic product development and commercialization. Our strategy is to focus on validated biological targets, and to use our drug development platform and deep dermatology expertise to develop and commercialize differentiated products that have the potential to address the major shortcomings of existing therapies in our targeted indications. We believe this strategy uniquely positions us to rapidly advance our goal of bridging the treatment innovation gap in dermatology, while maximizing our probability of technical success and financial resources. 
We launched our lead product, ZORYVE
®
 (roflumilast) cream 0.3% (ZORYVE cream 0.3%) in August 2022 after obtaining our initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including psoriasis in the intertriginous areas (e.g. groin or axillae), in individuals 12 years of age or older.  ZORYVE cream 0.3% is a once-daily topical formulation of roflumilast, a highly potent and selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. ZORYVE cream 0.3% is approved for once-daily treatment of mild, moderate, and severe plaque psoriasis with no limitations on location or duration of use.  In October 2023, we received FDA approval for an expanded indication in plaque psoriasis down to 6 years of age.  We are currently working with the FDA to potentially further expand this indication in plaque psoriasis down to 2 years of age following the generation of additional clinical data. In April 2023, we had our first commercial launch outside of the United States following Health Canada approval of ZORYVE cream 0.3% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in individuals 12 years or age or older.
In December 2023, we received FDA approval for ZORYVE
®
 (roflumilast) topical foam 0.3% (ZORYVE foam) for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in individuals aged 9 years and older, with no limitation on severity, location, or duration of use. ZORYVE foam is a once-daily steroid-free foam and, as a PDE4 inhibitor, is the first drug approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with a new mechanism of action in over two decades.  ZORYVE foam became commercially available in the United States in late January 2024, and was approved by Health Canada in October 2024 and became commercially available in Canada in December 2024.  
In addition to the approval of ZORYVE cream 0.3% for plaque psoriasis and ZORYVE foam for seborrheic dermatitis, we also received FDA approval for and commercially launched ZORYVE (roflumilast) cream 0.15% (ZORYVE cream 0.15%), (collectively, ZORYVE), in July 2024 for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, with no limitation on location, body surface area treated, concomitant use, or duration of use specified in the approved labelling. ZORYVE cream 0.15% is a once-daily, steroid-free cream that provides rapid disease clearance and significant reduction in itch and has been specifically developed to be a treatment option for long-term disease control. We have also completed a Phase 3 trial of ZORYVE cream 0.05% in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED). Based on the positive results from the INTEGUMENT-PED study, and given our recent approval of ZORYVE cream 0.15% for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in individuals 6 years of age or older, we submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for topical ZORYVE cream 0.05% for children 2 to 5 years of age in December 2024. We conducted INTEGUMENT-OLE, an open label extension study of the long-term safety of ZORYVE cream 0.15% in subjects 6 years of age or older and ZORYVE cream 0.05% in

s
subjects between the ages 2 and 5 years, for which we reported positive results in September 2023 and August 2024, respectively.
Beyond seborrheic dermatitis, we are also developing ZORYVE foam for scalp and body psoriasis and have successfully completed our Phase 2b and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. We announced positive topline data in September 2022, with ZORYVE foam showing rapid disease clearance and significant reduction in itch.  In the pivotal Phase 3 ARRECTOR study, at Week 8, 66% of individuals treated with ZORYVE foam achieved the co-primary efficacy endpoint of Scalp IGA Success, defined as a Scalp IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-point improvement, and 46% of patients achieved the co-primary efficacy endpoint of Body IGA Success, defined as a Body IGA score of "clear" or "almost clear" plus a 2-point improvement.  In addition, individuals treated with ZORYVE foam reported reductions in itch from baseline within 24 hours of first application.  Based on the ARRECTOR results and a Phase 2b study, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA for a label expansion to include scalp and body psoriasis in adults and adolescents ages 12 and over, which was recently accepted by the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date in May 2025.
In July 2024, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kowa)  to leverage Kowa's primary care sales force to exclusively market and promote ZORYVE in the United States to primary care practitioners and pediatricians for all FDA-approved indications until at least July 2029. Under the terms of the agreement, Kowa will receive a commission from net sales attributed to Kowa. Promotion of ZORYVE in primary care and pediatrics under the Kowa agreement began in late September 2024.
In addition to ZORYVE, we are developing ARQ-255, a deep-penetrating topical formulation of ivarmacitinib, a potent and highly selective topical Janus kinase type 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, designed to preferentially deliver the drug deep into the hair follicle, the site of inflammation in alopecia areata, in order to potentially develop the first topical treatment for this disease. We completed enrollment in a Phase 1b study evaluating ARQ-255 for the treatment of alopecia areata and expect data in the first half of 2025. 
In September 2022, we acquired Ducentis BioTherapeutics LTD (Ducentis) and its lead asset, DS-234 (now ARQ-234), a fusion protein that is a potent and highly selective checkpoint agonist of the CD200 Receptor (CD200R). Currently in the preclinical stage, we plan to develop ARQ-234 in atopic dermatitis, where we believe it could be a potentially highly complementary biologic treatment option to ZORYVE cream in that indication, if approved. ARQ-234 could potentially be used to treat other inflammatory conditions as well. We are working towards submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application during 2025.
We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, including net losses of $140.0 million, $262.1 million and $311.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,121.9 million and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of

$228.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million outstanding under the Loan Agreement. We paid down $100.0 million of principal related to the Loan Agreement using available cash on October 8, 2024, with the right to re-draw that principal for a defined period. 
We expect to continue to incur losses and significant expenses as we commercialize ZORYVE, and as we advance our product candidates and label extensions through clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and commercialization. We expect to incur significant and prioritized commercialization expenses related to the sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution of ZORYVE, while we focus our clinical development spend on ARQ-234, ARQ-255, and ZORYVE label extensions, if we obtain regulatory approval for them. If our available cash and marketable securities balances, amounts available under the Loan Agreement, and anticipated future cash flows from operations are insufficient to cover these expenses, we may need to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources, such as future potential collaboration agreements. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms if or when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See “Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Requirements” below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
We rely on third parties to conduct our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our product candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, many of whom are single source suppliers, for our nonclinical and clinical trial materials, as well as the commercial supply of our products.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Product Revenue, Net
In August 2022, in conjunction with the launch of our first FDA approved product, ZORYVE cream 0.3%, we began to recognize revenue from product sales, net of rebates, chargebacks, discounts, and other adjustments. We also began recognizing revenue net of deductions for ZORYVE cream 0.3% in Canada in June 2023, ZORYVE foam in the United States in January 2024, ZORYVE cream 0.15% for atopic dermatitis in July 2024, and ZORYVE foam in Canada in December 2024. Additionally, if our development efforts for our other product candidates and ZORYVE label extensions are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate additional revenue in the future from product sales.
Other Revenue
Other revenue relates to our license agreements, primarily the Sato License Agreement and the

Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement
. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of ZORYVE, including raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, and freight-in, as well as third-party royalties payable on our net product sales and amortization of intangible assets associated with ZORYVE.
Our cost of sales will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials until inventory that was previously expensed is sold, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2025. As of December 31, 2024

and December 31, 2023, the value of this inventory, mostly at the raw materials stage, was approximately $5.5 million and $8.7 million, respectively.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts, and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include direct program expenses, which are payments made to third parties that specifically relate to our research and development, such as payments to clinical research organizations, clinical investigators, manufacturing of clinical material, nonclinical testing, and consultants. In addition, employee costs, including salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation, and travel for employees contributing to research and development activities are classified as research and development costs. We allocate direct external costs on a program specific basis (topical roflumilast program, topical JAK inhibitor program, and early-stage programs). Our internal costs are primarily related to personnel or professional services and apply across programs, and thus are not allocable on a program specific basis.
We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in the future as we develop our product candidates. In particular, we expect to incur research and development expenses for the phase 1 ARQ-255 study for alopecia areata, and early development of ARQ-234 for atopic dermatitis.
We have entered, and may continue to enter, into license agreements to access and utilize certain molecules for the treatment of dermatological diseases and disorders. We evaluate if the license agreement is an acquisition of an asset or a business. To date, none of our license agreements have been considered to be an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, the upfront payments, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval, are immediately recognized as research and development expense when due, provided there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, or costs required to complete the remaining development of ZORYVE cream and ZORYVE foam, ARQ-255, and ARQ-234 or any other product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation, and travel, and costs related to sales and marketing of ZORYVE. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, insurance, and professional services fees for auditing, tax, and general legal services. The commission paid to Kowa under our co-promotion agreement is recorded as a selling expense. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we continue to commercialize ZORYVE and potentially other product candidates, and support our operations, including increased expenses related to legal, accounting, insurance, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, directors and officers liability insurance premiums, and investor relations activities.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as changes in the fair value of the derivative related to our debt. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Interest Expense
Interest expense is related to interest incurred on our long term debt.

Product revenue, net, for ZORYVE cream 0.3% increased by $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher end customer demand and improving gross-to-net discounts for ZORYVE cream 0.3% in the United States.
Product revenue, net, for ZORYVE foam increased by $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by its commercial launch in January 2024. 
Product revenue, net, for ZORYVE cream 0.15% increased by $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by its commercial launch in July 2024.
Other revenue
Other revenue in the year ended December 31, 2024 is a result of license revenues received in connection with the Sato License Agreement of $25.0 million and the Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement of $5.0 million.  Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily included licensed revenues received in connection with the Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement of $30.0 million. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased by $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is related primarily to an increase in customer demand for ZORYVE cream 0.3% and launch of ZORYVE foam in 2024. Prior to the dates on which the initial regulatory approvals were received for each product, inventory manufacturing and raw materials costs were recorded as research and development expense. Therefore, cost of sales will reflect a lower average per unit cost until the related inventory is sold, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2025.

______________
*Not applicable
Research and development expenses decreased by $34.2 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of Phase 3 studies of roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis, coupled with decreases in compensation and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by manufacturing and preclinical costs incurred related to the development of early-stage programs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $44.2 million, or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and personnel related expenses of $28.9 million and an increase in sales and marketing expenses of $14.1 million. These increases were primarily due to our continued commercialization efforts for ZORYVE. 
Other Income, Net
Other income, net increased by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on a higher marketable securities balance for the first three quarters of the year.

Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and the partial prepayment of principal related to the Loan Agreement. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Provision for Income Taxes
Income tax expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $3.1 million for

the year ended December 31, 2023 were due to income tax expense related to withholding taxes on payments received in connection with the Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement. See Note 7 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Requirements
Our primary sources of capital to date have been private placements of preferred stock, our IPO completed in January 2020, our follow-on financings in October 2020, February 2021, August 2022, October 2023, and March 2024, our Loan Agreement, our ATM program, and revenue from the sale of ZORYVE. We have incurred operating losses since our inception and have an accumulated deficit as a result of ongoing efforts to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates, including conducting nonclinical and clinical trials and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $228.6 million and $272.8 million, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of $1,121.9 million and $981.9 million, respectively. We maintain cash

s
balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million outstanding under the Loan Agreement. We paid down $100.0 million of principal related to the Loan Agreement using available cash on October 8, 2024, with the right to re-draw that principal for a defined period. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the projected operating requirements for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of our financial statements.
If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may need to fund our operations through the sale of our equity securities, accessing or incurring additional debt, entering into licensing or collaboration agreements with partners, grants, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us at all or on attractive terms when needed from these sources. If we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources if or when needed it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through, among other things, reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back, or stopping certain research and development programs, nonclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities, and commercialization efforts. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose.  In addition, market conditions impacting financial institutions could impact our ability to access some or all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we may be unable to obtain alternative funding when and as needed on acceptable terms, if at all. 
We have based our projected operating requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•

On December 22, 2021, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Prior Loan Agreement) with SLR Investment Corp (SLR) and the lenders party thereto. The Prior Loan Agreement was amended and restated on January 10, 2023 (the AR Loan Agreement) to include Arcutis Canada, Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, as a borrower and party. On November 1, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the AR Loan Agreement to, among others, (i) modify the financial covenant relating to minimum net product revenue, and (ii) include an additional minimum financing covenant. On August 9, 2024, we entered into a second amendment to the AR Loan Agreement (the AR Loan Agreement, as amended by the first and second amendments, the Loan Agreement) to, among others, (i) permit, during the period commencing on October 7, 2024 and ending on December 15, 2024, an optional partial prepayment of term loans outstanding, subject to a 1.0% prepayment penalty (the 2024 Partial Prepayment), (ii) add the tranche C-1 and tranche C-2 term loans, and (iii) facilitate certain other changes, including with respect to the applicable interest rate and maturity date in the event of a 2024 Partial Prepayment. The term loan facility is comprised of (i) a tranche A term loan of $75.0 million, (ii) a tranche B-1 term loan of $50.0 million, (iii) a tranche B-2 term loan of up to $75.0 million, (iv) a tranche C-1 term loan of up to $50.0 million, and (v) a tranche C-2 term loan of up to $50.0 million (collectively, the Term Loans). The tranche A term loan was funded in December 2021. With the approval of ZORYVE cream 0.3% on July 29, 2022, the tranche B term loans were funded in August 2022. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan Agreement was $100.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively. 
In October 2024, we made a 2024 Partial Prepayment of $100.0 million, which reduced the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan Agreement to $100.0 million. In connection with the 2024 Partial Prepayment, we are obligated to pay a prepayment penalty of $1.0 million by June 30, 2026 and a final fee of $6.95 million, representing the final fee applicable to the amount of the 2024 Partial Prepayment, on January 1, 2027. As a result of such 2024 Partial Prepayment, subject us generating a minimum net product revenue for the trailing six (6) month period ending as of the month prior to the borrowing date equal to 80% of our projected net product revenue as set forth in its annual plan for the respective period, we will be able to draw down the tranche C-1 and tranche C-2 term loans. The tranche C-1 term loan availability will expire on March 31, 2026 and the tranche C-2 term loan availability will expire on June 30, 2026. In addition, as a result of the 2024 Partial Prepayment, (i) the maturity date of the Loan Agreement is August 1, 2029 (such date, the Maturity Date), (ii) the applicable per annum interest rate is equal to 5.95% plus the greater of (a) 2.50% per annum and (b) the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), (iii) we are no longer subject to certain cost and purchase price restrictions regarding acquisitions, and (iv) we may prepay principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to a prepayment premium of (a) 3.0% for any prepayment made prior to the first anniversary of the second amendment, (b) 2.0% for any prepayment made prior after the first anniversary of the second amendment and prior to the second anniversary of the second amendment, or (c) 1.0% for any prepayment made prior after the second anniversary of the second amendment and prior to the Maturity Date.
Principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans will generally accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the applicable rate in effect from time to time, as determined by SLR on the third business day prior to the funding date of the applicable Term Loan and on the first business day of the month prior to each payment date of each Term Loan. Prior to the 2024 Partial Prepayment, the applicable rate was a per annum interest rate equal to 7.45% plus the greater of (a) 0.10% and (b) the one-month SOFR. As a result of such 2024 Partial Prepayment, the applicable interest rate will be a per annum interest rate equal to 5.95% plus the greater of (a) 2.50% and (b) the one-month SOFR. On December 31, 2024, the rate was 10.47%. The benchmark SOFR is subject to change in the event of certain events with respect to the benchmark rate. Interest payments are payable monthly following the funding of any Term Loan. Any principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans, if not repaid or prepaid, are due and payable on August 1, 2029. 
As security for the obligations under the Loan Agreement, we granted SLR, for the benefit of the lenders, a continuing security interest in substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions.
If the Term Loans are accelerated due to, among others, the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event, we are required to make certain mandatory prepayments of (i) all principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date, (ii) any fees applicable by reason of such prepayment, (iii) the prepayment premiums set forth in the paragraph above, plus (iv) all other obligations that are due and payable, including expenses and interest at the Default Rate (as defined below) with respect to any past due amounts.
The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, requirements as to financial reporting and insurance and restrictions

on our ability to dispose of our business or property, to change our line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on our property, to pay any dividends or other distributions on capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock or to redeem capital stock. We also agreed to a financial covenant whereby we must generate a minimum net product revenue equal to 75% of our projected net product revenue as set forth in our annual plan for the respective period, tested on a trailing six-month basis as of the end of each month. Each annual plan shall be approved by our board of directors and SLR, in its capacity as collateral agent, in its reasonable discretion. Any failure by us to deliver such annual plan on or before December 15 of the prior year shall be an immediate event of default.
In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the lenders to cause any indebtedness under the Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable, and to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the Term Loans. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, an additional default interest rate (the Default Rate) equal to 4.0% per annum will apply to all obligations owed under the Loan Agreement.
In connection with the Loan Agreement, we are obligated to pay (i) a final fee equal to 6.95% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loans outstanding as of the date of the second amendment, (x) with respect to any 2024 Partial Prepayment, upon the earliest to occur of (A) January 1, 2027, (B) the acceleration of all outstanding Term Loans and (C) the prepayment, or refinancing, substitution or replacement of all outstanding Term Loans, and (y) with respect to the Term Loans outstanding as of the date of the second amendment (other than 2024 Partial Prepayment), upon the earliest to occur of (A) the Maturity Date, (B) the acceleration of all outstanding Term Loans and (C) the prepayment, or refinancing, substitution or replacement of all outstanding Term Loans, (ii) a 2.00% fee with respect to tranche C term loans, due and payable on the earliest to occur of (A) the Maturity Date, (B) the acceleration of all outstanding Term Loans and (C) the prepayment, or refinancing, substitution or replacement of all outstanding Term Loans, (iii) a 2.00% extension fee with respect to tranche C term loans which remain unfunded after December 31, 2025, which shall accrue during the period commencing January 1, 2026, and ending on the earliest to occur of (A) the expiration of the tranche C term loan availability, and (B) the date on which tranche C term loan is fully drawn, and (iv) a certain amount of lenders’ expenses incurred in connection with the execution of the Loan Agreement. Additionally, in connection with the original Prior Loan Agreement, we previously had entered into an Exit Fee Agreement, whereby we agreed to pay an exit fee in the amount of 3.0% of each Term Loan funded upon (i) any change of control transaction or (ii) a revenue milestone, calculated on a trailing six-month basis. Notwithstanding the prepayment or termination of the Term Loan, the exit fee will expire 10 years from the date of the Loan Agreement.
We were in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024.

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities
The following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024:
Facility Operating Lease
We lease a facility in Westlake Village, California under an operating lease that commenced in February 2019 and was amended in April 2020 in order to relocate to a new expanded space. The total commitment under the operating lease agreement is $3.8 million, including $1.0 million for each of the years 2025 and 2026, $1.1 million for the year 2027, and $0.7 million for the year 2028. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Long-Term Debt Obligations 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million outstanding under our Loan Agreement. See Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The undiscounted future payments of principal and interest under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024 is $171.3 million, including $12.4 million for the year 2025, $13.6 million for the year 2026, $19.0 million for the year 2027, $12.2 million for the year 2028, and $114.1 million for the year 2029.
License Agreements & Acquisition
The terms of certain of our license agreements and our acquisition of Ducentis require us to pay potential future milestone payments based on product development and commercial success. The amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain. These
 potential obligations are further described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
Manufacturing Agreements
We have entered into manufacturing supply agreements for the commercial supply of ZORYVE, which include certain minimum purchase commitments. Firm future purchase commitments under these agreements are approximately $7.5 million for 2025, and approximately $0.9 million per year for 2026 and 2027. This amount does not represent all of our anticipated purchases, but instead represents only the contractually obligated minimum purchases or firm commitments of non-cancelable minimum amounts.

Indemnification
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations.
In accordance with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, we have indemnification obligations to our officers and directors for specified events or occurrences, subject to some limits, while they are serving at our request in such capacities. There have been no claims to date, and we have director and officer insurance that may enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future potential claims.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Nonclinical and Clinical Accruals and Costs
We record accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of nonclinical studies, clinical studies, clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other research and development projects. We accrue for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with third-party service providers under the service agreements. As it relates to clinical trials, the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Such payments are evaluated for current or long-term classification based on when they will be realized. Additionally, if expectations change such that we do not expect goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, such prepayments are charged to expense. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate expense in our consolidated financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which the services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial utilizing financial models taking into consideration discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers. In this manner, our clinical trial accrual is dependent in part upon the timely and accurate reporting of progress and efforts incurred from CROs, contract manufacturers and other third-party vendors. Although we expect our estimates to be materially consistent with actual amounts incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our 
109

Statement
s
accrued liabilities. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and actual costs incurred.
Revenues
Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(ASC 606), we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. We record the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.
We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that we transfer to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, we review the contract to determine which performance obligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. 
Product Revenue, Net
We sell our product to our Customers in the United States and Canada. Our Customers subsequently resell the products to pharmacies, health care providers, and patients. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize net product revenues from sales when the Customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to the Customer. Our payment terms are generally between 30 - 65 days.
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or “transaction price,” which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivables, net if payable to a Customer or accrued liabilities if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, we utilize the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Distribution Service Fees
: We engage with wholesalers to distribute our products to end customers. We pay the wholesalers a fee for services such as: data reporting, inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitment. We estimate the amount of distribution services fees to be paid to the Customers and adjust the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the Customer.
Prompt Pay Discounts
: We provide our Customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the Customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. We estimate the probability of Customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the agreement, and deduct the full amount of these discounts from its gross product revenues and accounts receivable at the time such revenues are recognized.
110
Table of Contents
Index to Financial 
Statement
s
Product Returns
: We provide Customers a return credit in the amount of the purchase price paid by Customers for all products returned in accordance with our returned goods policy.  Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. We do not record a right-of-return asset.
 In the early product launch period, we estimated a provision for sales returns based on industry data and adjusted the transaction price for such estimates at the time of sale to the Customer. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, we had collected history for our actual product returns, which we utilized to refine our returns rate and adjust our accrual.  This analysis resulted in a $4.1 million reduction in our accrual and favorable true-up impact to product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to prior period estimates.  We will continue to monitor our actual returns and if they vary from estimates, we may need to adjust accruals and reserve rates, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.  
Chargeback
: A chargeback is the difference between the manufacturer's invoice price to the wholesaler and the wholesaler’s customer's contract price. The wholesaler tracks these sales and "charges back" the manufacturer for the difference between the negotiated prices paid between the wholesaler's customers and wholesaler's acquisition cost. We estimate the percentage of goods sold that are eligible for chargeback and adjust the transaction price for such discount at the time of sale to the Customer.
Co-payment Assistance
: Patients who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. We recognize contra-revenue expense, and adjusts the transaction price for, co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
Rebates and Discounts:
 We accrue rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with private payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the United States. Our estimates for expected utilization of private payer rebates are based on data received from our customers. Our estimates for rebates under government programs are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $71.3 million, restricted cash of $0.6 million and marketable securities of $156.6 million, which consist of bank deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, and corporate debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. Because our investments are primarily short-term in duration, we believe that this exposure to interest rate risk is not significant, and a 1% movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio. 
111
Table of Contents
Index to Financial 
Statement
s
In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million outstanding under our Loan Agreement. Amounts outstanding under our Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal a per annum interest rate equal to 5.95% plus the greater of (a) 2.50% and (b) the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The benchmark SOFR is subject to change in the event of certain events with respect to the benchmark rate.  As a result, we are exposed to risks related to our indebtedness from changes in interest rates.  Based on the amount outstanding under our Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024, for every 100 basis point increase in the interest rates, we would incur approximately $1.0 million of additional annual interest expense. We do not currently engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, but higher interest expense would be offset in part by higher earnings on our cash and marketable securities. We may in the future use swaps, caps, collars, structured collars or other common derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk. It is difficult to predict the effect that future hedging activities would have on our operating results.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our Canadian subsidiary operates with the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. The majority of our transactions occur in U.S. dollars. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar affects the reported amounts of expenses, assets and liabilities. If we expand our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will increase. At December 31, 2024 we had cash balances denominated in Canadian dollars of $4.4 million. We currently do not hedge any foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such required information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Inherent Limitations over Controls and Procedures
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based our assessment on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc.’s (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Sales deductions
Description of 
the Matter
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded accrued sales deductions of $38.4 million. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from product sales are recognized net of variable consideration for invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, product returns and costs of co-pay assistance programs, which are collectively recorded at the time of sale. 
Auditing the accrued liabilities related to private payer rebates required significant judgment. The accrued sales deductions related to private payer rebates are based on data received from its customers, current contractual arrangements, market events and trends, external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns and patient utilization. Auditing the Company’s accounting for accrued sales deductions related to co-pay assistance programs requires a higher degree of judgment to evaluate the relevance and reliability of audit evidence. The accrued sales deductions related to co-pay assistance programs are estimated based on historical program payments and utilization. 
How We
Addressed the 
Matter in Our
Audit
To test the adequacy of the Company’s accrued sales deductions for private payer rebates and co-pay assistance we obtained management’s calculations for the estimates and performed the following procedures, among others. For accrued private payer rebates, we tested management’s estimation process by developing an independent expectation of the estimated accrual balance based upon actual historical payment data. We also tested terms and conditions for a sample of contracts to the executed agreement and tested a sample of payments made throughout the year. For accrued co-pay assistance programs, we assessed the company’s assumptions of distributor inventory quantities by agreeing the quantities to third party reports.  We also assessed the historical share and payment rate assumptions by testing a sample of the historical payments and program utilization.

1. 
Organization and Description of Business
Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or the Company, is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for dermatological diseases with high unmet medical needs. The Company’s strategy is to focus on validated biological targets and to use its drug development platform and deep dermatology expertise to develop differentiated products that have the potential to address the major shortcomings of existing therapies in its targeted indications.
The Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its first product, ZORYVE
®
 (roflumilast) cream 0.3% (ZORYVE cream 0.3%), on July 29, 2022, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous psoriasis, in individuals 12 years of age and older (subsequently approved down to 6 years old), and began U.S. commercialization in August 2022. The Company also received Health Canada approval of ZORYVE cream in plaque psoriasis on April 28, 2023 and began Canadian commercialization in June 2023. The Company received FDA approval of ZORYVE
®
 (roflumilast) topical foam 0.3% (ZORYVE foam), on December 15, 2023, for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in individuals 9 years of age and older, and began U.S. commercialization in late January 2024. The Company received FDA approval of ZORYVE
®
 (roflumilast) cream 0.15%, (ZORYVE cream 0.15%) on July 9, 2024, for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, and began U.S. commercialization in late July 2024. The Company received Health Canada approval of ZORYVE foam in October 2024.  
Initial Public Offering and Follow-On Financings
On February 4, 2020, the Company closed an initial public offering (IPO) issuing and selling shares of common stock receiving aggregate net proceeds of approximately $
167.2
 million. The Company completed subsequent public sales of its common stock in October 2020, February 2021 and August 2022, receiving aggregate net proceeds of $
93.4
 million, $
207.5
 million, and $
161.6
 million, respectively. 
In addition to the sale of common stock, the offering completed in October 2023 consisted of prefunded warrants to purchase 
7,500,000
 shares of the Company's common stock at $
2.4999
 per underlying share of common stock. The exercise price of the warrants is $
0.0001
 per underlying share of common stock. The prefunded warrants are exercisable at any time on or after their original issuance, and were not exercised as of December 31, 2024. 
On February 28, 2024, the Company completed an offering relating to the sale of 
15,789,474
 shares of the Company's common stock at $
9.50
 per share. The Company also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 
2,368,421
 shares at $
9.50
 per share, which the underwriters exercised in full on February 29, 2024. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company was $
161.7
 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 
At-the-Market (ATM) Offerings
On May 6, 2021, the Company entered into a sales agreement (Sales Agreement) with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen), under which the Company may from time to time issue and sell shares of its common stock through ATM offerings for an aggregate offering price of up to $
100.0
 million. Cowen will act as the Company's sales agent for the ATM program and is entitled to compensation for its services equal to 
3
% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. In March, 2022, the Company sold 
882,353
 shares under the ATM for $
17.00
 per share and received $
14.5
 million in net proceeds. In December 2023, the Company sold 
1,250,000
 shares under the ATM for $
2.60
 per share and received $
3.1
 million in net proceeds. 
In January 2024, the Company amended and restated its Sales Agreement with Cowen to reset the ATM program to provide for the offer and sale of shares of common stock having an aggregate gross offering price of up to $
100.0
 million.  All other terms of the amended and restated Sales Agreement are substantially the same as the original Sales Agreement. The Company has not yet issued or sold any common stock under the amended and restated Sales Agreement.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Liquidity
The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and had an accumulated deficit of $
1,121.9
 million and $
981.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management expects to continue to incur operating losses. The Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $
228.6
 million and $
272.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has $
100.0
 million outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024. See Note 9. 
The Company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the projected operating requirements for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of its financial statements. If the Company's available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated future cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy its liquidity requirements, the Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations. No assurance can be given as to whether additional needed financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, the Company may be required to curtail certain planned activities. Failure to manage discretionary spending or raise additional funds, as needed, may adversely impact the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives and have an adverse effect on its results of operations and future prospects.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates such estimates and assumptions for continued reasonableness. In particular, management makes estimates with respect to revenue recognition, accruals for research and development activities, stock-based compensation expense, and income taxes. Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  See below for change in prior period estimates related to revenue recognition which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, and short-term corporate debt securities.
Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held $
0.6
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively, of restricted cash as collateral for a letter of credit related to the Company's amended office space lease.
 See Note 8.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of investment grade short to intermediate-term fixed income investments that have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at estimated fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models for similar securities. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in fixed income securities at the time of purchase. Available-for-sale securities with original maturities beyond three months at the date of purchase, including those that have maturity dates beyond one year from the balance sheet date, are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets due to their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations. 
F-8
Table of Contents
ARCUTIS BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses as well as credit losses, if any, on marketable securities are included in other income, net. Interest on marketable securities is included in other income, net. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers during the period. To date, 
no
 such credit losses have occurred or have been recorded. The cost of investments sold is based on the specific-identification method.
Trade Receivables, net
The Company’s trade accounts receivable consists of amounts due primarily from pharmaceutical wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers in the United States and Canada (collectively, its Customers) related to sales of ZORYVE and have standard payment terms. For certain Customers, the trade accounts receivable for the Customer is net of distribution service fees, prompt pay discounts, and other adjustments. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its Customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company will reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated credit losses that may arise and any amounts determined to be uncollectible will be written off against the reserve when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. The reserve amount for estimated losses was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Inventory
The Company values its inventories at the lower-of-cost or net realizable value. The Company determines the cost of its inventories, which includes costs related to products held for sale in the ordinary course of business, products in process of production for such sale, and items to be currently consumed in the production of goods to be available for sale, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Due to the nature of the Company’s supply chain process, inventory that is owned by the Company is physically stored at third-party warehouses, logistics providers, and contract manufacturers. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. If they occur, such charges are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Products that may be used in clinical development programs are excluded from inventory and their costs are charged to research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations as incurred, as long as they do not have an alternative use. Prior to the initial dates of regulatory approval, costs related to the production of inventory were recorded as research and development expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in the period incurred.
Intangible Assets, net
The Company paid a milestone payment of $
7.5
 million to AstraZeneca in the third quarter of 2022 related to the FDA approval and launch of ZORYVE cream 0.3%. This milestone payment was capitalized as an intangible asset and will be amortized to cost of sales over its useful life of 
10
 years from the date of first commercial sale, as this is the minimum amount of time that the related License Agreement will be in effect. The Company paid an additional milestone payment of $
5.0
 million related to the achievement of $
100.0
 million worldwide net sales in the third quarter of 2024. This milestone payment was recorded as a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the carrying value of the intangible asset. 
 Amortization expense was $
2.0
 million, $
0.8
 million, and $
0.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, 
respectively. See Note 7. 
Estimated future amortization expense for the intangible assets subsequent to December 31, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be fully recoverable. To do so, the Company compares the carrying value of the intangible asset to the undiscounted net cash flows over its remaining useful life, and if not recoverable, will estimate the fair value of the asset. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.
Valuation of Other Investments
The Company reviews agreements it enters into with third-party entities, pursuant to which the Company may have a variable interest in the entity, in order to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). If the entity is a VIE, the Company assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of that entity. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of an entity, the Company applies a qualitative approach that determines whether it has both (i) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. If the Company determines it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it consolidates that VIE into the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company’s determination about whether it should consolidate such VIEs is made continuously as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in a consolidation or deconsolidation event. The Company currently does not consolidate any VIEs.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by either the financial institutions holding its cash or by its customers owing trade receivables to the extent recorded on the consolidated

balance sheets. To manage accounts receivable credit risk, the Company continuously evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and the need for an allowance for potential credit losses.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company’s financial instruments, in addition to those presented in Note 4, include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and long-term debt. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. As the long-term debt is subject to variable interest rates that are based on market rates which regularly reset, the Company believes that the carrying value of the long-term debt approximates its fair value.
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:
F-10
Table of Contents
ARCUTIS BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Level 1—Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from 
two
 to 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying values of its property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
 There were 
no
 impairments recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The classification of the Company’s leases as operating or finance leases, along with the initial measurement and recognition of the associated ROU assets and lease liabilities, is performed at the lease commencement date. The measurement of lease liabilities is based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments when its leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The ROU asset is based on the measurement of the lease liability, includes any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement and is adjusted for lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. Lease expense for the Company’s operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company considers a lease term to be the non-cancelable period that it has the right to use the underlying asset, including any periods where it is reasonably assured the Company will exercise the option to extend the contract. Periods covered by an option to extend are included in the lease term if the lessor controls the exercise of that option.
The Company’s lease agreements includes lease and non-lease components and the Company has elected to not separate such components for all classes of assets. Further, the Company elected the short-term lease exception policy, permitting it to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to leases with terms of 12 months or less (short-term leases) for all classes of assets.

Accrued and Prepaid Nonclinical and Clinical Costs
The Company records accrued liabilities for estimated costs and prepaid costs for research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and contract manufacturing activities. These costs are a significant component of the Company’s research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers under the service agreements. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities and prepaid costs balances in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities.

Revenues
Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(ASC 606), the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services that it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. 
Product Revenue, Net
The Company sells its product to its Customers in the United States and Canada. The Company’s Customers subsequently resell the products to pharmacies, health care providers, and patients. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes net product revenue from sales when the Customers obtain control of the Company’s products, which typically occurs upon delivery to the Customer. The Company’s payment terms are generally between 
30
 - 
65
 days.
Revenue from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or “transaction price,” which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivables, net if payable to a Customer or accrued liabilities if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, the Company utilizes the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as the Company’s historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.  See below for change in prior period estimates related to revenue recognition which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Distribution Service Fees
: The Company engages with wholesalers and specialty pharmacies to distribute its products to end customers. The Company pays the wholesalers and certain specialty pharmacies a fee for 
F-12
Table of Contents
ARCUTIS BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
services such as: data reporting, inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitment. The Company estimates the amount of distribution services fees to be paid to the Customers and adjusts the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the Customer.
Prompt Pay Discounts
: The Company provides some of its Customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the Customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. The Company estimates the probability of Customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the purchase agreement between the two parties, and deducts the full amount of these discounts from its gross product revenue and accounts receivable at the time such revenue is recognized.
Product Returns
:  The Company provides Customers a return credit in the amount of the purchase price paid by Customers for all products returned in accordance with the Company’s returned goods policy.  Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. The Company does not record a right-of-return asset.
In the early product launch period, the Company estimated its provision for sales returns based on industry data and adjusted the transaction price for such estimates at the time of sale to the Customer. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company had collected history for its actual product returns, which it utilized to refine its estimated returns rate and adjust its accrual.  This analysis resulted in a $
4.1
 million reduction in its accrual and favorable true-up impact to product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to adjusting prior period estimates.  The Company will continue to monitor its actual returns and if they vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust accruals and reserve rates, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.  
Chargeback
: A chargeback is the difference between the manufacturer's invoice price to the wholesaler and the wholesaler’s customer's contract price. The wholesaler tracks these sales and "charges back" the manufacturer for the difference between the negotiated prices paid between the wholesaler's customers and wholesaler's acquisition cost. The Company estimates the percentage of goods sold that are eligible for chargeback and adjusts the transaction price for such discount at the time of sale to the Customer.
Co-payment Assistance
: Patients who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. The Company records contra-revenue for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
Rebates and Discounts:
 The Company accrues rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with private payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the United States. The Company's estimates for expected utilization of private payer rebates are based on data received from its customers. The Company's estimates for rebates under government programs are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data it has accumulated since product launch. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual rebates vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
Other Revenue
Other revenue is related to the Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement and Sato License Agreement. See Note 7. The Company evaluated the agreements with Huadong and Sato and determined that they are within the scope of ASC 606.  The Company applied the five-step model as required by ASC 606 to determine revenue recognition.
The nonrefundable upfront payments received in connection with the transfer of the license and related know-how to Huadong in September 2023 and to Sato in March 2024 were determined to be distinct performance obligations, and therefore were recognized in Other revenue. 
The Company evaluated whether the development and regulatory milestones are considered probable of being reached and determined that their achievement is highly dependent on factors outside of the Company’s control. Therefore, these payments are subject to significant revenue reversal and are therefore not included in the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each milestone and, if necessary, adjust its estimate of the overall transaction price and accordingly recognize 
F-13
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
the related revenue once the probability of significant reversal of revenue is low. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, and would be reported in Other revenue in the period of adjustment. 
The sales milestones and royalties will be recognized in Other revenue when the related sales occur.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of ZORYVE, including raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on the Company’s net product revenue, and amortization of certain intangible assets associated with ZORYVE. Cost of sales may also include period costs related to certain inventory warehouse and distribution operations and inventory adjustment charges. The Company began capitalizing inventory costs upon related FDA approval dates for each product. As a result, manufacturing and other inventory costs incurred prior to FDA approval were expensed and, therefore, are not included in cost of sales.
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, license fees, stock-based compensation expense, materials, supplies, and the cost of services provided by outside contractors. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods are received or services are rendered. Such payments are evaluated for current or long-term classification based on when they will be realized.
The Company has entered into, and may continue to enter into, license agreements to access and utilize certain technology. In each case, the Company evaluates if the license agreement results in the acquisition of an asset or a business. To date, none of the Company’s license agreements have been considered an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, contingent consideration is recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. The upfront payments to acquire such licenses, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval that do not meet the definition of a derivative, are immediately recognized as research and development expense when paid or become payable, provided there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation, and travel, and costs related to sales and marketing of ZORYVE. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of the Company's intellectual property, insurance, and professional services fees for auditing, tax, and general legal services.

Pre-funded Warrants
Pursuant to the Company’s offering relating to the sale of securities completed in October 2023, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase 
7,500,000
 shares of the Company's common stock at $
2.4999
 per underlying share of common stock. The warrants had an exercise price of $
0.0001
 per underlying share of common stock, were fully exercisable upon issuance, and have no expiration date. The shares underlying the pre-funded warrants, the exercise of which requires nominal consideration for the delivery of the shares of common stock, are included in weighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Note 1.
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for share-based payments at fair value. The fair value of stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For share-based awards that vest subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement, the fair value measurement date for such awards is the date of grant and the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period. For share-based awards that vest subject to a performance condition, the Company will recognize compensation cost for awards if and when the Company

Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
concludes that it is probable that the awards with a performance condition will be achieved on an accelerated attribution method. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not. Due to the Company’s historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, the net deferred tax assets for the United States have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The Company has an immaterial deferred tax asset related to foreign jurisdictions which is not offset by a valuation allowance.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities, based on the merits of the position. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit.
 To date, there have been 
no
 interest or penalties incurred in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries where the local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Adjustments for foreign currency translation adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The earnings or loss of these subsidiaries are translated in U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including prefunded warrants, without consideration for potential dilutive shares of common stock. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. Since the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive. Shares of common stock subject to repurchase are excluded from the weighted-average shares.
Co-promotion Agreement
I
n July 2024, the Company entered into a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (Kowa) to leverage Kowa's primary care sales force to exclusively market and promote ZORYVE to primary care practitioners and pediatricians for all FDA-approved indications until July 2029. The Company recognizes all revenue and Kowa receives a commission for the net sales attributed to Kowa, which is reflected in selling, general and administrative expense.
  For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from sales attributed to Kowa were immaterial and related commissions were immaterial.

License Agreements & Acquisition
Sato License Agreement
On February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Sato). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the Company grants to Sato an exclusive, sublicensable (under certain circumstances) license under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by the Company for Sato to develop, conduct medical affairs activities for, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit roflumilast formulations (the Licensed Products) for all therapeutic uses for certain dermatological indications in humans (the Field) in Japan (the Territory). 
The License Agreement sets forth each party’s respective obligations with respect to the development, medical affairs activities, manufacture and supply, and commercialization of the Licensed Products. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Sato will, at its expense, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, commercialize, and conduct medical affairs activities related to the Licensed Products in the Field in Japan, subject to certain of the Company’s approval and oversight rights.

Indemnification
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless, and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of the Company's Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company currently has directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that reduces its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes any potential loss exposure under these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.

Long-term debt
On December 22, 2021, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Prior Loan Agreement) with SLR Investment Corp. (SLR) and the lenders party thereto. The Prior Loan Agreement was amended and restated on January 10, 2023 (the AR Loan Agreement) to include Arcutis Canada, Inc. as a borrower and party. On November 1, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the AR Loan Agreement to, among others, (i) modify the financial covenant relating to minimum net product revenue, and (ii) include an additional minimum financing covenant. On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment to the AR Loan Agreement (the AR Loan Agreement, as amended by the first and second amendments, the Loan Agreement), which it determined to be a modification, to, among others, (i) permit, during the period commencing on October 7, 2024 and ending on December 15, 2024, an optional partial prepayment of term loans outstanding, subject to a 
1.0
% prepayment penalty (the 2024 Partial Prepayment), (ii) add the tranche C-1 and tranche C-2 term loans, and (iii) facilitate certain other changes, including with respect to the applicable interest rate and maturity date in the event of a 2024 Partial Prepayment. As security for the obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Company granted SLR, for the benefit of the lenders, a continuing security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets, including its intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. The term loan facility is comprised of (i) a tranche A term loan of $

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan Agreement was $
100.0
 million and $
200.0
 million, respectively. 
On October 8, 2024, the Company made a 2024 Partial Prepayment of $
100.0
 million, which reduced the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan Agreement to $
100.0
 million. In connection with the 2024 Partial Prepayment, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment penalty of $

 million by June 30, 2026 and a final fee of $
6.95
 million, representing the final fee applicable to the amount of the 2024 Partial Prepayment, on January 1, 2027.
As a result of such 2024 Partial Prepayment, subject to the Company generating a minimum net product revenue for the trailing six (
6
) month period ending as of the month prior to the borrowing date equal to 
80
% of the Company’s projected net product revenue as set forth in its annual plan for the respective period, the Company will be able to draw down the tranche C-1 and tranche C-2 term loans. The tranche C-1 term loan availability will expire on March 31, 2026 and the tranche C-2 term loan availability will expire on June 30, 2026. In addition, as a result of the 2024 Partial Prepayment, (i) the maturity date of the Loan Agreement is August 1, 2029, (ii) the applicable per annum interest rate is equal to 
5.95
% plus the greater of (a) 
2.50
% per annum and (b) the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), (iii) the Company is no longer subject to certain cost and purchase price restrictions regarding acquisitions, and (iv) the Company may prepay principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans in minimum increments of $
25.0
 million, subject to a prepayment premium of (a) 
3.0
% for any prepayment made prior to the first anniversary of the second amendment, (b) 
2.0
% for any prepayment made prior after the first anniversary of the second amendment and prior to the second anniversary of the second amendment, or (c) 
1.0
% for any prepayment made prior after the second anniversary of the second amendment and prior to the maturity date.
Principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans will accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the applicable rate in effect from time to time, as determined by SLR on the third business day prior to the funding date of the applicable Term Loan and on the first business day of the month prior to each payment date of each Term Loan. Prior to the 2024 Partial Prepayment, the applicable rate was a per annum interest rate equal to 
7.45
% plus the greater of (a) 
0.10
% and (b) the one-month SOFR. As a result of such 2024 Partial Prepayment, the applicable interest rate will be a per annum interest rate equal to

% plus the greater of (a) 
2.50
% and (b) the one-month SOFR. On December 31, 2024, the rate was

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
If the Term Loans are accelerated due to, among others, the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event, the Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of (i) all principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date, (ii) any fees applicable by reason of such prepayment, (iii) the prepayment premiums set forth in the paragraph above, plus (iv) all other obligations that are due and payable, including expenses and interest at the Default Rate (as defined below) with respect to any past due amounts.
The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, requirements as to financial reporting and insurance and restrictions on the Company’s ability to dispose of its business or property, to change its line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on its property, to pay any dividends or other distributions on capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock or to redeem capital stock. The Company also agreed to a financial covenant whereby the Company must generate a minimum net product revenue equal to 
75
% of its projected net product revenue as set forth in the Company's annual plan for the respective period, tested on a trailing 
six-month
 basis, as of the end of each month. Each annual plan shall be approved by the Company’s board of directors and SLR, in its capacity as collateral agent, in its reasonable discretion. Any failure by the Company to deliver such annual plan on or before December 15 of the prior year shall be an immediate event of default. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the lenders to cause any indebtedness under the Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable, and to exercise remedies against the Company and the collateral securing the Term Loans. Under the Loan Agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, the Company fails to make payments under the Loan Agreement, the Company breaches any of the covenants under the Loan Agreement, subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches, the lenders determine that a material adverse change has occurred, or the Company or the Company's assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, an additional default interest rate, or the Default Rate, equal to 
4.0
% per annum will apply to all obligations owed under the Loan Agreement. The prepayment upon default and other potential additional interest provisions under the Loan Agreement were determined to be a compound embedded derivative instrument to be bifurcated from the loan and accounted for as a separate liability for accounting purposes under the guidance in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. At the inception of the Loan Agreement, the fair value of the embedded derivative was determined to be immaterial. The embedded derivative instrument is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with any future changes in fair value reported in Other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a $
0.3
 million gain and $
0.8
 million loss, respectively, in Other income, net. No gain or loss was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the embedded derivative instrument as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was a liability of $
0.6
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively, and is included in Other-long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4.

In addition, the 2020 Plan reserve will increase on January 1 of each year beginning in 2021 through 2030, by an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 
four
 percent of the shares of stock outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the day immediately prior to the date of increase and (b) such smaller number of shares of stock as determined by the Company's board of directors; provided, however, that no more than 
11,000,000
 shares of stock may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options. Accordingly, on January 1, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the 2020 Plan reserve increased by 
4,713,921
, 
3,871,494
, and 
2,442,090
 shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
3,126,304
 shares available for future grant under the 2020 Plan.

The 2020 Plan provides for the Company to sell or issue common stock or restricted common stock, or to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options for the purchase of common stock, to employees, members of the board of directors, and consultants of the Company under terms and provisions established by the board of directors. Under the terms of the 2020 Plan, options may be granted at an exercise price not less than fair market value. The Company generally grants stock-based awards with service conditions. Options granted typically vest over a 
four-year
 period but may be granted with different vesting terms.
Following the Company’s IPO and in connection with the effectiveness of the Company’s 2020 Plan, the 2017 Plan terminated and no further awards will be granted under that plan. However, all outstanding awards under the 2017 Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms.
In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors approved the 2022 Employment Inducement Incentive Plan (2022 Plan). The 2022 Plan initially reserved 
1,250,000
 shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation

rights, restricted stock awards, RSU awards, and other stock-based awards. In November 2022, the 2022 Plan reserve was increased by 
1,500,000
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
401,134
 shares available for future grant under the 2022 Plan.
Stock Option Exchange Program
On January 16, 2024, the Company commenced an offer to certain eligible employees and consultants to exchange certain outstanding eligible options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for a lesser number of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards pursuant to an option exchange program (the Option Exchange). The Option Exchange expired on February 12, 2024. Pursuant to the Option Exchange, eligible option holders elected to exchange, and the Company accepted for cancellation, eligible options to purchase an aggregate of 
5,059,129
 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 
98
% of the total shares of common stock underlying the eligible options. On February 13, 2024, immediately following the expiration of the Option Exchange, the Company granted 
2,129,594
 shares of Replacement RSU Awards, pursuant to the terms of the Option Exchange. The Replacement RSU Awards will vest based on continued service with the Company over a period of either 
1
, 
2
 or 
3
 years, depending on the grant date of the exchanged options.
The exchange of stock options was treated as a modification for accounting purposes, which requires an incremental expense of $
8.6
 million to be recognized for the Replacement RSU Awards over their new service periods (
1
 - 
3
 years). In addition, any unamortized expense remaining on the exchanged options as of the modification will be recognized over their original remaining service period.

2.2
 years. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
35.3
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that are expected to vest, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.4
 years.
In April 2024, in connection with the retirement of the former Chief Financial Officer, the Company modified the terms of this individual's historical stock awards. As a result of the modifications, the Company recognized $
1.7
 million of incremental stock compensation expense during the period, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
In determining the fair value of the stock options granted, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment.
Fair value of common stock—
The Company uses its closing stock price as reported on Nasdaq on the grant date for the fair value of its stock.
Expected Term
—The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) to determine the expected term as it does not have sufficient prior exercise data to calculate based on historical data.
Expected Volatility
— The Company uses its own historical stock price for expected volatility. 
Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
Dividend Yield
—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, which became effective on January 30, 2020 in connection with the IPO. The ESPP is designed to allow the Company’s eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, at semi-annual intervals, with their accumulated payroll deductions. Under the ESPP, participants are offered the option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount during a series of successive offering periods. The option purchase price will be the lower of 
85
% of the closing trading price per share of the Company’s common stock on the first trading date of an offering period in which a participant is enrolled or 
85
% of the closing trading price per share on the purchase date, which will occur on the last trading day of each offering period. 
The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, as amended. The maximum number of the Company’s common stock which will be authorized for sale under the ESPP is equal to the sum of (a) 
351,000
 shares of common stock and (b) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2021 and ending in 2030, equal to the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the shares of common stock outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) such number of shares of common stock as determined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, no more than 
5,265,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock may be issued under the ESPP. Accordingly, on January 1, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the ESPP reserve increased by 
1,178,480
, 
967,873
, and 
610,522
 shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
1,842,720
 shares available for future grant under the ESPP.  
Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $
914,000
, $
942,000
, and $
880,000
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Due to the lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets for the United States have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The Company has an immaterial deferred tax asset related to foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $
40.1
 million and $
53.4
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company has NOL carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $
731.3
 million and $
624.1
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Of the federal NOLs, $
3.5
 million originated before the 2018 tax year and will expire beginning in 2036. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining $
727.8
 million of NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely and will be available to offset 80% of taxable income in future years. Of the $
624.1
 million in state net operating loss carryforwards, $
541.9
 million will begin to expire in 2027 and the remaining NOLs carry forward indefinitely. In addition, the Company has foreign NOL carry forwards of approximately $
13.7
 million as of December 31, 2024, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
21.2
 million and $
4.9
 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2037. The California research and development tax credit carryforwards are available indefinitely.
Federal and California tax laws impose significant restrictions on the utilization of NOL carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and 383. The Company believes it has had ownership changes in the past, and may have additional ownership changes in the future. These ownership changes could limit its ability to use all of its NOL carryforwards, credit carryforwards, or other tax attributes. 
The Inflation Reduction Act 2022 (IRA) which incorporates a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) was signed on August 16, 2022. The changes were effective for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT will require companies to compute two separate calculations for federal income tax purposes and pay

The Company does not expect that there will be a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. 
The Company files tax returns in the United States, state jurisdictions, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The tax years for 2016 and forward are subject to examination by the U.S. tax authorities and the tax years for 2016 and forward are subject to examination by the California tax authorities. Due to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits in the United States and state tax jurisdictions, all years effectively remain open. The Company is subject to examination by the tax authorities in Canada and the United Kingdom for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the present period.  
It is the Company's practice to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company has 
no
t recognized any interest or penalties related to income taxes.
