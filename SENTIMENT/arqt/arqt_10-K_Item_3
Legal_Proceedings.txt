These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in “Risk factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law.
You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

Summary of Risk Factors
    Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
•
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with three products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and could continue to incur losses, which, together with our limited history as a commercial-stage company, makes it difficult to assess our future viability;
•
Due to the recent commercialization of products approved for commercial sale, as well as our development strategy and continued development of our pipeline of product candidates, our capital requirements are difficult to predict and may change. We may require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital if or when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate certain operations or efforts;
•
Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our future operating results to fall below expectations;
•
Our estimated market opportunities are subject to numerous uncertainties and may prove to be inaccurate. If we have overestimated the size of our market opportunities, our future growth may be limited;
•
The terms of our loan and security agreement require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants, and place certain restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business;
•
The sales, marketing, and distribution of ZORYVE or any future approved products may be unsuccessful or less successful than anticipated; 
•
Our business is dependent on the successful commercialization of ZORYVE and the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our product candidates;
•
Even if our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers, or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success; 
•
If we are unable to achieve and maintain third-party payer coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for ZORYVE or any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered; 
•
Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates;
•
We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would prevent or delay commercialization of our product candidates and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business, and our results of operations;
•
Topline or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data;
•
Certain of the endpoints in our planned clinical trials rely on a subjective assessment of the effect of the product candidate in the subject by either the physician or subject, and may prove difficult to meet in subjects with more severe disease, which exposes us to a variety of risks for the successful completion of our clinical trials;
•
Enrollment and retention of subjects in clinical trials is expensive and time-consuming and may result in additional costs and delays in our product development activities, or in the failure of such activities;

s
•
Serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during the development of our product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization, increase our costs, or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our product candidates;
•
We may need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy, managing any growth, and retaining talent; 
•
If we are not successful in acquiring, developing, and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired;
•
We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting medical dermatological indications, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively;
•
Any collaboration arrangements that we have entered into or may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize future product candidates;
•
If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of ZORYVE or our current or future product candidates;
•
We rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture nonclinical, clinical, and commercial supplies of ZORYVE and our product candidates. The loss of these manufacturers or their sub-suppliers, or their failure to provide us with sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business; 
•
If our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing or other regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected;
•
We rely on third parties to conduct our nonclinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates;
•
Risks related to our intellectual property could materially adversely impact our business, competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations;
•
Risks related to government regulation of our industry and required approvals could materially adversely impact our business, competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations; and
•
Future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
