Our Mission: Improve Healthcare, One Senior at a Time
Alignment Healthcare was founded in 2013 with one mission: improve healthcare, one senior at a time. We pursue this mission by focusing on our core values:
•
always put the senior first;
•
support the doctor;
•
use data and technology to revolutionize care; and
•
act with a serving heart.
We created Alignment after our own families faced frustrating experiences within the fragmented healthcare system. Without an advocate to create an integrated, high quality healthcare experience for them, our loved ones were left to navigate a care delivery and insurance landscape fraught with confusion and complexity. Seniors across the country are systemically and disproportionately impacted by the lack of care coordination, transparency and clear information. Furthermore, they are disadvantaged by misaligned incentives that dominate today’s healthcare system. As one of our most vulnerable populations, seniors across America need and deserve better. We put our combined decades of healthcare experience to work to create the Alignment model, incorporating best practices learned over our years serving seniors. Through the combination of this experienced, mission-driven team with purpose-built technology, we have found a way to address the unmet health and wellness needs of seniors. We aim to bring this senior-first healthcare experience to millions in the United States, become the most trusted senior healthcare brand in the country, and ultimately “do well by doing good.” 
Alignment’s Virtuous Cycle is a Distinct Competitive Advantage
Our model is based on a flywheel concept, referred to as our “virtuous cycle,” which reflects our unique ability to manage healthcare expenditures while maintaining quality and member satisfaction — a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage. 
To execute upon this concept, we start by ingesting medical and demographic data through our proprietary AVA technology platform. AVA’s predictive algorithms provide unique insights into each member and identify those most at risk of an acute event. Our information-enabled care model is then combined with clinical engagement by our employed clinical teams known as Care Anywhere to improve healthcare outcomes for our members. For example, our high-touch clinical model proactively manages chronic conditions and assists with post-discharge care navigation to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions, which in turn improves health outcomes and quality while lowering overall costs. We then reinvest medical cost savings into richer coverage and benefits, which propels growth in revenue and membership while maintaining margin discipline. The strength of our model is further reinforced by delivering a premium member experience. Our concierge and a clinical service hotline is available 24/7 at no additional cost to our members and our state-of-the-art in-house call centers provide us with more consistency and control over member-facing functions. 
Our virtuous cycle, based on the principle of doing well by doing good, is highly repeatable and a core tenet of our ability to continue to expand in existing and new markets in the future. The five-year compounded growth rate through December 31, 2024 of revenue and the number of members enrolled in our HMO and PPO contracts ("Health Plan Membership") is 29% and 31%, respectively.
Our Results: Predictable, Recurring Revenue Positioned for Long-Term Growth
To achieve our mission of improving healthcare for one senior at a time, we have developed a business model with a predictable, recurring revenue stream that provides significant visibility into our financial growth trajectory. We generally contract directly with CMS as a licensed Medicare Advantage plan and receive a recurring per member per month (“PMPM”) payment in exchange for bearing the responsibility of our members’ healthcare outcomes and expenditures. These contractual arrangements, combined with the fact that the majority of our net membership growth occurs effective on January 1 of a calendar year after the annual enrollment period (“AEP”), provide a higher degree of visibility to our full-year projected revenue early in the calendar year, subject to our ability to model for in-year member growth, as well as revenue PMPM, which in turn depends on member health and mortality trends.
We believe that Medicare Advantage is unique in that it allows one entity to influence the entirety of a senior’s healthcare through a single, direct-to-consumer product. Our platform is designed to maximize the benefits of Medicare Advantage, with all stakeholders being rewarded as we improve the clinical outcomes and experience for our members. We believe that the outcomes below clearly demonstrate the success of our unique consumer-centric platform by delivering on the promise of our virtuous cycle.
Our ability to deliver lower healthcare costs while improving the consumer’s experience is a unique competitive advantage. In 2024, we achieved a net promoter score (NPS) for our Care Anywhere members of greater than 78 versus the industry average of 40 and had 98% of our members enrolled in a plan with a CMS star rating of 4 stars or above. From a clinical standpoint, we achieved a hospitalization rate of approximately 152 hospitalizations per every 1,000 at-risk members, which is approximately 39% lower than the 2019 Medicare FFS performance in our markets. This differentiation has led to our demonstrated ability to rapidly scale, as evidenced by the expansion

Table of Contents
of our model to 53 markets across five states covering approximately 209,900 Health Plan Members as of January 1, 2025 and more than 83% of gross sales sourced through plan switchers from a competing Medicare Advantage plan. We believe we have proven that our model is highly predictable and repeatable across different markets and will enable strong growth on a national level as we pursue our vision of becoming the most trusted senior healthcare brand in the country.
We anticipate further investments in our business as we expand into new markets and continue to offer additional innovative product offerings and supplemental benefits to attract new members.   
Our Technology: AVA
®
 Provides Timely and Actionable Insights
AVA empowers Alignment’s employees and provider partners with timely and actionable information to improve the health experience and outcomes of Alignment’s members.
Our position in the healthcare ecosystem as a Medicare Advantage plan affords us differentiated access to large amounts of member data. We applied our clinical and technical expertise to build AVA, a proprietary platform that forms the backbone of our care delivery efforts, whether done through provider partners or directly through our care teams. AVA is a highly sophisticated engine that ingests longitudinal data from more than 200 sources to provide an accurate assessment of each member and actionable information to care teams in real time. When triggered by relevant data, AVA delivers prescriptive insights that guide providers’ workflows to deliver personalized care to members. Examples of workflows include ordering a prescription, alerting a caregiver, transferring information from a lab to a doctor, and developing a treatment plan. 
We and our provider partners use this data every day to power care interventions that may be missed in traditional healthcare relationships. AVA improves the care outcomes and care experience of our members, while also providing everyone in their ecosystem — from doctors to nurses — real-time data and operational indicators to deliver the right care, to the right member at the right time.
AVA incorporates high security controls around member data, and it is subject to regular vulnerability tests and strict authorization protocols. It also uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to help predict various scenarios such as

hospital admission and re-admission risk, member satisfaction, disenrollment risk and various disease propensity scores and how to best intervene. These models are based on hundreds of thousands of historical outcomes, which have shaped their predictions and accuracy, and are constantly updated with new data sets, enabling them to get smarter and more effective. 
Additional details on AVA’s capabilities include: 
•
Consumer Experience
:
 AVA offers a digital ecosystem that enables our members and their support system to get the information and care they need, when and how they need it. With their AVA-powered member portal and mobile app, seniors have many self-service capabilities and can get 24/7 care, send secure messages to their concierge and care teams, check their rewards and ACCESS On-Demand Concierge Card balance, and view their health history, including medical claims history, pharmacy, and benefits data. 
•
Internal Care Delivery
:
 Our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver care via our internal care teams is critical to improving outcomes and managing costs. AVA is vital in our ability to identify and manage our highest risk, most complex members, and to ensure that every intervention opportunity is optimized by the most relevant and effective data available. 
•
External Providers
:
 AVA transforms care delivery by shifting the paradigm from “silos of care” to physicians and payors working together as partners through technology-enablement. Medical group leaders, doctors and front-line administrative staff are provided comprehensive information to streamline and support the coordination of member care. AVA provider applications drive workflows and action lists to improve member outcomes at a lower cost and lower visit frequency. Providers are given access to AVA applications to track utilization, gaps in clinical care, and health risk assessments. This data is utilized to prioritize which members to see, and which members may benefit from various health engagement strategies.
•
Health Plan Operations
:
 By leveraging a single source of accurate information, we foster improved cross-functional communication and execution across our key value drivers. With the support of AVA our operational leaders can make faster, data-driven decisions, which leads to improved outcomes and greater efficiencies as we grow our membership base.
•
Growth Operations
:
 We are able to create greater brand differentiation in the market with our external brokers and our internal sales team by providing them best-in-class digital solutions such as the AVA Broker Portal and mobile app. These tools streamline application submission and management, client management, commission tracking, and a variety of self-service capabilities specifically for Medicare Advantage.
When paired with our operational expertise, we believe AVA is integral to our ability to drive our operations and business outcomes consistently across markets. AVA provides us with the flexibility to adapt our operating models to meet the needs of local communities and providers, while achieving high-quality, low-cost care in each market. From driving workflows to enabling smarter interventions, we believe AVA is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to deliver information-enabled healthcare at scale.
Our Clinical Model: Proactively Managing Member Care to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Cost
5
Table of Contents
We engage regularly with members as part of their daily lives and proactively manage their chronic conditions to improve outcomes and reduce cost.
Our clinical model is designed specifically for seniors and is managed across multiple disciplines (medical, social, psychological, pharmaceutical and functional) and sites of care (home, inpatient, outpatient, virtual and others). Our internal care teams and external providers use AVA to coordinate high-quality care for members and manage the complexity of the healthcare system. Given the prevalence of comorbidities within our chronically ill members, coordination across a multi-disciplinary care team is vital to providing a medical and behavioral care plan that drives improved outcomes.
Our care delivery model creates a highly personalized experience that is unique to each member. Using insights from AVA, we organize members into four categories to provide optimized care: healthy, healthy utilizer, pre-chronic and chronic. The data below represents a sample of our population stratification from 2024.
Healthy
:
 The typical member in the “healthy” category requires low levels of medical care. Healthy members comprise approximately 71% of our membership base but account for only 5% of the institutional claims submitted.
Healthy Utilizer
:
 The typical member in the “healthy utilizer” category is an otherwise healthy senior who has had isolated or unexpected health challenges requiring significant medical care. Healthy utilizers comprise approximately 8% of our membership base and account for 16% of the institutional claims submitted.
Pre-Chronic
:
 The typical member in the “pre-chronic category” is identified as high-risk by AVA but has yet to incur significant healthcare expenditures. We also refer to these members as on the “launching pad,” and by deploying our targeted care programs towards this population we work to prevent or slow their increasing acuity levels. Pre-chronic members comprise approximately 8% of our membership but account for only 1% of the institutional claims submitted. Our active approach to monitoring gaps in care and acting before emerging health problems worsen is reflective of the culture of care embedded in our organization, and our focus on being a persistent advocate for our members.
Chronic
:
 The typical member in the “chronic” category is generally a complex patient with multiple chronic conditions in need of significant, coordinated care. Chronic members comprise 13% of our membership but account for 78% of the institutional claims submitted.
Care Anywhere: Proactive, Coordinated Care Delivers Results
While the majority of healthy and healthy utilizer members’ care needs are managed by our network of local community providers in conjunction with our support and oversight, our pre-chronic and chronic members are in our 
Care Anywhere
 program. 
Care Anywhere
 is an advanced clinician-driven model of care that is staffed by Alignment-employed physicians, advanced practice clinicians, case managers, social workers and behavioral health coaches to assure execution of cross-functional care plans. Unlike many managed care plans, we have built these services in-house to provide valuable, high-quality care to members for free, which complement the care provided by our provider partners for their most challenging and resource-intensive patients.
Key features of the 
Care Anywhere
 program include proactive outreach; 24/7 access; highly detailed personalized care plans; and enhanced coordination of care and social needs. Standardized care programs are targeted to seniors based on their underlying conditions, such as chronic heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, which are then personally tailored based on each individual’s underlying circumstances. We proactively engage with this high-risk group of seniors based on their preferences for care delivery, which is typically in their homes or through telephonic and video consultations. 
We believe, based on data gathered and analyzed using AVA, that our 
Care Anywhere
 program creates several benefits for our high-risk, complex members: improved quality of life, high patient satisfaction, reductions in unnecessary emergency room visits and inpatient care, and lower re-admission rates. This also allows us to establish a more direct relationship with seniors, building member loyalty and brand recognition. Our 
Care Anywhere
 program has an NPS score greater than 78, underscoring the positive impact it has on our most vulnerable members. 
Our collective investment in our care model and technology platform has produced strong clinical outcomes for our seniors. In 2024, we achieved a hospitalization rate of approximately 152 hospitalizations per every 1,000 at-risk members, which is approximately 39% lower than the 2019 Medicare FFS performance in our markets. Further, we have achieved approximately 152-159 inpatient admissions per thousand on our at-risk membership for the last seven years in a row, despite our significant membership growth over that period of time. 
Regulation
Our operations and those of our affiliated entities are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, reports to CMS, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records and quality assurance programs and patient care. The majority of our regulation and oversight comes from CMS, which regulates almost every aspect of our business, including our provider network, benefits, member enrollment, risk adjustment program, plan offerings, claims payments, quality improvement programs, and appeals and grievances. We 
6
Table of Contents
have entered into standard form agreements with CMS pursuant to Sections 1851 through 1859 and Sections 1860D-1 through 1860D-43 of the Social Security Act ("SSA"), pursuant to which we have agreed to operate our plans in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and CMS has agreed to make payments to us under the SSA. Each CMS contract has a one-year term expiring on December 31 of the applicable calendar year and is subject to annual one-year renewal terms. Under the contracts we are obligated to provide our members basic benefits and services covered by Part A and Part B of the original Medicare Program, any applicable supplemental benefits we elect to provide in our final benefit and price bid proposals approved by CMS, and prescription drugs. The CMS contracts further require us to develop our annual benefit and price bid proposals and submit to CMS all related information on premiums, benefits and cost sharing by no later than the first Monday in June prior to the commencement of the subsequent calendar year to which they apply, in accordance with the CMS regulations. Each CMS contract may be terminated by mutual consent or by CMS or by us for cause. We are required to accept new enrollments, make enrollments effective, process voluntary disenrollments and limit involuntary disenrollments in accordance with the CMS regulations. Generally, to enroll or remain enrolled in one of our Medicare Advantage plans, an individual must be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United States, be entitled to Medicare under Part A and enrolled in Part B, reside in the service area covered by the plan, complete and sign the required election forms to enroll and agree to abide by the rules of the Medicare Advantage plan into which he or she is enrolled or intends to enroll. Such agreements also provide for member and provider protections and marketing requirements, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements, all with reference to applicable laws and regulations. If any of our operations or those of our affiliated professional medical corporations are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, or if we otherwise fail to adhere to our contracts with CMS, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:
•
termination of one or more of our Medicare Advantage plans or contracts;
•
suspension of our marketing of and/or enrollment into our Medicare Advantage plans;
•
civil monetary penalties;
•
refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable Medicare Advantage requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;
•
loss of our required government certifications;
•
loss of our licenses required to operate our clinics and in-house care delivery programs;
•
criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the FCA and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or state analogs to these federal enforcement authorities, or other regulatory requirements;
•
enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their health information has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”), and their implementing regulations (collectively known as “HIPAA”)
•
mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses or decrease our revenue;
•
imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements, as well as increased scrutiny of our business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;
•
termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, including provider arrangements;
•
changes in and reinterpretation of rules and laws by a regulatory agency or court, such as state corporate practice of medicine laws, that could affect the structure and management of our business and our affiliated physician-owned professional medical groups;
•
negative adjustments to government payment models including, but not limited to, Parts A, B and D benefits; and
•
harm to our reputation, which could negatively impact our business relationships, our ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, our ability to obtain financing and our access to new business opportunities, among other things.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. See “
Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation.
”
In addition to the SSA, CMS regulations, and our contractual obligations, we must also comply with a variety of other laws:
HIPAA, HITECH Act and Other Laws, Rules and Regulations Related to Data Privacy; Security and Protection
We are subject to data privacy and protection and breach notification laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of protected health information (“PHI”), and other types of personal data or personally identifiable information (“PII”), which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy and security of such PII. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of

goodwill. Ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. 
The use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform healthcare provider, payer, and employer identifiers, and establishing regulations aimed at protecting confidentiality and security of patient and member data. The rules preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more privacy-protective. These regulations, in addition to other state laws, set standards for the security of electronic health information, including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their individually identifiable health information is used. 
The US Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights announced on December 27, 2024, and published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2025, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing extensive modifications to the HIPAA security standards. If finalized, these modifications and could entail significant additional compliance obligations and costs for HIPAA-regulated covered entities and business associates.
HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. In 2024, penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations started at $141 per violation and could not exceed approximately $71,162 per violation, subject to a cap of approximately $2.1 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. The penalty amounts listed above are also due for inflation adjustments in 2025.
HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for statutory damages of up to $25,000. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. 
In addition, the HITECH Act mandates that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA-regulated covered entities and business associates for compliance with HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of any civil monetary penalty fine paid by the violator. 
HIPAA further requires that members be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Breaches affecting more than 500 patients in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually. 
We also publish statements to our members and partners that describe how we handle and protect PHI. If federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants consider any portion of these statements to be untrue, we may be subject to claims of deceptive practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation, costs of responding to investigations, defending against litigation, settling claims, and complying with regulatory or court orders.
Data privacy and security at the state level remains an evolving landscape. For example, California’s California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, has since been amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023 and began enforcement on July 1, 2023.  The CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, expands on the existing rights provided to California residents and will include rights to know, delete, correct, personal information; limit the use of sensitive personal information; and opt out of the sale of personal information or the sharing of personal information with third parties for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.  There are also requirements for data processing and cybersecurity assessments, and contracting requirements for service providers, third parties, and contractors who receive and process information from the regulated “business.” The CPRA amendment created a state agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”), to enforce and implement the law. This agency will be able to finance operations through penalties issued and, with the CPRA’s removal of the mandatory cure period from the CCPA, we will have less warning before compliance risk results in legal action. Additionally, the CCPA’s exemption for personal information of personnel (including employees, job applicants, officers, and directors) and business-to-business contacts has been allowed to sunset.  As a result, beginning on January 1, 2023, personal information of California resident personnel and business contacts became subject to the CCPA. This has created compliance obligations for our operations. 
The CCPA and CPRA contain exemptions for medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, and for PHI collected by a covered entity or business associate governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rule established pursuant to HIPAA.  This exempts much of the data we process with respect to patients and plan members.
The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs

and/or changes in business practices and policies. For example, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which became effective January 1, 2023, gives Virginia residents expanded rights to access and creates additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and the Nevada Privacy Law, which became effective on October 1, 2019, requires businesses to give website users the option to opt-out of the sale of their data. State privacy laws also became effective in 2024 in Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Texas and have or will become effective in 2025 in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Maryland. These state laws generally exempt HIPAA regulated covered entities and business associates, PHI, and/or personal information collected in the context of employment and business-to-business relationships.
While the CPRA/CCPA is an example of consumer privacy law, the NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Model Law”) is a different type of law focused on securing insurance licensees’ information systems. Versions of this Model Law have been passed in many states and are expected to be passed in more states in the coming years.  Similar to HIPAA, the Model Law requires the implementation of technical, administrative, and physical information security practices and procedures and includes reporting requirements for data breaches.  These Model Laws are typically enforced by state insurance regulators. We are not currently subject to any of these laws that have been adopted to date.
It is possible that applicable laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with laws regarding privacy and security of PHI and other PII could expose us to penalties under such laws. Any such failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or other liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation.
As indicated above, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Substantially all of our relevant member data is maintained on our technology platform, AVA, which aggregates and provides us with access to extensive member datasets, including individually identifiable PHI. Violations of HIPAA or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations requires significant and ongoing systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. See “
Risk Factors
—
Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or our members, or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation
.”
Our business and operations may also be subject to federal, state, and local consumer protection laws governing marketing communications, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which places restrictions on the use of automated tools and technologies to communicate with wireless telephone subscribers or communications services consumers generally and the CAN-SPAM Act, which regulates the transmission of marketing emails.  In addition, certain of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), which is a multifaceted industry security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment brands and acquiring banks.
The Health Care Reform Law and Other Current or Future Legislative, Judicial or Regulatory Changes
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the “Health Care Reform Law”) enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. Some of these changes impact us and other entities that offer Medicare Advantage plans.  In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including the Comparative Effectiveness Research Fee to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Other Laws
As a corporate entity, we are not licensed to practice medicine. Many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals, and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians. Statutes, regulations and court decisions relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary widely from state to state. The laws and regulations in these areas are complex, changing, and often subject to varying interpretations. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. Under business support agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and associated physician-owned professional groups, these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions, as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers, developing operating policies and procedures, implementing professional standards and controls, and maintaining malpractice insurance.
We, our in-house and externally engaged physicians and the facilities in which they operate are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and accreditation standards and other laws, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, privacy of member information, physician relationships, personnel and operating policies and procedures.

Table of Contents
Failure to comply with these licensing, certification and accreditation laws, regulations and standards could result in prior payments being subject to recoupment, requirements to make significant changes to our operations and can give rise to civil or, in extreme cases, criminal penalties. We routinely take the steps we believe are necessary to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities.
In jurisdictions where the corporate practice of medicine is prohibited, we have historically operated by maintaining long-term business support services contracts with multiple associated professional medical entities that are wholly owned by physicians and, in turn, employ or contract with physicians to provide those professional medical services required by our members. Under these business support services agreements, our primary operating subsidiary performs only non-medical business support services, does not represent that it offers medical services and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the associated physician groups. In addition to the above business support services arrangements, we have certain contractual rights relating to the orderly transfer of equity interests in our associated physician practices through succession agreements and other arrangements with their physician equity holders. Such equity interests cannot, however, be transferred to or held by us or by any non-professional medical entity. Accordingly, neither we nor our direct subsidiaries directly own any equity interests in any of our associated physician practices.
Anti-Kickback, Physician Self-Referral and Other Fraud and Abuse Laws
A federal law commonly referred to as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of Medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities, or in return for the purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by Medicare or other federal governmental health programs. Because the prohibitions contained in the Anti-Kickback Statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part,” the Anti-Kickback Statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above. Violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits physicians, subject to certain exceptions described below, from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician, or an immediate family member, has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has entered into a compensation arrangement. These prohibitions, contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, commonly known as “Stark II,” amended prior federal physician self-referral legislation known as “Stark I” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories. The professional groups with which we are contracted or affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services. Persons or entities found to be in violation of the Stark Law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
A federal law commonly referred to as the “False Claims Act” prohibits the submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. 
Qui tam 
relators and/or the government may take the position that we submit certain data or information that could form the basis of a claim for payment, thus subjecting us to allegations under the False Claims Act.  In such events, we could be subject to treble damages and per-claim penalties.
Many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the Anti-Kickback Statute and, in more limited instances, the Stark Law, that are not limited to services for which Medicare or Medicaid payment is made. In addition, most states have statutes, regulations, or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals. These laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. In states that have enacted these statutes, we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law as persuasive.
State Regulation of Insurance-Related Products
Laws in each of the states in which we operate our business license and regulate entities that offer health plans to residents of that state. The products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators. However, for entities offering Medicare Advantage plans, federal law preempts all state laws and regulations except those relating to licensing and financial solvency.
Certain of our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports. The amount of dividends that may be paid to us by these insurance subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements. We continue to maintain our levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Dividends from our non-insurance companies are generally not restricted by departments of insurance. See “

Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and critical to our business stability and growth. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how license agreements and confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
We do not have any issued patents with respect to our AVA platform, and we are not currently pursuing any patent applications. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. 
Competition
The U.S. healthcare insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, HMOs and PPOs. Many of our competitors have a larger membership base and/or greater financial resources than we do. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare Advantage program or competitors in the delivery of healthcare services. We believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of our products are generally tied to an annual bidding process with CMS. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price and Star ratings will continue to be significant bases of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling healthcare costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. The primary competitive factors for our industry include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
premium price;
•
Star ratings;
•
breadth and richness of benefits, such as maximum out-of-pocket, deductibles, co-pays, Part B rebates, in addition to others;
•
diversity of services and products offered, particularly ones that address the social determinants of health;
•
breadth of network access;
•
level of member engagement;
•
level of member satisfaction;
•
the quality of the member experience provided, including member service;
•
care delivery and health outcomes;
•
costs of care;
•
ability to recruit and retain skilled employees and clinicians;
•
brand identity and reputation; and
•
regulatory compliance

In 2022, we released our inaugural ESG report and created an ESG Steering Committee comprised of cross-functional leaders representing every department within the Company. Our aim is to continue fortifying each pillar and to operate with transparency in a way that always puts seniors first, and respects all people, communities, conditions, and environments.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We are focused on building a company that is transforming health care by putting seniors first, and our employees are critical to our success. Our Human Capital strategy focuses on meeting business objectives by attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining a high-performing, diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,679 full-time employees in addition to seasonal employees who assist with the Medicare AEP.
Each year, we conduct an employee survey to further enhance employee engagement and productivity. We also implement rigorous employee training protocols to help ensure our teams operate with rigor, ethics and compliance in mind. 
We recognize that an inclusive workplace is crucial as we scale and build our high-performing team. All aspects of our inclusive culture  continue to be embedded in each aspect of our processes, programs, and structures that drive our talent lifecycle: attraction, recruitment, onboarding, development, and retention efforts. Our efforts to recruit for excellence are reflected in the composition of our current employee workforce and Board of Directors, which are comprised of a diverse group of highly qualified individuals that represent top talent in the industry. As of December 31, 2024:
•
74% of our employees were female;

20% of our executive team was ethnically diverse;

44% of our Board of Directors was female.  
The future success of our company will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, develop and retain the best talent as we grow and scale the organization. Our talent acquisition and management strategies are designed to ensure that we create and develop a pipeline of outstanding physicians, clinical employees, and business leaders. A key component of our corporate sustainability and success is learning and development. We are intentional in our efforts to provide all employees opportunities to grow. Our training and development programs for employees focus on enhancing and developing talent within the company. All of our employees can access the training of their choice on-demand through our learning and development platform. We are currently designing additional training programs and resources for both new hires and longer-tenured employees that will educate them on critical functional areas of within the organization.
Our compensation and incentive plans are designed to attract, retain, and reward employees by granting cash-based performance and stock-based awards. By motivating individuals to achieve business objectives and perform to the best of their abilities, they support the success of the company and the increase of stockholder value. We also provide comprehensive medical benefits, a positive work/life balance, generous paid time off, and health and wellness programs. We regularly evaluate each aspect of compensation and benefits to ensure they align with the market and our peers.
Our current workforce model embraces working in a hybrid-remote fashion. Our workforce strategy enhances our ability to attract the best talent nationally, allowing us to serve our members where they live and continue to provide our employees with a healthy work-life balance.
Our board of directors believes that human capital management is an essential component of our continued growth and success. Management regularly reports to our board for input on important decisions related to human capital, including corporate culture, safety, compliance, talent management, organizational development, compensation, and benefits.
