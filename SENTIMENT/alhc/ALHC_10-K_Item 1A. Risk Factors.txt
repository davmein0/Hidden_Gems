Overview
Alignment is a next generation, consumer-centric platform designed to improve the healthcare experience for seniors. We deliver this experience through our Medicare Advantage plans, which are customized to meet the needs of a diverse array of seniors. Our innovative model of consumer-centric healthcare is purpose-built to provide seniors with care as it should be: high quality, low cost and accompanied by a vastly improved consumer experience. We combine a proprietary technology platform and a high-touch clinical model that enhances our members’ lifestyles and health outcomes while simultaneously controlling costs, which allows us to reinvest savings back into our platform and products to directly benefit the senior consumer.
Our model is based on a flywheel concept, referred to as our “virtuous cycle,” which reflects our unique ability to manage healthcare expenditures while maintaining quality and member satisfaction — a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage.   
To execute upon this concept, we start by ingesting medical and demographic data through our proprietary AVA technology platform. AVA’s predictive algorithms provide unique insights into each member and identify those most at risk of an acute event. Our information-enabled care model is then combined with clinical engagement by our employed clinical teams known as Care Anywhere to improve healthcare outcomes for our members. For example, our high-touch clinical model proactively manages chronic conditions and assists with post-discharge care navigation to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions, which in turn improves health outcomes and quality while lowering overall costs. We then reinvest medical cost savings into richer coverage and benefits, which propels growth in revenue and membership while maintaining margin discipline. The strength of our model is further reinforced by delivering a premium member experience. Our concierge and a clinical service hotline is available 24/7 at no additional cost to our members and our state-of-the-art in-house call centers provide us with more consistency and control over member-facing functions.   
Our virtuous cycle, based on the principle of doing well by doing good, is highly repeatable and a core tenet of our ability to continue to expand in existing and new markets in the future. The five-year compounded growth rate through December 31, 2024 of revenue and the number of members enrolled in our HMO and PPO contracts ("Health Plan Membership") is 29% and 31% respectively.
Medicare Advantage Background
Today, seniors are confronted with a healthcare landscape that is fragmented across disparate point solutions, tools and vendors, without an accessible, coordinated approach to comprehensive care delivery. Under the traditional Medicare fee-for-service ("FFS") model, seniors receive access to hospital insurance benefits (“Part A”) and outpatient services (“Part B”) directly from CMS. Original Medicare (Part A and B) does not include prescription drug coverage (“Part D”), and most seniors enrolled in original Medicare opt to obtain Part D and other protection for gaps in their coverage by purchasing costly Medicare supplement insurance plans. In contrast, Medicare Advantage plans are direct-to-consumer and provide a single point of care delivery for Part A, Part B and often Part D coverage. Medicare Advantage penetration of the Medicare market is rapidly increasing given the enhanced benefits and coverage that Medicare Advantage plans offer relative to traditional Medicare FFS. In 2024, approximately 54% of the Medicare eligible population, or approximately 33 million seniors, were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Industry projections have forecasted a continued increase in the Medicare Advantage penetration rate from approximately 54% to approximately 64% by 2033. 
Medicare Advantage allows one entity to influence the entirety of a senior’s healthcare through a singular, direct-to-consumer product. We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide health insurance coverage to Medicare eligible persons under HMO and PPO plans in exchange for a payment per member per month ("PMPM"). The PMPM payment varies based on geography, CMS Star ratings and certain population-specific risk factors. Under these value-based contracts, we assume the economic risk of funding our members’ healthcare, supplemental benefits and related administration costs. By transferring the economic risk to managed care companies like Alignment, CMS has enabled us to focus on proactive, cross-disciplinary care targeted at improving health outcomes and lowering unnecessary healthcare expenditures.
The Medicare Advantage regulatory framework is designed to reward plans that achieve the triple aim of high-quality care, low costs and better experience. CMS payments to Medicare Advantage plans are allocated in each county or region based on a bidding system. Each plan submits a bid based on its estimated costs per enrollee for services covered under Medicare Parts A and B. Plans that have a low enough cost structure to bid under the benchmark are entitled to rebates, which enable those plans to offer enhanced supplemental benefits and medical coverage to their members, which in turn boosts membership growth and therefore revenue. CMS further measures Medicare Advantage beneficiaries’ clinical outcomes and experience with their health plans and the healthcare system through a Five Star Quality Rating System. Medicare Advantage plans are eligible to receive additional economic incentives based on their Star rating.

Table of Contents
Due to the competitive nature of CMS’s bidding system, only those plans that are able to provide low cost and high-quality outcomes will be able to offer enhanced benefit options, which is critical to achieving sustainable membership and growth on a long-term basis.
Under the Medicare Advantage system, our members typically enroll with us for a one-year period that can be renewed on an annual basis, resulting in revenue that is principally based on a subscription-like PMPM recurring revenue model. This model provides us with significant visibility into our short-term financial performance, particularly given that the substantial majority of our members continue to choose Alignment after their initial selection year. Further, our HMO and PPO plans covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are generally renewed for a calendar year term, unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the year in which the contract would end. When carefully managed, this annual renewal process provides a measure of stability and predictability to our short-term revenue streams, allowing us to focus on improving health quality outcomes and lowering healthcare expenditures for our population through enhanced member care on a long-term basis.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our proprietary technology platform, AVA, is a key element of our business with capabilities that we expect to impact our future performance. AVA enables us to personalize and manage our member relationships, care quality and experience, and to coordinate and manage risk with our provider partners. AVA’s unified platform, analytical tools and data across the healthcare ecosystem enable us to produce consistent outcomes, unit economics and support new member growth. Additionally, our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future will be, driven by our ability to:
•
Capitalize on Our Existing Market Growth Opportunity: 
Our ability to attract and retain members to grow in our existing markets depends on our ability to offer a superior value proposition. We routinely take market share from large established players in highly competitive markets, a key source of our health plan membership growth in excess of the industry average. We believe that there are still significant opportunities for future growth even in our most mature markets where we have a 10-30% market share. According to CMS data, our approximately 209,900 Health Plan Members represent only 5% market share of Medicare Advantage enrollees in our markets. 
•
Drive Growth and Consistent Outcomes Through New Market Expansion: 
As part of our long-term growth strategy, we may enter new markets with the goal of building brand awareness across our key stakeholders to achieve meaningful market share over time. We intend to focus on markets with significant senior populations where we expect to be able to replicate our model most effectively. Our existing markets also feature a diverse array of membership profiles across ethnicities, income levels and acuity. Since 2020, we have expanded into 29 markets and four states. 
•
Provide Superior Service, Care and Consumer Satisfaction: 
We are highly focused on providing superior service and care to our members and on maintaining high levels of consumer satisfaction, which are key to our financial performance and growth. The CMS Five Star Quality Rating System provides economic incentives to Medicare Advantage plans that achieve higher Star ratings by (i) meeting certain care criteria (such as completing particular preventative screening procedures or ensuring proper follow-up care is provided for specific conditions or episodes) and (ii) receiving high member satisfaction ratings. These incentives impact financial performance in the year following the CMS Rating Year (for example, CMS’s announcement of the 2025 Ratings occurred in the second half of 2024 and will impact our financial performance in 2026). In aggregate, more than 98% of our health plan members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above, meaning the vast majority of members consistently receive a high-quality care experience, as defined under CMS star measurement criteria. Additionally, the California HMO plan has achieved a 4 star or greater rating for seven consecutive years. 
•
Effectively Manage the Quality of Care to Improve Member Outcomes: 
Our care delivery model is based on a clinical continuum through which we have created a highly personalized experience that is unique to each member depending on their personal health and circumstances. Utilizing data and predictive analytics generated by AVA, our clinical continuum separates seniors into four categories in order to provide optimized care for every stage of a senior’s life: healthy, healthy utilizer, pre-chronic and chronic. We partner with our broader network of community providers to service members in our non-chronic categories, and we have developed a Care Anywhere program implemented by our internal clinical teams to care for our higher risk and/or chronically ill members. By investing in our members’ care proactively, our model has consistently reduced unnecessary and costly care while improving the quality of our members’ lifestyle and healthcare experience. By delivering superior care and preventing avoidable utilization of the healthcare system, we are able to reduce our claims expenditures in some of our largest medical expense categories, which translates to superior medical benefits ratio (“MBR”) financial performance and ultimately the ability to offer richer products in the market.
•
Achieve Superior Unit Economics: 
As our senior population ages, their healthcare needs become more frequent and complex. To combat the healthcare cost increases that typically result, we proactively look to (i) connect with our population early in their enrollment with Alignment to assess 
53
Table of Contents
their care needs, (ii) develop care plans and engage those members with more chronic, complex health challenges in our clinical model, and (iii) continue to monitor and evaluate our healthier members in a preventative fashion over time. Given the Medicare Advantage payment mechanism and the retention of the vast majority of our members who continue to choose Alignment after their initial selection year, we are able to focus our efforts on driving favorable long-term health outcomes for our entire population. As a result, our clinical model efforts have demonstrated the ability to lower the MBRs of our returning members. We believe this is evidence of our ability to manage the financial risk of our members as they age, and that these favorable underlying unit economic trends translate directly to our ability to continue to deliver a richer product to the marketplace. With this dynamic in mind, our consolidated MBR may be impacted year-to-year based on our pace of new member growth and mix of members by cohort. However, we believe our ability to sustain MBR performance improvement over time positions us well to invest in new member growth to drive long-term financial performance.
•
Invest in our Platform and Growth:

We plan to continue to invest in our business in order to further develop our AVA platform, pursue new expansion opportunities and create innovative product offerings. In addition, in order to maintain a differentiated value proposition for our members, we continue to invest in innovative product offerings and supplementary benefits to meet the evolving needs of the senior consumer. We anticipate further investments in our business as we expand into new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions, which we expect will primarily be focused on healthcare delivery groups in key geographies, standalone and provider-sponsored Medicare Advantage plans and other complementary risk bearing assets.
•
Navigate Seasonality to our Business:

Our operational and financial results will experience some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. We experience the largest portion of member growth during the first quarter, when plan enrollment selections made during the annual enrollment period ("AEP") from October 15th through December 7th of the prior year take effect. As a result, we expect to see a significant percentage of our member growth occur on January 1 of a given calendar year. As the year progresses, our per-member revenue often declines as new members join us, typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores), and senior mortality disproportionately impacts our higher-acuity (and therefore greater revenue) members. Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We therefore expect to see higher levels of per-member medical costs in the first and fourth quarters. The design of our prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D) results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. We anticipate that, starting in 2025, the benefit redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act will result in much more moderate seasonality than we have experienced in past years. Members will still pass through the benefit phases, but our share of the total liability will be more consistent through each phase than it has been in the past. In addition, we expect our corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth. Due to the timing of many of these investments, including our primary sales and marketing season, we typically incur a greater level of investment in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.
Key Business Metrics
In addition to our financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.

Health Plan Membership
We define Health Plan Membership as the number of members enrolled in our HMO and PPO contracts as of the end of a reporting period. We believe this is an important metric to assess growth of our underlying business, which is indicative of our ability to consistently offer a superior value proposition to seniors. This metric excludes third-party payor members with respect to which we are at-risk for managing their healthcare expenditures, which represented 400 members as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. It also excludes approximately 8,300 and 7,300 ACO REACH members as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Medical Benefits Ratio
Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as loss from operations before depreciation and amortization, clinical equity-based compensation expense, clinical restructuring costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Adjusted gross profit is a key measure used by our management and Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends before the impact of our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses.
Adjusted gross profit should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted gross profit in lieu of loss from operations, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Our use of the term adjusted gross profit may vary from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry and accordingly may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

We calculate our MBR by dividing total medical expenses, excluding depreciation, equity-based compensation and clinical restructuring costs, by total revenues in a given period. We believe our MBR is an indicator of our gross profit for our Medicare Advantage plans and demonstrates the ability of our clinical model to produce superior outcomes by identifying and providing targeted care to our high-risk members resulting in improved member health and reduced total population medical expenses. We expect that this metric may fluctuate over time due to a variety of factors, including our pace of new member growth given that new members typically join Alignment with higher MBRs, while our model has demonstrated an ability to improve MBR for a given cohort over time.
When we determine, on an annual basis, whether we have satisfied the CMS minimum Medical Loss Ratio of 85%, adjustments are made to the MBR calculation to include certain additional expenses related to improving the quality of care provided, and to exclude certain taxes and fees, in each case as permitted or required by CMS and applicable regulatory requirements.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition expenses, certain litigation costs, gains or losses on right of use ("ROU") assets, gains or losses on sale of property and equipment, restructuring costs, equity-based compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and our Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operating plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as we do not consider the excluded items to be part of our ongoing results of operations. Given our intent to continue to invest in our 
55

platform and the scalability of our business in the short to medium-term, we believe Adjusted EBITDA over the long term will be an important indicator of value creation.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA in lieu of net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Results of Operations
We operate and manage our business as a single reporting and operating segment, which is to provide healthcare services to our seniors. The components of our results of operations are as follows:
Revenues
Our revenue is comprised of earned premiums and other revenue. We receive and record premium revenue on a monthly basis from the federal government based on our contract with CMS. In accordance with this arrangement, we assume the responsibility for the outcomes and the economic risk of funding our members’ healthcare, supplemental benefits and related administration costs. We recognize premium revenue in the month that members are entitled to receive healthcare services, and premiums collected in advance are deferred. The monthly premium that we receive under our contract with CMS includes a PMPM which is adjusted based on certain risk factors derived from medical diagnoses for our members. The adjustments are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and are recognized ratably during the year, with adjustments in each period to the amount of revenue recognized to reflect changes in the estimated ultimate premium. Premiums are also recorded net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments.
56
Table of Contents
Our recognized premium revenue for the Alignment Health Plans is subject to a minimum annual medical loss ratio (“MLR”) of 85%. The MLR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue. The Code of Federal Regulations defines what specifically constitutes medical expenses and premium revenue for the MLR test, and if the minimum MLR is not met, we are required to remit a portion of the premiums back to the federal government. The amount remitted, if any, is recognized as an adjustment to premium revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. The amounts payable under this provision were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
The premiums we receive from CMS for our members are based on the annual bid that we submit to CMS. These payments represent revenues for providing healthcare coverage, including Medicare Part D benefits. Under the Medicare Part D program, members receive standard drug benefits. We may also provide enhanced benefits at our own expense. We recognize revenue for providing this insurance coverage in the month that members are entitled to receive healthcare services. Our CMS payment related to Medicare Part D is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. See “—
Critical Accounting Estimates
—
Revenue”
 below
.
Our capitation revenue consists primarily of capitated fees for medical care services provided by us under arrangements with our third-party payors and from CMS related to our ACO REACH entity. In 2024, we entered into a management services and risk management agreement with a third-party healthcare company. The third-party is responsible for arranging and controlling the health care services provided to the ACO members, and for providing certain management and support services with respect to ACO operations. The third-party also assumes specified upside and downside financial risk relative to the ACO’s performance. As a result of this arrangement, revenue is recorded on a net basis within other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Expenses
Medical Expenses. 
Medical expenses include claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses, supplemental benefits, internal care delivery expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care previously provided to our members. Medical expenses also include clinical depreciation and restructuring costs, as discussed above.
We have contracts with a network of hospitals, physicians, and other providers and compensate those providers and ancillary organizations based on contractual arrangements or CMS Medicare compensation guidelines. We pay these contracting providers either through fee-for-service arrangements in which the provider is paid negotiated rates for specific services provided, or through capitation payments, which represent monthly contractual fees disbursed for each member regardless of medical services provided to the member. We are ultimately responsible for the entirety of the cost of healthcare services related to our member population, in addition to supplemental benefits that we provide to our seniors.
Capitation-related expenses are recorded on an accrual basis during the coverage period. Expenses related to fee-for-service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed.
Pharmacy costs represent payments for members’ prescription drug benefits, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. Receivables for such manufacturer rebates are included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) personnel expenses including salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation expense and benefits for non-clinical employees; (ii) all corporate technology, occupancy costs and allocated overhead costs; (iii) professional and outside services, including external vendors and professional services; (iv) costs associated with administering our contracts with CMS, including claims adjudication, member and concierge services, provider engagement, and other health plan functions; and (v) central and community-based advertising costs to generate greater awareness, engagement and retention among our current and prospective members, as well as the infrastructure required to support all of our marketing efforts and ongoing commission payments. These expenses also include restructuring costs, as discussed above, and certain growth expenditures, including business development and various new market expansion activities. Our investments in our sales, marketing and other growth activities are an important component of our selling, general and administrative expenses in a typical year given our desire to continue to grow on an accelerated trajectory. We anticipate continuing to invest heavily in our growth efforts in the near future, which we believe will be an important driver of long-term value creation.
Depreciation and Amortization
. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs.
Other Expense
Interest Expense. 
Interest expense consists primarily of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan (as defined below), as well as interest related to the convertible notes that were issued in November 2024. See “—
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
”
Other (Income) Expenses. 
Other (income) expenses consist primarily of gains or losses on the disposition of assets, as well as gains and losses related to subleased ROU assets.

between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase was offset by a decrease in ACO REACH revenue due to the change from gross to net revenue treatment. ACO REACH revenue decreased $125.2 million, or 101.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Other Revenues. 
Other revenues increased $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the interest rate of our interest earning cash balances. Additionally, the change from gross to net revenue treatment for ACO REACH increased other revenues by $2.3 million.

Medical Expenses.
 Medical expenses were $2,406.9 million and $1,622.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024

and 2023, respectively, an increase of $784.3 million, or 48.3%. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in Alignment Health Plan membership, which increased 58.6% between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Overall, medical expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024  grew at a slightly higher rate than earned premium revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to 2024 having a higher percentage of new members relative to returning members, richer member benefits and increases in unit costs. This increase was offset by lower inpatient admissions per thousand and the change from gross to net revenue treatment for ACO REACH.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $371.4 million and $307.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $63.9 million, or 20.8%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in ongoing investments and expenditures in network development, operations and sales and marketing to drive the growth of Alignment's Health Plan membership. Selling, general, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to economies of scale gained from Alignment's 2024 membership growth.
Depreciation and Amortization. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $26.9 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024

and 2023, respectively, an increase of $5.5 million, or 25.5%. The increase was primarily due to the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and the associated depreciation relative to 2023. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded amortization expense of $0.6 million related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with an inactive Medicare license that was terminated during the period.
Other Expenses
Interest expense.
 Interest expense was $23.5 million and $21.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024

and 2023, respectively, an increase of $2.3 million or 10.8%. The increase in interest expense was partially due to an increase in the debt balance as a result of the $50.0 million drawdown of the Oxford Delayed Draw term loan in June 2024. Additionally, we experienced a higher interest rate on our debt balance during the majority of the year, which then decreased as a result of the issuance of the convertible notes and repayment of the Oxford term loan as discussed below. Prior to the repayment of the Oxford term loans, the average interest rate during 2024 was 11.77% compared to an average interest rate of 11.35% during the year ended December 31, 2023. The convertible notes have an interest rate of 4.25%.
Other (income) expenses, net
. Other (income) expenses were $(0.1) million and $(0.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2024

and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of gains and losses related to ROU assets subleased during the respective periods. 
Loss on extinguishment of debt.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024 we recorded a $3.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the Oxford term loans repayment which is discussed below.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
To date, we have financed our operations principally through our IPO, private placements of our equity securities, revenues, certain term loans and convertible notes (described below). As of December 31, 2024, we had $470.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
We operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Alignment Healthcare, Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, our operating parent company (an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our parent company) had $212.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Table of Contents
We may incur operating losses in the future due to the investments we intend to continue to make in expanding our operations and sales and marketing, in further developing our technology and due to the general and administrative costs we expect to incur in connection with continuing to operate as a public company. As a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business.
We believe that our liquid assets will be sufficient to fund our operating and organic capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary because of, and our future capital requirements will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to expand our presence in existing markets, expand into new markets, increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our technology. Additionally, in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which may also substantially increase our capital needs. 
We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.
Certain states in which we operate as a CMS-licensed Medicare Advantage company may require us to meet certain capital adequacy performance standards and tests. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted rules which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, HMOs, and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. The requirements take the form of risk-based capital (“RBC”) rules, which may vary from state to state. Certain states in which our health plans or risk bearing entities operate have adopted the RBC rules. Other states in which our health plans or risk bearing entities operate have chosen not to adopt the RBC rules, but instead have designed and implemented their own rules regarding capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2024, our health plans or risk-bearing entities were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements.
Oxford Term Loan
On September 2, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we, Alignment Healthcare USA, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company (the “Borrower”) and certain of our other subsidiaries (together with the Company and the Borrower, the “Borrower Parties”) entered into a term loan agreement (the “Oxford Loan Agreement”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), as administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to lend the Borrower an aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million in a series of term loans (the “Term Loans”). Pursuant to the Oxford Loan Agreement, the Borrower received an initial Term Loan of $165.0 million on the Effective Date and had the option to borrow up to an additional $85.0 million of Term Loans (such additional Term Loans, the “Delayed Draw Term Loans”).  On June 14, 2024, we borrowed $50,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans prior to the expiration date for such amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans of June 30, 2024.

Interest on the Term Loans was a variable rate equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a one-month tenor, subject to a floor of 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 6.50%. The interest rate applied during the year ended December 31, 2024 ranged from 11.35% to 11.84%. 
In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes, as noted below, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loans with Oxford Finance on November 22, 2024.
Convertible Senior Notes
On November 22, 2024 (the "Effective Date"), Alignment Healthcare Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $330.0 million of its 4.25%

Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 22, 2024, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 4.25% per annum beginning on May 15, 2025. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The net cash proceeds from the sale of the Notes was approximately $321.1 million, after subtracting fees, discounts and estimated expenses in connection with the transaction.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2029, the Notes will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, upon satisfaction of certain conditions. On or after August 15, 2029, the Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled in shares of Company common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of Company common stock, at the Company’s election.
The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 62.4 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events, including adjustment in the event of certain significant corporate transactions. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $16.04 per share. The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 25% to the closing price of the Company's common stock on November 14, 2024. The Company 
61
Table of Contents
has used the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay in full the $215.0 million aggregate principal amount, accrued interest and fees related to the Oxford term loans, as well as certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, on, all the notes to be due and payable.
The Company has recognized the Notes in their entirety as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument was accounted for separately as an embedded conversion feature within stockholders’ equity.

Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $34.8 million, an increase of $94.0 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in medical expenses payable as a result of the increased Health Plan membership growth during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as a decrease in our net loss over the same period. 
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $39.2 million, an increase of $186.5 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase primarily relates to purchases of short-term treasury securities which were $379.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $82.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 296.9 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in maturities of short-term investments.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $156.0 million, an increase of $155.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is mainly attributable to cash received of $330.0 million in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes discussed above, as well as the $50.0 million draw down of the Oxford Delayed Draw term loan in June 2024. This was offset by the repayment of $215.0 million related to the Oxford term loans, as discussed above.

These obligations include agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and other funding commitments that require fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased with a specific timing established. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
Not included in the table above are our medical expenses payable which are included within current liabilities in our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and three variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in California and North Carolina that meet the consolidation requirements for accounting purposes. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interest is presented within the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets.
Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. Management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. Refer to Note 2 “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policie
s” to our audited consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our critical accounting policies.
Revenue
Payments by CMS to health plans are determined through a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based on the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the member enrolled. These payments are subject to periodic adjustments under CMS’s “risk adjustment model,” which compensates health plans based on the health severity and certain demographic factors of each individual member. Members diagnosed with certain conditions are paid at a higher monthly payment than members who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment model, CMS calculates the risk adjustment payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and healthcare providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. Both premium and capitation revenue (including Medicare Part D) are subject to adjustments under the risk adjustment model.
Throughout the year, we estimate risk adjustment payments based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. The risk adjustment payments are recorded as an adjustment to premium and capitation revenue. Our risk adjustment data is also subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. 
Receivables, including risk adjusted premium due from the government or through third-party payors, pharmacy rebates, and other receivables, are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments.
Medical Expenses Payable
Medical expenses payable includes estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of our members and the members of third-party payors, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, loss adjustment expense reserve for the expected costs of settling these claims, and for liabilities related to physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes.
63
Table of Contents
We develop estimates for medical expenses incurred but not yet paid (“IBNP”) which includes an estimate for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and a payable for adjudicated claims. IBNR is estimated using an actuarial process that is consistently applied and centrally controlled. Medical expenses payable also includes an estimate for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate IBNR liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors, such as cost trends and completion factors that are assessed based on historical data for payment patterns, product mix, seasonality, utilization of health care services, and other relevant factors. 
Completion Factors.
 A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical expenses payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical expenses payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2024:

Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors
. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical expenses payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends and inpatient hospital authorization data. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical expenses payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024:

Each period, we re-examine previously established IBNR estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the IBNR estimates recorded in prior periods develop, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified.
Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the IBNP estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate.
64
Table of Contents
In many situations, the claims amount ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNP an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions, which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in its actuarial method of reserving.
We believe that medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required. However, such estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events. Therefore, the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts provided. The following tables provide information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2024:

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. 
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, we had $71.1 million of U.S. Treasury bills which were classified as held to maturity and had maturities less than twelve months. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk on these investments is not significant. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes.
In November 2024, we completed the sale of $330.0 million of 4.25%

Convertible Senior Notes. Since the notes have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial or economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate debt fluctuates when interest rates change. Additionally, the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes can be impacted when the market price of our common stock fluctuates. 
Inflation Risk
Based on our analysis of the periods presented, although we have experienced modest increases in unit costs and labor expenses, we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to 
65
Table of Contents
significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alignment Healthcare, Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes listed in the accompanying Index (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Medical expenses payable – Incurred but not paid claims - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Medical expenses payable includes estimates of obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of members and the members of contracted third-party payors, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not yet paid (IBNP) claim liabilities, which totaled $168.4 million as of December 31, 2024, and includes an estimate for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The Company develops estimates for IBNR claim liability by using actuarial methods that requires management judgment in developing its estimates. These actuarial methods consider factors such as 1) historical data for payment patterns, 2) assumptions of cost trends related to the medical cost per member per month, and 3) completion factors to account for the time from date of service to claim receipt. 
We identified the estimation of IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the estimate of the IBNR claim liability.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the IBNR claim liability included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s actuarial process for estimating the IBNR claim liability.

Table of Contents
•
We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to determine the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.
•
With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by:
▪
Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s actuarial model to the data used in prior periods to determine whether there were material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods.
▪
Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of the IBNR IBNP claim liability to claims processed in 2024 with dates of service in 2023 and prior.
▪
Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and compared our estimate to management’s estimate. Our independent estimate included development of per member per month claims cost trends and completion factors using management’s data, and comparison of these assumptions to current and historical claims trends and current industry benchmarks.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(amounts in thousands, except share amounts)
1. 
Organization
Alignment Healthcare, Inc. (collectively, “we” or “us” or “our” or the “Company”), is a next generation, consumer-centric health care platform that is purpose-built to provide seniors with high quality, affordable care with a vastly improved consumer experience. Enabled by our innovative technology and care delivery model, the Company focuses on improving outcomes in the Medicare Advantage sector. The Company’s operations primarily consist of Medicare Advantage Plans in the states of California, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Florida and Texas.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, our subsidiaries, and 
three
 immaterial variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interest is presented within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.
We have no components of other comprehensive income (loss), and accordingly, comprehensive income (loss) is the same as the net income (loss) for all periods presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Our significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of medical expenses payable; the impact of risk adjustment provisions related to our Medicare contracts; collectability of receivables; valuation of related impairment recognition of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets; equity-based compensation expense; and contingent liabilities. Estimates and judgments are based upon historical information and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and the impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Segments
We have determined that our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) who regularly reviews financial operating results on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We operate and manage the business as 
one
 reportable segment and 
one
 operating segment, which is to provide healthcare services to our seniors. Factors used in determining the reportable segment include the nature of operating activities, our organizational and reporting structure, and the type of information reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources and evaluate financial performance. All of our assets are located in the United States.
The CODM assesses the Company's performance by using consolidated net loss which is reported on the consolidated statements of operations as net loss. This measure is used predominantly by the CODM in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources for the Company.

In addition to net loss, the CODM is also provided information on certain significant segment expenses which are presented below:

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were based upon a three-tier hierarchy as follows:
Level 1
 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2
 - Other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability
Level 3
 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date
The fair value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and U.S. Treasury bills was determined based on Level 1 inputs. The fair value of the convertible senior note and certificate of deposits, which are recorded in long-term debt and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, respectively, were determined based on Level 2 inputs. There were 
no
 assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our long-term debt was reported at carrying value.
Revenue and Accounts Receivable
Earned premium revenue consisting of premium revenue and capitation revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows:

Premium revenue is derived monthly from the federal government based on our contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). In accordance with these arrangements, we assume the responsibility for the outcomes and the economic risk of funding our members’ health care, supplemental benefits and related administration costs. We recognize premium revenue in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services, and premiums collected in advance are deferred. The monthly reimbursement includes a fixed payment per member per month (“PMPM”), which is adjusted based on certain risk factors derived from medical diagnoses and conditions of our members. The adjustments are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and are recognized ratably during the year, with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the estimated ultimate premium. Premiums are also recorded net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments.
Capitation revenue consists primarily of capitated fees for medical care services provided by us under arrangements with third-party payors.
Under those arrangements with third-party payors, we receive a PMPM payment for a defined member population, and we are responsible for providing health care services to the member population over the contract period. We are solely responsible for the cost of health care services related to the member population and in some cases, we are financially responsible for the supplemental benefits provided by us to the members. We act as a principal in arranging for and controlling the services provided by our provider network and we are at risk for arranging and providing health care services.
The premium and capitation payments we receive monthly from CMS for our members are determined from our annual bid or similarly from third-party payors under our capitation arrangement. These payments represent revenues for providing health care coverage, including Medicare Part D benefits. Under the Medicare Part D program, our members and the members of the third-party payors receive standard drug benefits. We may also provide enhanced benefits at our own expense. We recognize premium or capitation revenue for providing this insurance coverage in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services and any premium or capitation collected in advance is deferred. Our CMS payment related to Medicare Part D is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions.
 In 2023, capitation revenue consisted primarily of revenue from CMS related to our participation in the CMS “ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health Model” or “ACO REACH” model, formerly the Direct Contracting Model ("DCE"). CMS serves as the claim adjudicator for institutional and specialists care, and directly pays for such fee for service claims. The ACO REACH entity 
75
Table of Contents
("ACO") is responsible for the cost of health care services related to the patient population attributed to the ACO by participating in 100% savings/losses via the risk share model and in some cases, are financially responsible for the supplemental benefits provided to the patients. In 2024, we entered into a management services and risk management agreement with a third-party healthcare company. The third-party is responsible for arranging and controlling the health care services provided to the ACO members, and for providing certain management and support services with respect to ACO operations. The third-party also assumes specified upside and downside financial risks relative to the ACO’s performance. As a result of this arrangement, revenue is recorded on a net basis within other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Revenue recognized by the ACO for the years ended December 31, 2024 was $
984
.
Prior to 2024, the ACO acted as a principal in arranging for and controlling services provided directly by their contracts with primary care physicians, as well as services provided by preferred institutional care providers and specialists. Capitation payments for the ACO program are determined from an annual benchmark established by CMS. These payments, which are adjusted for variable considerations, represented revenue for providing health care services, including primary care as well as institutional and specialist care. The ACO recognized capitation revenue for providing these services in the period in which the performance obligations were satisfied by transferring services to the members. Revenue recognized by the ACO for the years ended, 2023 and 2022 was $
123,972
 and $
50,946
, respectively.
Interest income earned on our cash deposits and short-term investments is included within other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
23,986
, $

Revenue Adjustments
Payments by CMS to health plans are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based upon the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the member enrolled. These payments are subject to periodic adjustments under CMS’ “risk adjustment model,” which compensates health plans based on the health severity and certain demographic factors of each individual member. Members diagnosed with certain conditions are paid at a higher monthly payment than members who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment model, CMS calculates the risk adjustment payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. Both premium and capitation revenues (including Medicare Part D) are subject to adjustments under the risk adjustment model.
Throughout the year, we estimate risk adjustment payments based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Those estimated risk adjustment payments are recorded as an adjustment to premium and capitation revenue. Our risk adjustment data is also subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators.
Our recognized premium revenue for our Medicare Advantage Plans in California, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Texas and Florida are each subject to a minimum annual medical loss ratio (“MLR”) of 
85
%. The MLR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue. The Code of Federal Regulations defines what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue, including certain additional expenses related to improving the quality of care provided, and the exclusion of certain taxes and fees, in each case as permitted or required by CMS and applicable regulatory requirements. If the minimum MLR is not met, we are required to remit a portion of the premiums back to the federal government. The amount remitted, if any, is recognized as an adjustment to premium revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The amounts payable under this provision were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Medicare Part D payments are also subject to a federal risk corridor program, which limits a health plan’s overall losses or profit if actual spending for basic Medicare Part D benefits is much higher or lower than what was anticipated. Risk corridor is recorded within premium revenue. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids or third-party payors’ bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS or third-party payors making additional payments to us or require us to refund a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenue related to these provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in our consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of expected settlement.
Variable consideration estimates related to ACO contract revenue are based on the most likely outcome method and that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur.
Receivables, including risk adjusted premium due from the government or through third-party payors, pharmacy rebates, and other receivables, are shown net of allowances for credit losses and retroactive membership adjustments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes currency on hand with banks and financial institutions. We consider short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the investments.
76
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash equivalents were $
32,494
 and $
22,232
, respectively.
Investments
Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale at the time of purchase. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term.
Restricted and Other Long-Term Assets
Restricted assets are composed of restricted cash and investments in US Treasury bills and certificate of deposits. The Company intends to hold its investments until maturity; therefore, these investments are stated at amortized cost. Premiums and discounts, if any, are amortized or accreted as interest expense or income over the life of the related asset using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all investments had maturities with less than 12 months.
Restricted assets are required to be maintained at a financial institution within certain states. Due to the nature of the state’s requirements, these assets are classified as noncurrent assets regardless of the contractual maturity date.
Property and Equipment—Net
Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed when incurred. Costs and the related accumulated depreciation are removed when property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
Software development activities typically consist of three phases: (1) planning, (2) application and infrastructure development, and (3) post implementation. Costs incurred in the planning and post implementation phases, including post-configuration training and repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in the application and infrastructure development phases, including significant enhancements and upgrades, are capitalized once the planning phase is completed and management authorizes the project to commence. Those costs include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefit expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development projects and outside contractor expenses. Software development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method generally based on the following estimated useful lives:

Estimated Service Lives (years)
Computer and equipment
5
Office equipment and furniture

Software

Leasehold improvements

 (or lease term, if shorter)
Depreciation expense related to property and equipment used to service our members or at our clinics are included within medical expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and evaluate each lease arrangement to determine whether the lease is an operating or financing lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets include upfront payments, if any, and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
We utilize our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments if an interest rate is not implicit in the lease. Expenses for our operating and finance leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses for operating leases and as depreciation expense and interest expense for finance leases.
We elected practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed the carryforward of historical lease classification, assessment on whether a contract was or contains a lease and allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2020 and did not restate previously reported results in the comparative periods. We also elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Leases with an initial term of 12 months are not included within the ROU assets and lease liabilities and the associated lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are included in ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and long-term portion of lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) goodwill, (2) indefinite-lived intangible assets, and (3) definite-lived intangible assets.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. For definite-lived intangible assets, we determine the useful lives of intangible assets after considering each asset’s specific facts and circumstances. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Impairment
Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Impairment tests are performed, at a minimum, in the fourth quarter of each year supported by our long-range business plan and annual planning process.
When testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative assessment.
If the quantitative test is needed, we determine an appropriate valuation technique to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the testing date. We utilize the income approach and the market approach to assess the most appropriate fair value for the reporting unit. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting assumptions used in our analyses could result in goodwill impairment in future periods.
When testing indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired, an impairment is evaluated by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
We review these assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to the carry value. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment determination is required. The amount of impairment is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value. An impairment charge, if any, is recognized within earnings from operations.
Medical Expenses
Medical expenses include claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses, internal care delivery expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage and care to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care and other supplemental benefits provided.
We have contracts with a network of hospitals, physicians, and other providers and compensate those providers and ancillary organizations based on contractual arrangements or CMS Medicare compensation guidelines. We pay these contracting providers either through fee-for-service arrangement in which the provider is paid negotiated rates for specific services provided or a capitation payment, which represent monthly contractual fees disbursed for each member regardless of medical services provided to the member. We are responsible for the entirety of the cost of health care services related to the member population, in addition to supplemental benefits provided by us to our seniors. In 2023, we also recorded claims expenses related to our institutional and specialist care related to our ACO program with CMS as we acted as the principal in the transaction. As discussed above, beginning in 2024, claims expense related to the ACO program is netted against ACO revenue as we act as the agent in these transactions.
Capitation-related expenses are recorded on an accrual basis during the coverage period. Expenses related to fee-for-service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed.
Pharmacy costs represent payments for members’ prescription drug benefits, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. Receivables for such pharmacy rebates are included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was signed into law. The law intends to increase tax revenue and reduce Medicare costs through lower prescription drug prices, inflation rebates, and increased financial responsibility for certain drug manufacturers. The provisions of the law are set to take effect over the next seven years. There was an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2024 and the 2025 bid pricing and budget reflect the expected impact the IRA will have on our business for fiscal year 2025.

Medical Expenses Payable
Medical expenses payable includes estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of our members and the members of the third-party payors, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, loss adjustment expense reserve for the expected costs of settling these claims, and for liabilities related to physician, hospital, and other medical cost disputes.
We develop estimates for medical expenses incurred but not yet paid (“IBNP”), which includes an estimate for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and a payable for adjudicated claims. IBNR is estimated using an actuarial process that is consistently applied and centrally controlled. Medical expenses payable also includes an estimate for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate the IBNR liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors, such as cost trends and completion factors that are assessed based on historical data for payment patterns, product mix, seasonality, utilization of health care services, and other relevant factors. Each period, we re-examine previously established IBNR estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the IBNR estimates recorded in prior periods develop, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified.
Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the IBNP estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. In many situations, the claims amount ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNP an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions, which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving. We believe that medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required. However, such estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events. Therefore, the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts provided.
We reassess the profitability of contracts for providing coverage to members when current operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses. A premium deficiency reserve is established in current operations to the extent that the sum of expected future costs, claim adjustment expenses, and maintenance costs exceed related future premiums under contract and investment income. For purposes of determining premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Losses recognized as a premium deficiency result in a beneficial effect in subsequent periods as operating losses under these contracts are charged to the liability previously established.
Part D Subsidies
We also receive advance payments each month from CMS related to Catastrophic Reinsurance, Coverage Gap Discount, and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (“Subsidies”). Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for our portion of prescription drug costs, which exceed the member’s out-of-pocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Law mandates consumer discounts of 75% on brand-name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. The majority of the discounts are funded by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, while we fund a smaller portion and administer the application of the total discount. In 2025, the IRA retires the Coverage Gap Discount Program and introduces the Manufacturer Discount Program. While CMS’s share of the drug cost liability is expected to decline from Catastrophic Reinsurance and Low-Income Member Cost Sharing, prescription drug manufacturers are expected to experience increased liability. These program changes and the corresponding changes in prepayments were embedded in the 2025 bid pricing.
These Subsidies represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program and are recorded as deposits or payables. These Subsidies received in excess of, or less than, actual subsidized benefits paid are refundable to or recoverable from CMS through an annual reconciliation process following the end of the contract year. 
The amounts refundable to or recoverable from CMS, including risk corridor as discussed above, were recorded in the following accounts within the consolidated balance sheets:

Shared Risk Reserve Arrangements
We established a fund (also referred to as “a pool”) for risk and profit-sharing with various independent physician associations (“IPAs”). The pool enables us and our IPAs to share in the financial responsibility and/or upside associated with providing covered medical expenses to our members. The risk pool is based on a contractually agreed upon medical budget, typically based upon a percentage of revenue. If actual medical expenses are less than the budgeted amount, this results in a surplus. Conversely, if actual medical expenses are greater than the budgeted amount, this results in a deficit. We will distribute the surplus, or a portion thereof, to each IPA based upon contractual terms. Deficits are charged to shared risk providers’ risk pool as per the contractual term and evaluated for collectability at each reporting period.
We record risk-sharing receivables and payables on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheet. Throughout the year, we evaluate expected losses on risk-sharing receivables and record the resulting expected losses to the reserve. We systematically build and release reserves based on adequacy and its assessment of expected losses on a monthly basis. Credit loss associated with risk share deficit receivables are recorded within medical expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded an allowance for credit losses for substantially all of the risk-sharing receivable balance due to collection risk related to the balance. The risk-sharing payable is included within medical expenses payable on the consolidated balance sheet.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash deposits and current and restricted investments with financial institutions. Accounts at each financial institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to certain limits. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $
469,373
 and $
316,977
, respectively, in excess of FDIC-insured limits.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect at the time such temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefits achieved through the reductions in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based on all available positive and negative evidence.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately reflect actual outcomes. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits are recognized as a component of interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, in the consolidated statement of operations.
Member Acquisition Costs
Member acquisition costs primarily relate to internal and external broker commission costs. These member acquisition costs related to our health services contract with our members are expensed as incurred and are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. These short-term health services contract typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the member.
Advertising Expenses
The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses were $
5,756
, $
6,956
, and $
7,958
, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and were reported as selling, general and administrative expenses.
Equity-Based Compensation
Equity-based compensation expense is measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) is estimated based on the fair value of our underlying common stock on the date of grant. 
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the award’s expected term, the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected volatility of the price of the common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock-based awards are management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. The expected term represents the period the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we utilize the simplified method available under U.S. GAAP. As we do not have a substantial trading history, 
80
Table of Contents
volatility assumptions were developed using a combination of the Company's historical volatility and the historical volatilities of a set of peer companies, adjusted for debt-equity leverage. Equity-based compensation expense for awards with service-based vesting only is recognized on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally 
four years
. 
Equity-based compensation expense for RSU awards with performance-based vesting is recognized over the requisite service period on a graded vesting schedule and is only recognized when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition(s) will be achieved. At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment, and the estimate of share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
Equity-based compensation is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses, and medical expenses based on the function of the applicable employee and non-employee.
Net Loss per Share

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07 around segment disclosures. The new standard requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide, in interim periods, all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The guidance was for annual periods beginning with the Company's fiscal year 2024, and in interim periods within the Company's fiscal year 
81

2025. The Company adopted the requirements of this ASU within our segment disclosure in Note 2 Summary of  Significant Accounting Policies above. The adoption only impacted our disclosures with no impact to our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Issued
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04 “
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
”, which improves and clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for an as induced conversion. ASU 2024-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025 (and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.
Additionally, in November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 “
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
”, which improve income statement presentation and disclosures related to expenses. It requires a public entity to disaggregate key expense categories such as employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization within its financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning with the Company's fiscal year 2027, and interim periods within the Company's fiscal year 2028, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its disclosures of income statement expenses. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 
"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
",  which requires public entity to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all period presented. We expect this ASU to only impact our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

The carrying value of long-term debt represents the outstanding balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our long-term debt approximates the carrying value.
Our nonfinancial assets and liabilities, which include goodwill, intangible assets, property, and equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, on a periodic basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, we assess these assets for impairment. We recorded an impairment charge related to intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
No

The allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivable is based primarily on past collections experience relative to the length of time receivables are past due. However, when available evidence reasonably supports an assumption that future economic conditions will differ from current and historical payment collections, an adjustment is reflected in the allowance for expected credit losses. We record pharmacy rebates and other receivables based on contractual terms and expected collections and our estimation process for contractual allowances for such balances generally results in an allowance for balances outstanding greater than 90 days or if expected credit risks are known.
Receivables and any associated allowance are written off only when all collection attempts have failed and such amounts are determined unrecoverable. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances based on a variety of factors, including age of the outstanding receivable and collection history. When circumstances related to specific collection patterns change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted. Because substantially all of our receivable amounts are readily determinable and a large portion of our creditors are governmental authorities, our allowance for credit losses is insignificant.
We recorded credit losses related to accounts receivable of $
123
, $
91
, and $
150
 during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The amounts were recorded in selling general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Each period, we re-examine previously established outstanding claims reserve estimates based on actual claims submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in claim costs in the period in which the change is identified. Substantially, all of the total claims paid by us are known and settled within the first year from the date of service, and substantially, all remaining claim amounts are paid within a 
three-year

Oxford Term Loan
On September 2, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we, Alignment Healthcare USA, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company (the “Borrower”) and certain of our other subsidiaries entered into a term loan agreement (the “Oxford Loan Agreement”) with Oxford Finance LLC, as administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to lend the Borrower an aggregate principal amount of up to $
250,000
 in a series of term loans (the “Term Loans”). Pursuant to the Oxford Loan Agreement, the Borrower received an initial Term Loan of $
165,000
 on the Effective Date and had the option to borrow up to an additional $
85,000
 of Term Loans.  On June 14, 2024, we borrowed $
50,000
 in aggregate principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans prior to the expiration date for such amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans of June 30, 2024. Interest on the Term Loans was a variable rate equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a one-month tenor, subject to a floor of 
1.00
%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 
6.50
%. The interest rate applied during the year ended December 31, 2024 ranged from 
11.35
% to 
11.84
%. 
In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes, as noted below, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the terms loans with Oxford Finance on November 22, 2024.
Convertible Senior Notes
On November 22, 2024, the Company completed the sale of $
330,000
 of our 
4.25
% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 22, 2024, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 
4.25
% per annum beginning on May 15, 2025. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The net cash proceeds from the sale of the Notes was approximately $
321,100
, after subtracting fees, discounts and estimated expenses in connection with the transaction.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2029, the Notes will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, upon satisfaction of certain conditions. On or after August 15, 2029, the Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the 
86
Table of Contents
Notes may be settled in shares of Company common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of Company common stock, at the Company’s election.
The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 62.4 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events, including adjustment in the event of certain significant corporate transactions. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
16.04
 per share. The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 
25
% to the closing price of the Company's common stock on November 14, 2024. The Company has used the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay in full the $
215,000
 aggregate principal amount, accrued interest and fees related to the Oxford term loans, as well as certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 
25
% in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 
100
% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, on, all the notes to be due and payable.
The Company has recognized the Notes in their entirety as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument was accounted for separately as an embedded conversion feature within stockholders’ equity.
Future maturities under the term loan as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:

Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, federal NOL carryforwards were $
565,838
 and $
504,097
, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, state NOL carryforwards were $
543,513
 and $
498,933
, respectively, and $
374,188
 of the total federal net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite life while the remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2033 if not utilized.
Of the total NOL carryforwards, approximately $
19,031
 of federal and $
13,221
 of California NOL carryforwards relate to Alignment Health Plan, Inc. for which the utilization of the federal NOL carryforward is subject to a federal Section 382 limitation of $
870
 per year, and the utilization of the California NOL carryforwards is subject to a similar California annual limitation. In June 2020, California’s Governor signed into law Assembly Bill (“AB”) 85 suspending California NOL utilization for taxpayers with more than $1 million of taxable income, effective for tax years 2021, 2022, and 2023. AB 85 includes an extended carryover period for the suspended NOLs with an additional year carryforward for each year of suspension. Subsequently, on February 9, 2022, the California governor signed Senate Bill 113 (S.B. 113), which restores the NOL deduction and eliminates the $5 million annual cap on business incentive tax credits, effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. In June 2024, California’s Governor signed into law AB 167 suspending California NOL utilization for taxpayers with more than $1 million of taxable income, effective for tax years 2024, 2025, and 2026. AB 167 includes an extended carryover period for suspended NOLs that would have been utilized if not for AB 167.
We have cumulative NOLs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Given the history of losses, and after consideration for the risk associated with estimates of future taxable income, we established a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), federal NOLs generated after 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely but are limited to an 80% deduction of taxable income. NOLs generated prior to 2018 have a 20-year carryforward period and can be used to offset 100% of taxable income. An exception to the TCJA federal NOL rule applies to certain of our subsidiaries and requires all NOLs generated from those entities to have a 20-year carryforward period and offset 100% of taxable income.
Additionally, an “ownership change” as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could potentially limit the ability to utilize certain tax attributes including the Company’s substantial NOLs. Ownership change is generally defined as any significant change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year testing period. If, as a result of current or future transactions involving our common stock, we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50% over the testing period, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under IRC Section 382. We continue to monitor changes in ownership with respect to these income tax provisions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.

Equity-Based Compensation
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
On March 25, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). Under the 2021 Plan, employees, consultants and directors of our Company and our affiliates that perform services for us are eligible to receive awards. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), non-statutory stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, performance awards, other share based awards (including restricted stock units) and other cash-based awards. ISOs may be granted only to employees, including officers. All other awards may be granted to employees, including officers, non-employee directors and consultants. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan may not exceed 
20,744,444
 shares (subject to a discretionary annual increase of up to 
4
% effective as of January 1 of each year for 
10
 years). 
Equity Awards
Stock options
Our outstanding stock options generally vest 
25
% annually over 
four years
 and generally expire 
10
 years from the date of the grant. The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan provides that stock option grants will be made with an exercise price at no less than the estimated fair value of common stock at the date of the grant.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs")
On September 14, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the grant of performance-based restricted stock units under the Company's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan to its executive management team and other key employees. Each grantee is eligible to vest in a number of PSUs ranging from 
0
% to 
150
% of the target number of PSUs granted, based on the aggregated achievement by the Company of certain performance metrics during the performance period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024. The achievement of PSUs relative to the approved target is based on the following performance metrics and relative weighting: Health Plan Revenue Growth Percentage (
60
%), At-Risk Returning Member Medical Benefit Ratio (
20
%) and Adjusted EBITDA, less Capital Expenditures (

Regulatory Requirements and Restricted Funds
Our health plans or risk-bearing entities are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which it operates.
Risk-Based Capital Regulatory
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted rules, which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, HMOs, and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage. The requirements take the form of risk-based capital (“RBC”) rules, which may vary from state to state. Certain states in which our health plans or risk bearing entities operate in have adopted the RBC rules. Our health plans or risk-bearing entities were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements for all periods presented.
Tangible Net Equity
Our health plan in California is required to comply with the tangible net equity (“TNE”) requirements. The required amount is the larger of: (1) $1,000; (2) 2% of the first $150,000 of annualized premium revenue, plus 1% of annualized premium revenue in excess of $150,000; or (3) 8% of the first $150,000 of annualized health care expenditures, except for those paid on a capitated or managed hospital payment basis, plus 4% of the annualized health care expenditures in excess of $150,000, except those paid on a capitated or managed hospital payment basis, plus 4% of annualized hospital expenditures paid on a managed hospital payment basis. We were in compliance with the TNE requirement for all periods presented.
We have the ability to provide additional capital to each of our health plans or risk-bearing entities when necessary to ensure that the RBC and TNE requirements are met.
Certain states regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers from our regulated subsidiaries to our non-regulated subsidiaries and parent company. Such payments may require approval by state regulatory authorities and are limited based on certain 
91
Table of Contents
financial criteria, such as the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus, or the entity’s level of tangible net equity or net worth, among other measures. These regulations vary by state. Our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory capital of approximately $
156,167
 and $
111,967
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements of $
75,212
 and $
48,326
, respectively. The amount of undistributed dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that may be paid out to our parent without regulatory approval was $
46,785
 and $
24,349
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We were in compliance with the RBC and TNE requirements as of December 31, 2024. 
Restricted Assets
Pursuant to the regulations governing our subsidiaries, we maintain certain deposits required by the government authorities in the form of cash, certificates of deposit and Treasury bills as protection in the event of insolvency. The use of funds from these investments is limited as required by regulation in the various states in which we operate, or as needed in the event of insolvency. Therefore, these deposits are reported within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
We hold these assets until maturity, at which time these assets will renew or are invested in a similar type of investment instrument. Given the regulatory requirements, we expect to hold these investments for long-term. As a result, we do not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates. These investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. See note 3, Fair Value, for further discussion.
12. 
Leases
Our leases are primarily for our corporate office, including parking spaces, and healthcare services operating facilities and expire at various intervals up through 2030. The majority of our leases contain renewal options, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 
five years
 per option. 
The majority of our leases are comprised of fixed payments. When certain portions of the lease payments are not fixed, we consider those payments to be variable in nature. These variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, common area maintenance, parking, taxes and insurance. These variable payments are not included in the ROU asset or lease liability and are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and are recorded based upon actual costs in the period incurred.
Certain leases also contain rent escalation clauses that require additional rental amounts in the later years of the term. Rent expense for leases with rent escalation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
At December 31, 2024, $
7,818
 of operating ROU assets were recorded as right of use assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease liabilities of $
1,212
 and $
7,835
 were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. At December 31, 2023, $
9,959
 of operating ROU assets were recorded as right of use assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease liabilities of $
1,717
 and $
8,974
 were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. 
The following table summarizes total fixed operating lease costs and variable operating lease cost, excluding short-term lease and finance lease costs, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

1,525
, $
3,510
 and $
4,214
, respectively.
Lease liabilities are based on the net present value of the remaining lease payments over the remaining lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date.
The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is 
4.4
 years with a weighted average discount rate 
12.0
% at December 31, 2024. 
In the year ended December 31, 2024, $

Employee Benefit Plans
All full-time employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan that we sponsor upon completing 90 days of services. Eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by law. We match 
100
% of contributions not exceeding 
4
% of the employee's compensation. We made matching contributions of $
3,798
, $
3,471
, and $
2,599
 during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and were included within medical expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
14. 
Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
We record a liability and accrue the costs for a loss when an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In some cases, no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal and regulatory proceedings. While the liability and accrued costs reflect our best estimate, the actual amounts may materially be different.
On April 27, 2022, a former employee of the Company filed a purported class action lawsuit (Dabney v. Alignment Healthcare USA, LLC, Orange County Superior Court) alleging that the Company failed to provide hourly employees with required meal and rest breaks or pay such workers a premium equal to an hour of pay for missed meal or rest breaks. Discovery in the matter commenced on June 8, 2022. On September 2, 2022, the court granted a stay of proceedings and discovery in anticipation of mediation scheduled for August 2023. On August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a tentative settlement of the action in consideration of an aggregate payment of 
93
Table of Contents
$
913
. The settlement of this matter is subject to approval by the court which is expected in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the tentative settlement, the Company has accrued for a potential liability of $
913
 as of December 31, 2024 for this matter, which was recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet and selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.
On July 7, 2023, a stockholder of Alignment ﬁled a purported class action lawsuit (Maglione v. Alignment Healthcare, Inc., et al, Delaware Chancery Court). The plaintiff alleged that certain provisions of Alignment’s stockholder agreement with General Atlantic (“GA”) and Warburg Pincus violate Delaware law. On April 30, 2024, the Company agreed to amend the stockholder agreement to eliminate the provisions challenged by the Maglione plaintiff.  On May 24, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order voluntarily dismissing the action as moot, which the court granted. Pursuant to the order, the court retained jurisdiction regarding attorneys’ fees.
The Company has entered into discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel to negotiate with respect to attorney’s fees. Plaintiff’s counsel made a settlement demand and the Company presented a counteroffer that was rejected by plaintiff’s counsel. Negotiations remain ongoing. The Company expects losses related to this case to be immaterial.

We may be involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Amounts accrued for legal proceedings were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Purchase Obligations
We have agreements for goods and services which include fixed, minimum and estimated payments under existing contractual obligations that are legally enforceable and binding. These obligations include agreements that are cancellable with the payment of an early termination penalty and other funding commitments that require fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased with a specific timing established. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty.
Professional Liability Insurance
We maintain coverage for professional liability, errors and omissions, directors and officers, employment practices liability insurance, and worker’s compensation. The professional liability insurance policy is claims based while the other insurance policies are occurrence based. Such policies provide coverage for our employees, certain covered physicians, loss of income due to potential business interruption, and possible destruction or theft of assets. There have not been any reductions in coverage nor have there been any claims, which have exceeded such coverage(s) for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Medical Reinsurance (Stop-Loss insurance)
We utilize medical insurance (or stop-loss agreements) to limit excess losses on individual members. Under the terms of the stop-loss agreements, we are reimbursed for certain proportions of the cost of each member’s hospital expenses in excess of a specified deductible in a coverage period, limited to $
2,000
 in aggregate per member per coverage period. In 2024, all of our markets were covered by stop-loss agreements which included dates of service prior to October 1, 2024, and we have until April 30, 2025, to submit claims to the reinsurance carrier for reimbursement. 
We began a new policy on October 1, 2024, which will cover dates of service through September 30, 2025, and will allow us to submit claims for reimbursement through November 31, 2026. The new policy includes both professional and hospital expenses in the calculation against the specified deductibles and removes the recovery limit of $
2,000
 in aggregate per member per policy period.
Reinsurance premiums are included in medical costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
In the event that the third-party with whom we have contracted is unable to meet its obligations under the stop-loss agreement, we remain 
100
% liable for paying such claim amounts submitted. 
Related Parties
Joseph Konowiecki currently serves as Chairman of the Board and previously served in an executive role with the Company. Mr. Konowiecki’s son is a partner in the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP (“MWE”), which provided legal services to the Company and our subsidiaries during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and continues to do so. For providing these services, MWE received fees related to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of approximately $
272
, $
518
 and $
1,326
, respectively. Mr. Konowiecki’s son does not receive any direct compensation from the fees paid to MWE by us, and the fees paid by us to MWE in fiscal 2024 were considered immaterial to the service provider.

Condensed Financial Information (Parent Company Only)
Certain subsidiaries are subject to state regulatory restrictions which set minimum capitalization requirements and require us to maintain certain deposits in the form of cash, certificates of deposit and Treasury bills as protection in the event of insolvency. Refer to Note 11 Regulatory Requirements and Restricted Funds for more information. Since the restricted net assets of our subsidiaries exceed 25% of

Basis of Presentation
Alignment Healthcare, Inc's. (the "Parent") parent company financial information has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and have been presented on a "parent-only" basis. Under a parent-only presentation, the investment in subsidiaries is presented under the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies for the parent company are the same as those described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Parent is a holding company with no material operations of its own that conducts substantially all of its activities through its subsidiaries. The Parent has no cash and, as a result, expenses and obligations of the Parent are allocated to and paid by its subsidiaries. The accompanying condensed financial information of the Parent should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Investment in Subsidiary
For purposes of these condensed financial statements, our wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded using the equity method of accounting. Investment in subsidiary represents capital contributions to subsidiaries and return of capital from our subsidiaries to us.
The Parent and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns filed by the Parent. Income taxes are allocated to each subsidiary in an amount equivalent to the amount which would be recognized by the subsidiary if it filed a separate tax return.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024. 
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.
Changes to our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting:
There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The majority of our work force works in a hybrid-remote fashion. We have not identified any impact in our internal control over financial reporting as a result of this working environment, in part because our internal control over financial reporting was designed to operate in a remote working environment. We are continually monitoring and assessing our remote working arrangements to determine any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alignment Healthcare, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of 
98
Table of Contents
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
