FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Throughout this annual report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”), we make “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are generally located in the material set forth under the heading 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
 but may be found in other locations as well. These statements are based upon management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are not guarantees of timing, future results or performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including:
•
our history of net losses, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in an environment of increasing expenses;
•
the effect of our relatively limited operating history on investors’ ability to evaluate our current business and future prospects;
•
the viability of our growth strategy and our ability to realize expected results;
•
our ability to attract new members and to successfully enter into new markets;
•
the quality and pricing of our products and services;
•
our ability to maintain a high rating for our plans on the Five Star Quality Rating System;
•
our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with care providers that service our members;
•
our ability to manage our growth effectively, execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and member satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges;
•
our ability to compete in the healthcare industry;
•
the impact on our business of security breaches, loss of data or other disruptions causing the compromise of sensitive information or preventing us from accessing critical information;
•
the impact on our business of disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or management continuity planning;
•
the cost of legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property and privacy disputes;
•
our dependence on reimbursements by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and premium payments by individuals;
•
other risks associated with being a government contractor;
•
the impact on our business of the healthcare services industry becoming more cyclical;
•
our ability to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully;
•
our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our reputation and brand recognition;
•
our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems;
•
our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology;
•
the potential adverse impact of claims by third parties that we are infringing on, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights;
•
the impact of any restrictions on our use of or ability to license data or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies;
•
our dependence on our senior management team and other key employees;
•
the concentration of our health plans in a limited number of U.S. states;
•
our management team’s limited experience managing a public company;
•
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and the potential impact of certain affirmative and negative covenants in our term loan agreement on our business;
•
the impact of shortages of qualified personnel and related increases in our labor costs;

•
the risk that our records may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members;
•
our ability to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical expenses;
•
the impact of negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry;
•
the impact of weather and other factors beyond our control on our clinics, the centers out of which our external providers operate, and the facilities that host our AVA platform (as defined below);
•
the impact on our business of renegotiation, non-renewal or termination of risk agreements with hospitals, physicians, nurses, pharmacists and medical support staff;
•
risks associated with estimating the amount of liabilities that we recognize under our risk agreements with providers;
•
our ability to respond to general economic conditions, including but not limited to, increased inflation and higher interest rates; 
•
risks associated with an economic downturn, including pressure on governmental budgets and reduced spending for health and human service programs;
•
our ability to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting;
•
the impact of state and federal efforts to reduce Medicare spending;
•
our ability to comply with applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, including those relating to data privacy and security; and
•
other factors disclosed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under the sections entitled 
“Risk Factors”
 and 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
 in this Annual Report.
All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA
Unless otherwise indicated, information in this Annual Report concerning economic conditions, our industry, our markets and our competitive position is based on a variety of sources, including information from independent industry analysts and publications, as well as our own estimates and research. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. While we believe the information presented in this Annual Report is generally reliable, forecasts, assumptions, expectations, beliefs, estimates and projects involve risk and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those described under 
“Forward-Looking Statements” 
and 
“Risk Factors.”
Throughout this Annual Report, all references to “Net Promoter Score” or “NPS” are to a measure of satisfaction widely used in the healthcare industry. We calculate NPS based on responses to member surveys, conducted by a third-party administrator (either telephonically or online) that selects a random sample of members to participate. The surveys ask the consumer to rank, on a scale of one to 10, how likely the member would be to recommend Alignment to a friend or relative. We assign the designation of “Promoter” to respondents who provide a score of 9 or 10, the designation of “Neutral” to respondents who provide a score of 7 or 8, and the designation of “Detractor” to respondents who provide a score of 0 to 6. We then subtract the percentage of Detractors from Promoters to determine our overall Net Promoter Score. We believe that this method of calculation aligns with industry standards and that this metric is meaningful for investors because of the correlation between Net Promoter Score and consumer satisfaction.
Throughout this Annual Report, all references to the “Five-Star Rating System” or “Star rating” are to a measure used by the CMS to rate the performance of Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. Although subject to change, Medicare Advantage Plans are currently rated on how well they perform in five different categories: (1) staying healthy: screenings, tests, and vaccines, (2) managing chronic (long-term) conditions, (3) member experience with health plan, (4) member complaints and changes in the health plan’s performance,

and (5) health plan customer service. Similarly, Part D plans are currently rated on how well they perform in four different categories: (1) drug plan customer service, (2) member complaints and changes in the drug plan’s performance, (3) member experience with the drug plan, and (4) drug safety and accuracy of drug pricing. Ratings range from one to five stars, with five being the highest and one being the lowest. Plans are rated in each individual measure within the categories noted above and also at the category level. Medicare also assigns Medicare Advantage plans one summary star rating to summarize the plan’s performance on the Medicare Advantage measures, and assigns Part D plans a similar summary star rating. Medicare Advantage-Part D combined plans are also given an overall rating, which combines performance all measures. All ratings are reported at the contract level.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
We historically operated as a Delaware limited liability company under the name Alignment Healthcare Holdings, LLC. On March 17, 2021, Alignment Healthcare Holdings, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and changed its name to Alignment Healthcare, Inc. As a result of this conversion, Alignment Healthcare Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Alignment Partners”) and the sole unitholder of Alignment Healthcare Holdings, LLC, became the sole holder of shares of common stock of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. (the “Corporate Conversion”).
Prior to the closing of our initial public offering (“IPO”), (i) Alignment Healthcare, Inc. effected an approximately 1 for 260 split of its common stock (the “Stock Split”) and (ii) Alignment Partners merged with and into Alignment Healthcare, Inc., with Alignment Healthcare, Inc. surviving the merger (the “Company Merger”). Pursuant to the Company Merger, the partners of Alignment Partners received all of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. in exchange for their units in Alignment Partners. The Stock Split and Company Merger are collectively referred to herein as the “Corporate Reorganization.” Except as disclosed in this Annual Report, the consolidated financial statements and selected historical consolidated financial data and other financial information included in this Annual Report are those of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries and give effect to the Corporate Conversion and the Corporate Reorganization. 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Alignment,” the “Company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this annual report refer to Alignment Healthcare Holdings, LLC, its consolidated subsidiaries and its affiliated medical groups, for all periods prior to the Corporate Conversion and to Alignment Healthcare, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and its affiliated medical groups, for all periods following the Corporate Conversion.
We are a holding company and our sole asset is the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Alignment Healthcare USA, LLC.
