Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings. We believe that there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The results of any future claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and litigation costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. For a discussion of our material legal actions, including those not in the ordinary course of business, see "Legal Proceedings" in Note 14 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Market Information
Our common stock has been traded under the symbol “ALHC” on the Nasdaq Global Select Market since our initial public offering on March 26, 2021. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. 
As of February 20, 2025, there
 were approximately 54 holders of record of our common stock.
Dividend Policy
We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and to potentially repay any indebtedness and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to compliance with covenants in current and future agreements governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness, and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Our outstanding term loan restricts our ability to pay dividends. See the discussion of our term loan in “

Performance Graph
This performance graph below shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filing of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference therein.
The graph set forth below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock between March 26, 2021 (the date our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market) and December 31, 2024, with the cumulative total return of (a) the Nasdaq Healthcare Index and (b) the S&P 500, over the same period. This graph assumes the investment of $100 on March 26, 2021 in our common stock, the Nasdaq Healthcare Index, and the Nasdaq S&P 500 and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The graph assumes our closing sales price on March 26, 2021 of $17.31 per share as the initial value of our common stock and not the initial offering price to the public of $18.00 per share.

Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock
On March 25, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-253824) for the initial public offering of 27,200,000 shares of common stock was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our common stock began trading on March 26, 2021 on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ALHC.” The IPO closed on March 30, 2021, with us selling 21,700,000 shares of common stock and certain selling stockholders selling 5,500,000 shares of common stock, in each case at a price to the public of $18.00 per share. On April 6, 2021, pursuant to a partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, certain selling stockholders sold an additional 3,314,216 shares of common stock at the IPO price. In the aggregate, the IPO generated approximately $361.6 million in net proceeds for the Company, which amount is net of approximately $24.4 million in underwriters’ discounts and commissions and offering costs of approximately $4.6 million. The IPO commenced on March 25, 2021 and terminated upon the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment options as described above. The representatives of the several underwriters of the IPO were Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. 
There has been no material change in the use of proceeds described in the final IPO prospectus filed with the SEC on March 29, 2021. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies.
Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
