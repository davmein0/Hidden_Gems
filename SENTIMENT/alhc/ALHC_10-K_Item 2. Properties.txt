Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate office is located in Orange, California at 1100 W. Town and Country Rd, Suite 1600, where we lease approximately 47,321 square feet of office space under a lease that terminates in March 2030. We also have offices located in Raleigh, North Carolina; Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; El Paso, Texas; Sahuarita, and Tucson, Arizona; and Tampa, Florida. We also have small clinics located in Milpitas, Modesto and Downey, California; and Raleigh, North Carolina. We believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional space in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
