Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to approximately $8.1 billion of our common stock under a plan originally approved in 2013 and subsequently expanded, most recently in February 2023 (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions and may also repurchase shares in accelerated share repurchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or by other means. Repurchases may also be made under a plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions, our share price, legal requirements, restricted payment capacity under our debt instruments and other factors. The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued without prior notice.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1, “Business”, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K commencing on page F-1. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in tables are in millions.
 OVERVIEW
OUR COMPANY
We operate three of the most globally recognized brands in mobility solutions, Avis, Budget and Zipcar together with several other brands well recognized in their respective markets. We are a leading vehicle rental operator in North America, Europe, Australasia and certain other regions we serve, with an average rental fleet of approximately 695,000 vehicles in 2024. We also license the use of our trademarks to licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly. We and our licensees operate our brands in approximately 180 countries throughout the world.
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 can be found under Part II, Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at ir.avisbudgetgroup.com.
In 2024, we saw sustained volume, decreased revenue per day, and increased fleet and interest costs. This resulted in revenues of approximately $11.8 billion, a net loss of $1.8 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $628 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we changed our fleet strategy to accelerate certain fleet rotations in order to decrease the age of our fleet for competitive reasons, and accordingly, we shortened the useful life associated with such vehicles. Our net loss reflects $2.5 billion in long-lived asset impairment and other related charges, approximately $2.3 billion of which was recorded to reduce the carrying value of our rental fleet to its fair value in connection with this change. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Impairment of Long-lived Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We continue to be susceptible to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: interest rates, inflationary impact on items such as commodity prices and wages, cost of new vehicles, used car values, increases in the number of personal injury claims and cost per incident, and an economic downturn that may impact travel demand, all of which may be exacerbated by ongoing military conflicts, including in Eastern Europe. Additionally, uncertainty remains with respect to tariffs and tax regulations, and this uncertainty has had and may continue to have impacts on global stock markets and foreign exchange rates. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition, and future results of operations. Our strategy continues to primarily focus on customer experience and costs to strengthen our Company, maximize profitability, and deliver stakeholder value.

We measure performance principally using the following key metrics: (i) rental days, which represent the total number of days (or portion thereof) a vehicle was rented, (ii) revenue per day, which represents revenues divided by rental days, (iii) vehicle utilization, which represents rental days divided by available rental days, with available rental days being defined as average rental fleet times the number of days in the period, and (iv) per-unit fleet costs, which represent vehicle depreciation, lease charges and gain or loss on vehicle sales, divided by average rental fleet. Our rental days, revenue per day and vehicle utilization metrics are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a 24-hour period. We believe that this methodology provides management with the most relevant metrics in order to effectively manage the performance of the business. Our calculation may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled metrics by other companies. We present currency exchange rate effects to provide a method of assessing how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rate effects are calculated by translating the current-period results at the prior-period average exchange rate plus any related gains and losses on currency hedges.
We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the separate financial information of our operating segments. We aggregate certain of our operating segments into our reportable segments. In identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the management structure of the organization, the nature of services provided by our operating segments, the geographical areas and economic characteristics in which the segments operate, and other relevant factors. Management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as income (loss) from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization; long-lived asset impairment and other related charges; restructuring and other related charges; early extinguishment of debt costs; non-vehicle related interest; transaction-related costs, net; legal matters, net, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $5 million, related primarily to unprecedented self-insurance reserves for allocated loss adjustment expense, class action lawsuits and personal injury matters; non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity, which includes third-party advisory, legal and other professional fees; COVID-19 charges, net; cloud computing costs; other (income) expense, net; severe weather-related damages in excess of $5 million, net of insurance proceeds; and income taxes. 
We have revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude severe weather-related damages in excess of $5 million, net of insurance proceeds. We did not revise prior years' Adjusted EBITDA amounts because there were no other charges similar in nature to these. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows them to assess our results of operations and financial condition on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Revenues decreased $219 million or 2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in 2023, primarily due to a 3% decrease in revenue per day, excluding exchange rate effects and a $9 million negative impact from currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by a 1% increase in volume. Total expenses increased 43% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the similar period in 2023, primarily due to long-lived asset impairment and other related charges, higher per-unit fleet costs and higher interest costs. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Impairment of Long Lived Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were a benefit of 30.8% and a provision of 14.6%, respectively. As a result of these items, our net income decreased by $3.5 billion compared to the similar period in 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we reported diluted earnings (loss) per share of $(51.23) and $42.08, respectively.
Operating expenses increased to 51.0% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 47.3% during the similar period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in volume. Vehicle depreciation and lease charges increased to 25.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 14.5% during the similar period in 2023, primarily driven by higher per-unit fleet costs; adjusted depreciation on our rental fleet following a change in our fleet strategy, whereby we have accelerated certain fleet rotations and shortened the useful life associated with such vehicles; and a decrease in the gain on sale of vehicles. Selling, general and administrative costs were 11.5% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 11.7% during the similar period in 2023. Vehicle interest costs increased to 8.0% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 6.1% during the similar period in 2023, primarily due to rising interest rates.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs. These programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs. We believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets.

The increase in assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs compared to 2023 is principally related to the increase in operating lease right-of-use assets. See Note 3 – Leases to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The increase in liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs compared to 2023 is principally related to the increase in operating lease liabilities and corporate indebtedness from the issuance of senior notes. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” Note 3 – Leases and Note 13 – Long-term Corporate Debt and Borrowing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The decreases in assets and liabilities under vehicle programs are principally related to the decrease in the size and value of our vehicle rental fleet.
The decrease in stockholders’ equity compared to 2023 is principally related to our comprehensive loss.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities, as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities, each of which is discussed below.
In February 2024, we issued €600 million of 7.000% euro-denominated Senior Notes due February 2029, at par, with interest payable semi-annually. In April 2024, we used net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of our outstanding 4.750% euro-denominated Senior Notes due January 2026 plus accrued interest, with the remainder being used for general corporate purposes.
In May 2024, we issued an additional €200 million 7.250% euro-denominated Senior Notes due July 2030, at 100.25% of their face value, with interest payable semi-annually. Net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.
In September 2024, we issued $700 million of 8.250% Senior Notes due January 2030, at par, with interest payable semi-annually. In October 2024, we used net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding borrowings under our floating rate term loan due 2029, with the remainder being used to repay maturing vehicle-backed debt and for general corporate purposes.
39
Table of Contents

In February 2025, we borrowed $500 million under a floating rate term loan due December 2025, which is part of our senior revolving credit facilities.
During 2024, our Avis Budget Rental Car Funding (AESOP) subsidiary issued approximately $2.8 billion of asset-backed notes with expected final payment dates ranging from February 2026 to December 2029, and a weighted average interest rate of 6.04%. Avis Budget Rental Car Funding (AESOP) has also amended and extended its asset-backed variable-funding financing facilities, most recently in December 2024. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to fund the repayment of maturing vehicle-backed debt and the acquisition of rental cars in the United States. 
In January 2025, our Avis Budget Rental Car Funding (AESOP) LLC subsidiary issued an additional $358 million of asset-backed notes to investors with expected final payment dates ranging from August 2027 to February 2029 and a weighted average interest rate of 8.01%. These notes were issued under previously outstanding series of debt. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to fund the repayment of maturing vehicle-backed debt and the acquisition of rental cars in the United States.
In February 2024, we amended our European rental fleet securitization program to increase its capacity from €1.7 billion to €1.9 billion, to add £200 million to our capacity within the program, and to extend the maturity of the program from 2024 to 2026. The program is used to finance fleet purchases for certain of our European operations. 
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to approximately 
$8.1 billion
 of our common stock under a plan originally approved in 2013 and subsequently expanded, most recently in February 2023 (the “Stock Repurchase Program”).
 Our stock repurchases may occur through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, restricted payment capacity under our debt instruments and other factors. The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Stock Repurchase Program has no set expiration or termination date. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $45 million (excluding excise taxes due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) under the Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $757 million of authorization remained available to repurchase common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.

The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2024 compared with 2023 is primarily due to the increase in our net payments under vehicle programs, partially offset by the decrease in our common stock repurchases and the increase in our net corporate borrowings.
We anticipate that our non-vehicle property and equipment additions will be approximately $225 million in 2025.
Debt and Financing Arrangements
At December 31, 2024, we had approximatel
y $22.9 billion of indebtedness (including corporate indebtedness of approximately $5.4 billion and debt under vehicle programs of approximately $17.5 billion). For information regarding our debt and borrowing arrangements, see Note 1 – Basis of Presentation, Note 13 – Long-term Corporate Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 14 – Debt Under Vehicle Programs and Borrowing Arrangements
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIQUIDITY RISK
Our primary liquidity needs include the procurement of rental vehicles to be used in our operations, servicing of corporate and vehicle-related debt and the payment of operating expenses. The present intention of management is to reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely into our foreign operations. Our primary sources of funding are operating revenue, cash received upon the sale of vehicles, borrowings under our vehicle-backed borrowing arrangements and our senior revolving credit facility, and other financing activities.
Our liquidity has in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively affected by any financial market disruptions, a worsening of the United States and worldwide economies or by increases in interest rates, which may result in unfavorable conditions in the mobility industry, in the asset-backed financing market and in the credit markets generally. We believe these factors have affected and could further affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings. Additionally, a worsening or prolonged downturn in the worldwide economy or a disruption in the credit markets could further impact our liquidity due to (i) decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market, (ii) increased costs associated with, and/or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs, including due to a decrease in the fair value of our fleet, under, our financings, (iii) the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers being unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles and (iv) disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market (see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for further discussion).
As of December 31, 2024, we had $534 million of available cash and cash equivalents and access to $503 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing us with access to approximately $1.0 billion of total liquidity. Including our uncommitted facilities, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion.
Our liquidity position could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to remain in compliance with the consolidated first lien
 leverage ratio requirement and other covenants associated with our senior credit facilities and other borrowings. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our indebtedness. For additional information regarding our liquidity risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
For contractual obligations for material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as part of a liquidity and capital resources discussion, see Note 3 – Leases, Note 13 – Long-term Corporate Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, Note 14 – Debt Under Vehicle Programs and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Accounting Policies
The results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex. However, in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events and/or events that are outside of our control. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results. 
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets. 
We have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In performing this review, we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. When determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management’s projections of future cash flows, which include forecast of future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. When appropriate, comparative market multiples and other factors are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow results. A change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and, as such, could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount. In such event, we would then be required to record a charge, which would impact earnings. We review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are allocated among our reporting units. During 2024, we recorded $28 million in long-lived asset impairment and other related charges for impairment of one of our unamortized indefinite-lived intangible assets. During 2024, there was no impairment of goodwill. During 2023, there was no impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 – Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
Vehicles.
 We present vehicles at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record the initial cost of the vehicle, net of incentives and allowances from manufacturers. We acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs. For rental vehicles purchased under such programs, we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values. For risk vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs, we depreciate based on the vehicles’ estimated residual market values at their expected dates of disposition. The estimation of residual values requires us to make assumptions regarding the age and mileage of the vehicle at the time of disposal, as well as expected used vehicle market conditions. We regularly evaluate estimated residual values and adjusts depreciation rates as appropriate. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as part of vehicle depreciation and lease charges, net, at the time of sale. 
During 2024, we recorded $2.5 billion in long-lived asset impairment and other related charges related to vehicles, including an approximately $2.3 billion impairment charge related to the acceleration of rotation of our fleet and shortened useful life associated with such vehicles. During 2023, there was no long-lived asset impairment and other related charges. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 – Vehicle Rental Activities to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our vehicles. For a discussion of risk factors and assumptions relative to our vehicle valuations, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, included under Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Income Taxes. 
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Currently we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period.
See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 – Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes.
Public Liability, Property Damage and Other Insurance Liabilities.
 Insurance liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include supplemental liability insurance, personal effects protection insurance, public liability, property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self-insured. We estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include, but are not limited to, our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. The required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents for which we are ultimately liable and changes in the cost per incident. 
See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding public liability, property damage and other insurance liabilities.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of our adoption of new accounting pronouncements and the impact thereof on our business, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the impact thereof on our business, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. We manage our exposure to market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, particularly currency forward contracts to manage and reduce currency exchange rate risk; swap contracts, futures and options contracts, to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt; and derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded fuel prices.
We are exclusively an end user of these instruments. We do not engage in trading, market-making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk related to our use of derivatives through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience providing such derivative instruments.

Table of Contents

Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses discussed below. These “shock tests” are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. For additional information regarding our borrowings and financial instruments, see Note 13 – Long-term Corporate Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, Note 14 – Debt Under Vehicle Programs and Borrowing Arrangements and Note 20 – Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Currency Risk Management
We have exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars, the euro and British pound sterling. We use currency forward contracts and currency swap contracts to manage exchange rate risk that arises from certain intercompany transactions and from non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our currency forward contracts are often not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur. We anticipate that such currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future.
We assess our market risk based on changes in currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings, cash flows and fair values based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying currencies being hedged, against the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2024. With all other variables held constant, a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2024 earnings. Because unrealized gains or losses related to foreign currency forward and swap contracts are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged, when combined, these foreign currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Our primary interest rate exposure at December 31, 2024 was interest rate fluctuation in the United States due to its impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities. We use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We anticipate interest rate fluctuation will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future.
We assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. Based on our interest rate exposures and derivatives as of December 31, 2024, we estimate that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our 2024 earnings. Because gains or losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged, when combined, these interest rate contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commodity Risk Management
We have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of fuel. We anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future. We determined that a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not have a material impact on our earnings as of December 31, 2024.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of
Avis Budget Group, Inc.
Parsippany, New Jersey 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Avis Budget Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of
Avis Budget Group, Inc.
Parsippany, New Jersey 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Avis Budget Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Vehicles - Depreciation Expense - United States Risk Vehicles - Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company records rental vehicles at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of the vehicles is recorded net of incentives and allowances from manufacturers. Rental vehicles acquired by the Company outside of the manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs are referred to as risk vehicles and the carrying values of these risk vehicles are depreciated based upon the vehicles’ estimated residual values at their expected dates of disposition. The estimation of residual values for risk vehicles requires the Company to make assumptions regarding factors which include, but are not limited to, the anticipated age of the vehicles and market conditions for used vehicles at the time of disposal. The Company regularly evaluates estimated residual values and adjusts vehicle depreciation rates as appropriate. Any adjustments to depreciation are made prospectively.
Given the volume of risk vehicles in the United States and the significant estimation uncertainty and judgments made by management to calculate the estimated residual values of these risk vehicles, auditing the estimated residual values of the United States risk vehicles and related vehicle depreciation expense required extensive audit effort to develop an independent expectation of residual values and depreciation expense, and a high degree of auditor judgment was required when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to management’s assumptions regarding the impact of future consumer demand and general economic conditions on expected pricing of used vehicles. Additionally, auditing the calculation of the estimated residual values for United States risk vehicles was challenging due to the volume of data inputs utilized in management’s calculation, including historical sales data and data specific to the Company’s current fleet.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures to assess the reasonableness of the estimated residual values and vehicle depreciation expense related to United States risk vehicles included the following, among others:
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the Company’s methods, significant assumptions and judgments to calculate the estimated residual values of risk vehicles and the expected dates of disposition.
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over vehicle depreciation expense related to risk vehicles and management’s review of the significant assumptions and judgments to calculate the estimated residual values of risk vehicles, including those over the Company’s monitoring of residual values and used vehicle market conditions. 
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the estimated residual values of risk vehicles by performing the following procedures on a selection of risk vehicles:
–
We tested the underlying historical data that served as the basis for the Company’s calculation of the estimated residual values to evaluate the reasonableness of the inputs.
–
We tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s calculation of the estimated residual values and vehicle depreciation expense rates.
–
We tested significant assumptions and judgments used in the Company’s calculation by developing an independent expectation of residual values and compared them to the estimated residual values calculated by the Company. Our independent expectation was calculated using our professional judgment by reference to third-party data, information produced by the Company, subsequent vehicle sales, and inquiries of management.
–
We searched for contradictory evidence associated with the significant assumptions and judgments made by management based on our knowledge of the industry and review of third-party industry data.
•
We developed an independent expectation of depreciation expense based on, but not limited to, the vehicles’ age and results of our residual value testing and compared it to the amount recorded by the Company as depreciation expense.

Self-Insurance Reserves - Public Liability and Property Damage Claims - United States - Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The Company is self-insured for public liability and property damage claims. These self-insurance reserves represent an estimate for both reported claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported. The estimated reserve requirements for such claims are calculated on an undiscounted basis using actuarial methods and various assumptions which include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. The required liability is subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents for which the Company is ultimately liable and changes in the cost per incident.
Given the volume of public liability and property damage claims in the United States and the subjectivity of estimating the related self-insurance reserves for reported claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported due to the uncertain exposure and projected loss development, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether these self-insurance reserves were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2024 required a significant degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to United States public liability and property damage self-insurance reserves included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s review of significant assumptions, key inputs and methods used to calculate the estimate of the reported claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported.
•
We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test the reasonableness of the inputs to the actuarial estimate.
•
With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we developed an independent estimate of the self-insurance reserves, including assessment of loss data and claim development factors, and compared our estimate to management’s estimate. In addition, we performed the following:
–
Evaluated the reasonableness of the methodologies used in management’s estimate based on actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry associated with such liabilities.
–
Evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions used in management’s estimate by comparing prior-year assumptions of expected development and ultimate loss to actuals incurred during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of these liabilities.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets – United States Vehicles – Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. In the current year, the Company changed their fleet strategy for the United States and Canadian vehicles, to accelerate certain fleet rotations and shorten the useful life of the associated vehicles. As a result, the Company performed a recoverability test by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the impacted vehicles, to their carrying value and concluded, that for certain vehicles, the carrying value exceeded the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of those vehicles. For purposes of the recoverability test, the vehicles were aggregated into asset groups based on make, model and year of the vehicles. The test was performed as of November 30, 2024. The Company used a market approach to determine the fair value of the impacted vehicles, utilizing prices for similar assets in active markets (Level 2). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge.

Table of Contents

Given the volume of vehicles in the United States and the significant assumptions made by management to evaluate vehicles for impairment, we performed audit procedures to (1) evaluate whether management appropriately identified events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of vehicle assets may not be recoverable; (2) evaluate management's determination of asset groups at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows; (3) evaluate management’s recoverability test by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the impacted vehicles to their carrying value and, when applicable, (4) evaluate the fair value estimates for the impacted vehicles. Those procedures required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists and other professionals in our firm with expertise in long-lived asset impairment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to impairment of long-lived assets of United States vehicles included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) management’s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of vehicles may not be recoverable, including management’s review of forecasted future cash flows, and (2) management’s review of the methodology in determining the fair value estimate of vehicles.
•
We evaluated whether management appropriately identified events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amounts of vehicle assets may not be recoverable.
•
We evaluated management’s determination of asset groups at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
•
We tested management’s recoverability test by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the impacted vehicles to their carrying value by performing the following:
–
Tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s analysis.
–
Compared relevant information to historical data.
–
Assessed management’s assumptions used when determining the expected rental revenue, operating expenses and residual values expected at the time of disposition of vehicles as part of their recoverability test.
•
We tested the fair value estimates for the impacted vehicles.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology applied and fair value determined for vehicles by testing the methodology applied and measurable inputs used, and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.

Avis Budget Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts)

 1.    
Basis of Presentation
Avis Budget Group, Inc. provides mobility solutions to businesses and consumers worldwide. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts and transactions of Avis Budget Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as entities in which Avis Budget Group, Inc. directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest (collectively, “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”).
We operate the following reportable business segments:
•
Americas - 
consisting primarily of (i) vehicle rental operations in North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, (ii) car sharing operations in certain of these markets, and (iii) licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly. 
•
International - 
consisting primarily of (i) vehicle rental operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australasia, (ii) car sharing operations in certain of these markets, and (iii) licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly. 
We have completed the business acquisitions discussed in Note 6 – Acquisitions to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the acquired businesses are included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements from the dates of acquisition.
We present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs. These programs are distinct from our other activities since the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs. We believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets.
 2.    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of our Company and all entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest and variable interest entities for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. We consolidate joint venture activities when we have a controlling interest and record non-controlling interests within stockholders’ equity and the statement of comprehensive income equal to the percentage of ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling party. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The use of estimates and assumptions as determined by management is required in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP. These estimates are based on management’s evaluation of historical trends and other information available when the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and may affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We derive revenues primarily by providing vehicle rentals and other related products and mobility services to commercial and leisure customers, as well as through licensing of our rental brands. Other related products and mobility services include sales of collision and loss damage waivers, under which we agree to relieve a customer from financial responsibility arising from vehicle damage incurred during the rental; additional/supplemental liability insurance or personal accident/effects insurance products which provide 
F-13
Table of Contents

customers with additional protections for personal or third-party losses incurred; products for driving convenience such as fuel service options, roadside assistance services, electronic toll collection services, access to satellite radio, mobile WiFi devices, GPS navigation and child safety seat rentals; and rentals of other supplemental items including automobile towing equipment and other moving accessories and supplies. We also receive payment from customers for certain operating expenses that we incur, including airport concession fees that are paid by us in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations, as well as vehicle licensing fees. In addition, we collect membership fees in connection with our car sharing business. 
We combine all lease and non-lease components of our vehicle rental contracts for which the timing and pattern of transfer are the same and the lease component meets the classification of an operating lease. Vehicle rentals and other related products and mobility services are recognized evenly over the period of rental, which is on average approximately five days (See Note 3 – Leases).
Licensing revenues principally consist of royalties paid by our licensees and are recorded as the licensees’ revenues are earned (over the rental period). We renew license agreements in the normal course of business and occasionally terminate, purchase or sell license agreements. In connection with ongoing fees that we receive from our licensees pursuant to license agreements, we are required to provide certain services, such as training, marketing and the operation of reservation systems.
We exclude from the measurement of our transaction price any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer. As a result, revenue is recorded net of such taxes collected. Revenues and expenses associated with fuel, airport concessions and vehicle licensing are recorded on a gross basis within revenues and operating expenses. Membership fees related to our car sharing business are generally nonrefundable, are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of membership.
Revenues are recognized under Leases (Topic 842) with the exception of royalty fee revenue derived from our licensees and revenue related to our customer loyalty program, which were $
246
 million, $
187
 million, and $
165

Deferred Revenue
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, including amounts that are refundable. In addition, certain customers earn loyalty points on rentals, for which we defer a portion of our rental revenues generally equivalent to the estimated retail value of points expected to be redeemed. We estimate points that will never be redeemed based upon actual redemption and expiration patterns. Loyalty points generally expire 
five years
 from when they were earned or after 
12
 months of member inactivity. Future changes to expiration assumptions or expiration policy, or to program rules, may result in changes to deferred revenue as well as recognized revenues from the program.

Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at the prevailing monthly average rate of exchange. The related translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (See Note 16 – Stockholders' Equity). We have designated our euro-denominated Notes as a hedge of our investment in euro-denominated foreign operations and, accordingly, record the effective portion of gains or losses on this net investment hedge in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as part of currency translation adjustments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Program Cash and Restricted Cash
We consider highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Program cash primarily represents amounts specifically designated to purchase assets under vehicle programs and/or to repay the related debt, as such we consider it a restricted cash equivalent.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment (including leasehold improvements) are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation (non-vehicle related) is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. 
Useful lives are as follows:
Buildings

 years
Furniture, fixtures & equipment
3
 to 
10
 years
Capitalized software

 to 
7
 years
Buses and support vehicles

We capitalize the costs of software developed for internal use when the preliminary project stage is completed and management (i) commits to funding the project and (ii) believes it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. The software developed or obtained for internal use is amortized on a straight-line basis commencing when such software is ready for its intended use.

126
 million and $

 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess, if any, of the fair value of the consideration transferred by the acquirer and the fair value of any non-controlling interest remaining in the acquiree, if any, over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess it for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of their respective reporting units exceed their fair values. We perform our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level. We assess goodwill for such impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using the present value of expected future cash flows. When appropriate, comparative market multiples and other factors are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow results.
Other intangible assets, primarily trademarks, with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of this asset may exceed its fair value. If the carrying value of an other intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated each reporting period to determine if circumstances warrant a revision to these lives.
During our annual impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2024, we determined that the carrying value of our Zipcar trademark, which is an unamortized intangible asset included within our Americas reportable segment, exceeded its fair value. We determined the fair value of the Zipcar trademark using the relief-from-royalty method (Level 3), which is a form of the income approach. This method applies a royalty rate to projected income to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. The significant assumptions used in the assessment of the fair value of the trademark included future revenues, a discount rate and a royalty rate. As a result, we recognized an impairment of $
28
 million within 
long-lived asset impairment and other related charges
 in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. There was no impairment to goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2024 and there were no impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we changed our fleet strategy, specific to United States and Canadian rental car vehicles, to accelerate certain fleet rotations in order to decrease the age of our fleet for competitive reasons, and accordingly, we shortened the useful life associated with such vehicles. We considered this change in strategy to be a triggering event that indicated the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. As a result, we performed a recoverability test by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the impacted vehicles to their carrying value and concluded, that for certain vehicles, the carrying value exceeded the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of those vehicles. For purposes of the recoverability test, the vehicles were aggregated into asset groups based on make, model and year of the vehicles. The test was performed as of November 30, 2024, and we used a market approach to determine the value of the impacted vehicles, utilizing prices for similar assets in active markets (Level 2). During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $
2.3
 billion non-cash impairment within long-lived asset impairment and other related charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within our Americas reportable segment. There were 
no
 impairments to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Vehicles
Vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of the vehicles is recorded net of incentives and allowances from manufacturers. We acquire a portion of our rental vehicles pursuant to repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs established by automobile manufacturers. Under these programs, the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price and date, or guarantee the depreciation rate for a specified period of time, subject to certain eligibility criteria (such as car condition and mileage requirements). We depreciate vehicles such that the net book value on the date of return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values, thereby minimizing any gain or loss.
Rental vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs are depreciated based upon their estimated residual values at their expected dates of disposition, after giving effect to anticipated conditions in the used car market. Any adjustments to depreciation are made prospectively.
The estimation of residual values requires us to make assumptions regarding the age and mileage of the car at the time of disposal, as well as expected used vehicle auction market conditions. We regularly evaluate estimated residual values and adjust depreciation rates as appropriate. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as part of vehicle depreciation at the time of sale.
 Vehicle-related interest expense amounts are net of vehicle-related interest income of $
12
 million, $
34
 million, and $
1
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We classify vehicles as held for sale in the period in which they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale is probable. Vehicles held for sale are separately presented at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are no longer depreciated. We reassess their fair value each reporting period until disposed.
As of December 31, 2024, in connection with the change to our fleet strategy described above, we wrote down the carrying value of certain vehicles held for sale within our Americas reportable segment to fair value (Level 2). For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a charge of $
180
 million, which is included within 
long-lived asset impairment and other related charges
 in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We expect to complete the sale of these vehicles primarily through our standard disposition 
F-17
Table of Contents

channels during the first quarter of 2025. There were 
no
 similar charges during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. To the extent there are further changes in market conditions or the performance of our long-lived assets, there is a possibility that we could incur additional related costs in the future.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising and digital marketing costs are generally expensed in the period incurred and are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 During 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs were $
77
 million, $
86
 million, and $
64
 million, respectively. In addition, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, digital marketing costs were $
90
 million, $
86
 million, and $
71
 million, respectively.
Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As a result of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a component of current period income tax expense in the year incurred.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
Fair Value Measurements
We measure the fair value of assets and liabilities and disclose the source for such fair value measurements. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as follows: Level 1, which refers to assets and liabilities valued using quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, which refers to assets and liabilities for which significant other observable market inputs are readily available; and Level 3, which are valued based on significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value of our financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market (Level 1 inputs). In some cases where quoted market prices are not available, prices are derived by considering the yield of the benchmark security that was issued to initially price the instruments and adjusting this rate by the credit spread that market participants would demand for the instruments as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs). In situations where long-term borrowings are part of a conduit facility backed by short-term floating rate debt, we have determined that its carrying value approximates the fair value of this debt (Level 2 inputs). The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, receivables, program cash, and accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.
Our derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and commodity contracts, and are carried at fair value based on significant observable inputs (Level 2 inputs). Derivatives entered into by us are typically executed over-the-counter and are valued using internal valuation techniques, as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The valuation technique and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying exposure. We principally use discounted cash flows to value these instruments. These models take into account a variety of factors including, where applicable, maturity, currency exchange rates, our interest rate yield curves and counterparties, credit curves, counterparty creditworthiness and commodity prices. These factors are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable inputs where available.

Derivative Instruments
Derivative instruments are used as part of our overall strategy to manage exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel costs. As a matter of policy, derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in earnings within the same line item as the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative that is designated as either a cash flow or net investment hedge is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Amounts related to our derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the hedged item (principally operating activities).

Currency Transactions
Currency gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are generally included in operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations; however, the net gain or loss of currency transactions on intercompany loans and the unrealized gain or loss on intercompany loan hedges are included within interest expense related to corporate debt, net.
Self-Insurance Reserves
The Consolidated Balance Sheets include $
451
 million and $
397
 million of liabilities associated with retained risks of liability to third parties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Such liabilities relate primarily to public liability and third-party property damage claims, as well as claims arising from the sale of ancillary insurance products including, but not limited to, supplemental liability, personal effects protection and personal accident insurance. These obligations represent an estimate for both reported claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported. The estimated reserve requirements for such claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis utilizing actuarial methodologies and various assumptions which include, but are not limited to, our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. The required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents for which we are ultimately liable and changes in the cost per incident. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an unprecedented adjustment to our self-insurance reserves for allocated loss adjustment expense. These amounts are included within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets also include liabilities of $
50
 million and $
49
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to workers’ compensation, health and welfare and other employee benefit programs. 
The liabilities represent an estimate for both reported claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported, utilizing actuarial methodologies similar to those described above. These amounts are included within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Our policy is to record compensation expense for stock options, and restricted stock units that are time- and performance-based, for the portion of the award that vests. Compensation expense related to market-based restricted stock units is recognized provided that the requisite service is rendered, regardless of when, if ever, the market condition is satisfied. We estimate the fair value of restricted stock units using the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock-based and cash unit awards containing a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model include the stock price of the award on the grant date, the expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. The expected volatility is based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our publicly traded, near-the-money stock options, and the valuation period is based on the vesting period of the awards. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the 
F-19
Table of Contents

time of grant and, since we do not currently pay or plan to pay a recurring dividend on our common stock, the expected dividend yield was 
zero
.
Business Combinations
We use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized if fair value can be reasonably estimated at the acquisition date. The excess, if any, of (i) the fair value of the consideration transferred by the acquirer and the fair value of any non-controlling interest remaining in the acquiree, over (ii) the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Gains and losses on the re-acquisition of license agreements are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within transaction-related costs, net, upon completion of the respective acquisition. Costs incurred to effect a business combination are expensed as incurred, except for the cost to issue debt related to the acquisition. 
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is generally estimated by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation technique, based on a range of possible future results (Level 3). Any changes in contingent consideration are recorded in transaction-related costs, net.
Transaction-related Costs, net
Transaction-related costs, net are classified separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs are comprised of expenses primarily related to acquisition-related activities such as due-diligence and other advisory costs, expenses related to the integration of the acquiree’s operations with our own operations, including the implementation of best practices and process improvements, non-cash gains and losses related to re-acquired rights, expenses related to pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration related to acquisitions.
Investments
We account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not have a controlling interest, using the equity method of accounting and record our proportional share of net income or loss within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We assess equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. Any difference between the carrying value of the equity method investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment charge if the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had investments with a carrying value of $
100
 million and $
93
 million, respectively, recorded within other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Aggregate realized gains and losses on equity method investments and dividend income are recorded within operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net gains from our equity method investments, including dividend income of $
23
 million, $
12
 million, and $
12
 million, respectively. See Note 17 – Related Party Transactions for our equity method investment in our former subsidiary.
Divestitures
We classify long-lived assets and liabilities to be disposed of as held for sale in the period in which they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale is probable and expected to be completed within one year. We initially measure assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, and we reassess their fair value each reporting period until disposed. When the divestiture represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results, the disposal is presented as a discontinued operation.

In February 2022, we completed the sale of our operations in the United States Virgin Islands for $
13
 million, for the right to operate the Avis brand. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain of $
2
 million within restructuring and other related charges. The United States Virgin Islands operations were reported within our Americas reportable segment.
In March 2022, we completed the sale of our operations in the Netherlands for $
15
 million, for the right to operate the Avis and Budget brands. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss of $
7
 million, net of impact of foreign currency adjustments, within restructuring and other related charges. The Netherlands operations were reported within our International reportable segment.
Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) 
We review our investments to determine if they are VIEs. 
A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. 
Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary possesses the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that are significant to it. We will reconsider our original assessment of a VIE upon the occurrence of certain events such as contributions and redemptions, either by us, or third parties, or amendments to an entity’s governing documents. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider whether we are deemed to be a VIE’s primary beneficiary. See Note 17 – Related Party Transactions for our VIE investment in our former subsidiary.
Nonmarketable Equity Securities
We classify investments without readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as nonmarketable equity securities. The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. We apply the measurement alternative, which allows these investments to be recorded at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Any changes in value are recorded within operating expenses. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our nonmarketable equity securities within non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material and no material adjustments were made to the carrying values of these securities during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Reclassification
We reclassified certain items within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported net cash provided by operating activities.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
On January 1, 2024, as the result of a new accounting pronouncement, we adopted ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which amends Topic 280 primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement has resulted in incremental disclosures within the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
On January 1, 2025, as the result of a new accounting pronouncement, we adopted ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which amends Topic 740 primarily through enhanced income tax disclosures, improving transparency into the factors affecting income tax expense. We expect to include certain additional income tax disclosures in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement.
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,” which amends Topic 220 primarily through requiring disclosures, in the notes to financial statements, about certain costs and expenses. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted on a prospective or retrospective basis. ASU 2024-03 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reference Rate Reform
In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848),” which amends ASU 2020-04 and clarifies the scope and guidance of Topic 848 to allow derivatives impacted by the reference rate reform to qualify for certain optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting. The guidance is optional and is effective for a limited period of time. In December 2022, the FASB also issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,” to defer the sunset date of ASC 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have operating and finance leases for rental locations, corporate offices, vehicle rental fleet and equipment. Many of our operating leases for rental locations contain concession agreements with various airport authorities that allow us to conduct our vehicle rental operations on site. In general, concession fees for airport locations are based on a percentage of total commissionable revenue as defined by each airport authority, some of which are subject to minimum annual guaranteed amounts. Concession fees other than minimum annual guaranteed amounts are not included in the measurement of operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities and are recorded as variable lease expense as incurred. Our operating leases for rental locations often also require us to pay or reimburse operating expenses.
We lease a portion of our vehicles under operating leases. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have guaranteed up to $
30
 million and $
52
 million, respectively, of residual values for these vehicles at the end of their respective lease terms. We believe that, based on current market conditions, the net proceeds from the sale of these vehicles at the end of their lease terms will equal or exceed their net book values and therefore have not recorded a liability related to guaranteed residual values.

Diluted EPS was computed using the treasury stock method for non-vested stock. In computing diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2024, our number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes the effect of non-vested stock as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. This occurs when a net loss is reported and the effect of using dilutive shares would be anti-dilutive.
The following table summarizes our outstanding common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted EPS (shares in millions):

Restructuring and Other Related Charges
In 2024, we initiated a global restructuring plan to further right size our operations (“Global Rightsizing”). The costs associated with this initiative are primarily related to the operational scaling of processes, locations, and lines of business. We expect further restructuring expense of approximately $
70
 million related to this initiative to be incurred in 2025.
In 2022, we initiated a restructuring plan to focus on consolidating our global operations by designing new processes and implementing new systems (“Cost Optimization”). In 2021, we initiated a global restructuring plan to focus on cost discipline by reviewing headcounts, facilities and contractor agreements. We transformed our business as we exited the COVID-19 crisis by controlling fixed costs and matching variable costs to demand (“T21”). In 2020, we initiated a global restructuring plan to reduce operating costs, such as headcount and facilities, due to declining reservations and revenue resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak (“2020 Optimization”). In 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan to exit our operations in Brazil by closing rental facilities, disposing of assets and terminating personnel (“Brazil”). We also initiated a restructuring plan in that same year to drive global efficiency by improving processes and consolidating functions, and to create new objectives and strategies for our truck rental operations in the United States by reducing headcount, large vehicles and rental locations (“T19”). These initiatives are complete.

Other Related Charges
In April 2022, we announced the departure of Veresh Sita as Executive Vice President and Chief Digital and Innovation Officer effective May 13, 2022. In connection with Mr. Sita’s separation, we recorded other related charges of approximately $
1
 million, inclusive of accelerated stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Acquisitions
McNicoll Vehicle Hire
In September 2023, we completed the acquisition of McNicoll Vehicle Hire, a vehicle rental company in Scotland specializing in van and car rentals, for approximately $
17
 million, net of acquired cash. The investment enabled us to expand our footprint of vehicle rental services in Scotland. The excess of the purchase price over preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which was assigned to our International reportable segment. In connection with this acquisition, approximately $
10
 million was recorded to goodwill, $
4
 million was recorded to trade names, and $
1
 million was recorded to customer relationships. The trade names and customer relationships will be amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately 
10
 years. The goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes. In 2024, we finalized our accounting for this acquisition. As a result, we recorded an additional $
2
 million to the goodwill connected to this acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2024, which represents the additional excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Licensees
In June 2023, we completed the acquisition of a licensee in North America for approximately $
14
 million, plus approximately $
20
 million for acquired fleet. In October 2023, we completed the acquisition of a second licensee in North America for approximately $
10
 million, plus approximately $
4
 million for acquired fleet. These investments were in-line with our strategy to re-acquire licensees when advantageous to expand our footprint of Company-operated locations. The acquired fleet for each acquisition was financed under our existing financing arrangements. In connection with these acquisitions in June 2023 and October 2023, approximately $
14
 million and $
10
 million, respectively, was recorded to other intangibles related to license agreements, which are being amortized over weighted average useful lives of approximately 
five years
 and 
three years
, respectively. Differences between the preliminary allocation of purchase prices and the final allocations for these acquisitions were not material.

At December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
3.0
 billion. The net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite utilization period pursuant to the Tax Act. Such net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to accelerated depreciation of our U.S. vehicles. Currently, we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period. At December 31, 
F-31

2024, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
890
 million, the majority of which has an indefinite utilization period. 
At December 31, 2024, we had undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
1.6
 billion that we have indefinitely reinvested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

(a)
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reclassified (
0.4
%) of certain tax credits to conform to the current year presentation. This reclassification had no impact to our reported effective income tax rate.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) published a proposal for the establishment of a global minimum tax rate of 15% (the “Pillar Two rule”), effective for fiscal 2024. We are closely monitoring developments of the Pillar Two rule as the OECD continues to refine its technical guidance and member states implement tax laws and regulations based on Pillar Two proposals. Pillar Two did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2024.
The following is a reconciliation of the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits:

We do not anticipate the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in 2025.
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, the 2007 through 2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the federal tax authorities. The 2012 through 2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by various state tax authorities. In significant foreign jurisdictions, the 2012 through 2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities.

Debt due to Avis Budget Rental Car Funding
. Avis Budget Rental Car Funding, an unconsolidated bankruptcy remote qualifying special purpose limited liability company, issues privately placed notes to investors as well as to banks and bank-sponsored conduit entities. Avis Budget Rental Car Funding uses the proceeds from its note issuances to make loans to our wholly-owned subsidiary, AESOP Leasing LP (“AESOP Leasing”), on a continuing basis. AESOP Leasing is required to use the proceeds of such loans to acquire or finance the acquisition of vehicles used in our rental car operations. By issuing debt through the Avis Budget Rental Car Funding program, we pay a lower rate of interest than if we had issued debt directly to third parties. Avis Budget Rental Car Funding is not consolidated, as we are not the “primary beneficiary” of Avis Budget Rental Car Funding. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not have the obligation to absorb the potential losses or receive the benefits of Avis Budget Rental Car Funding’s activities since our only significant source of variability in the earnings, losses or cash flows of Avis Budget Rental Car Funding is exposure to our own creditworthiness, due to our loan from Avis Budget Rental Car Funding. Because Avis Budget Rental Car Funding is not consolidated, AESOP Leasing’s loan obligations to Avis Budget Rental Car Funding are reflected as related party debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also have an asset within Assets under vehicle programs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets which represents securities issued to us by Avis Budget Rental Car Funding. AESOP Leasing is consolidated, as we are the “primary beneficiary” of AESOP Leasing; as a result, the vehicles purchased by AESOP Leasing remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determined we are the primary beneficiary of AESOP Leasing, as we have the ability to direct its activities, an obligation to absorb a majority of its expected losses and the right to receive the benefits of AESOP Leasing’s activities. AESOP Leasing’s vehicles and related assets, which as of December 31, 2024, appro
xim
ate $
17
 billion and some of which are subject to manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements, collateralize the debt issued by Avis Budget Rental Car Funding. The assets and liabilities of AESOP Leasing are presented 
F-37
Table of Contents

on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within assets under vehicle programs and liabilities under vehicle programs, respectively. The assets of AESOP Leasing, included within assets under vehicle programs (excluding the investment in Avis Budget Rental Car Funding (AESOP) LLC—related party) are restricted. Such assets may be used only to repay the respective AESOP Leasing liabilities, included within Liabilities under vehicle programs, and to purchase new vehicles, although if certain collateral coverage requirements are met, AESOP Leasing may pay dividends from excess cash. The creditors of AESOP Leasing and Avis Budget Rental Car Funding have no recourse to our general credit. We periodically provide Avis Budget Rental Car Funding with non-contractually required support, in the form of equity and loans, to serve as additional collateral for the debt issued by Avis Budget Rental Car Funding. 
The business activities of Avis Budget Rental Car Funding are limited primarily to issuing indebtedness and using the proceeds thereof to make loans to AESOP Leasing for the purpose of acquiring or financing the acquisition of vehicles to be leased to our rental car subsidiaries and pledging its assets to secure the indebtedness. Because Avis Budget Rental Car Funding is not consolidated by us, its results of operations and cash flows are not reflected within our financial statements.

During December 2024, Avis Budget Rental Car Funding issued additional notes under several previously outstanding series of debt.
We used the proceeds from these borrowings to fund the repayment of maturing vehicle-backed debt and the acquisition of rental cars in the United States. Borrowings under the Avis Budget Rental Car Funding program primarily represent fixed rate notes and had a weighted average interest rate of 
5.04
% and 
4.99
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively.

Debt borrowings
. We finance the acquisition of vehicles used in our Canadian rental operations through a consolidated, bankruptcy remote special-purpose entity, which issues privately placed notes to investors and bank-sponsored conduits. We finance the acquisition of fleet for our truck rental operations in the United States through a combination of debt facilities and leases. These debt borrowings represent a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and had a weighted average interest rate of 
5.78
% and 
5.77
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
We entered into a repurchase agreement (the “Repurchase Facility”) in September 2024, whereby we may sell our Class D notes issued by Avis Budget Rental Car Funding to the Repurchase Facility counterparty and repurchase such notes. Transactions under the Repurchase Facility have a

International
Debt borrowings
. In EMEA we operate a European rental fleet securitization program which is used to finance fleet purchases for certain of our European operations. In February 2024, we amended our European rental fleet securitization program to increase its capacity from €
1.7
 billion to €
1.9
 billion, to add £
200
 million to our capacity within the program, and to extend the maturity of the program from 2024 to 2026. The International borrowings primarily represent floating rate notes and had a weighted average interest rate of 
5.07
% and 
5.51
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Finance leases. 
We obtain a portion of our International vehicles under finance lease arrangements. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 
5.07
% and 
3.68
% respectively. All finance leases are on a fixed repayment basis and interest rates are fixed at the contract date.

Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies
In 2006, we completed the spin-offs of our Realogy and Wyndham subsidiaries (now known as Anywhere Real Estate, Inc., and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Inc. and Travel + Leisure Co., respectively). We do not believe that the impact of any resolution of pre-existing contingent liabilities in connection with the spin-offs should result in a material liability to us in relation to our consolidated financial position or liquidity, as Anywhere Real Estate, Inc., Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Inc. and Travel + Leisure Co. have agreed to assume responsibility for these liabilities. 
In March 2023, the California Office of Tax Appeals (“OTA”) issued an opinion in a case involving notices of proposed assessment of California corporation franchise tax for tax year 1999 issued to us. The case involves whether (i) the notices of proposed assessment were barred by the statute of limitations; and (ii) a transaction undertaken by us in tax year 1999 constituted a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). The OTA concluded that the notices of proposed assessment were not barred by the statute of limitations and that the 1999 transaction was not a tax-free reorganization under the IRC. Anywhere Real Estate, Inc. has assumed 
62.5
%, and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Inc. and Travel + Leisure Co. have assumed 
37.5
% of the potential tax liability in this matter, respectively. We filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied in April 2024, and the tax assessment is expected to become payable, even if judicial relief is sought. 
We are also named in litigation that is primarily related to the businesses of our former subsidiaries, including Realogy and Wyndham. We are entitled to indemnification from such entities for any liability resulting from such litigation.
F-40
Table of Contents

In September 2014, Dawn Valli et al. v. Avis Budget Group Inc., et al. was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiffs seek to represent a purported nationwide class of certain renters of vehicles from our Avis and Budget subsidiaries from September 30, 2008 through the present. The plaintiffs seek damages in connection with claims relating to alleged misrepresentations and omissions concerning charging customers for traffic infractions and related administrative fees. In October 2023, plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was denied as to their proposed nationwide class and granted as to a subclass, created at the Court’s discretion, of Avis Preferred and Budget Fastbreak members. We have been named as a defendant in other purported consumer class action lawsuits, including 
two
 class actions filed against us in New Jersey, 
one
 seeking damages in connection with a breach of contract claim and another related to ancillary charges at our Payless subsidiary. However, the Company intends to vigorously defend them.
We are currently involved, and in the future may be involved, in claims and/or legal proceedings, including class actions, and governmental inquiries that are incidental to our vehicle rental and car sharing operations, including, among others, contract and licensee disputes, competition matters, employment and wage-and-hour claims, insurance and liability claims, intellectual property claims, business practice disputes and other regulatory, environmental, commercial and tax matters. 
We are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings for personal injury arising from the operation of our vehicles. In June 2023, 
two
 of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in Dallas, Texas alleging that 
one
 of our employees caused the death of an individual with 
one
 of our vehicles: Peggy Dawson Edwards, Individually and as Anticipated Representative of the Estate of Michael Edwards, Sr., et. al. v. Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC; PV Holding Corp.; and Kevin Barnes, Cause No. CC-23-03188-E, pending in County Court at Law No. 5 for Dallas County, Texas. The complaint alleges that our subsidiaries are responsible for Mr. Edwards’ death and seeks compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount exceeding $
1
 million. The court has set a trial date in May 2025 for this lawsuit. Given the early stages of the legal proceedings, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the claim. However, the Company intends to vigorously defend it.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable and, although we believe that our accruals are adequate and/or that we have valid defenses in these matters, unfavorable resolutions could occur. We estimate that the potential exposure resulting from adverse outcomes of current legal proceedings in which it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred could, in the aggregate, be up to approximately $
40
 million in excess of amounts accrued as of December 31, 2024. We do not believe that the impact should result in a material liability to us in relation to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Commitments to Purchase Vehicles
We maintain agreements with vehicle manufacturers under which we have agreed to purchase approximately $
6.3
 billion of vehicles from manufacturers over the next 
12
 months, a $
0.5
 billion decrease compared to December 31, 2023, financed primarily through the issuance of vehicle-backed debt and cash received upon the disposition of vehicles. Certain of these commitments are subject to the vehicle manufacturers satisfying their obligations under their respective repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements.
Other Purchase Commitments
In the normal course of business, we make various commitments to purchase other goods or services from specific suppliers, including those related to marketing, advertising, computer services and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $
145
 million of purchase obligations, which extend through 2029.
Concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2024, include (i) risks related to our repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements with domestic and foreign car manufacturers and primarily with respect to receivables for program cars that have been disposed, but for which we have not yet received payment from the manufacturers and (ii) risks related to Realogy and Wyndham, including receivables of $
39
 million and $
24
 million, respectively, related to certain contingent, income tax and other corporate liabilities assumed by Realogy and Wyndham in connection with their disposition.
F-41
Table of Contents

Asset Retirement Obligations
We maintain a liability for asset retirement obligations. An asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform certain activities in connection with the retirement, disposal or abandonment of assets. Our asset retirement obligations, which are measured at discounted fair values, are primarily related to the removal of underground fuel storage tanks at our rental facilities. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for asset retirement obligations of $
25
 million and $
27
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Standard Guarantees/Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into numerous agreements that contain standard guarantees and indemnities whereby we agree to indemnify another party, among other things, for performance under contracts and any breaches of representations and warranties thereunder. In addition, many of these parties are also indemnified against any third-party claim resulting from the transaction that is contemplated in the underlying agreement. Such guarantees or indemnifications are granted under various agreements, including those governing (i) purchases, sales or outsourcing of assets, businesses or activities, (ii) leases of real estate, (iii) licensing of trademarks, (iv) access to credit facilities and use of derivatives and (v) issuances of debt or equity securities. The guarantees or indemnifications issued are for the benefit of the (i) buyers in sale agreements and sellers in purchase agreements, (ii) landlords in lease contracts, (iii) licensees under licensing agreements, (iv) financial institutions in credit facility arrangements and derivative contracts and (v) underwriters and placement agents in debt or equity security issuances. While some of these guarantees extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement, many may survive the expiration of the term of the agreement or extend into perpetuity (unless subject to a legal statute of limitations). There are no specific limitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees, nor are we able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees as the triggering events are not subject to predictability. With respect to certain of the aforementioned guarantees, such as indemnifications provided to landlords against third-party claims for the use of real estate property leased by us, we maintain insurance coverage that mitigates our potential exposure.
 16.    
Stockholders' Equity
Cash Dividend Payments
During 2024 and 2022, we did 
no
t declare or pay any cash dividends. In December 2023, we paid a special cash dividend of $
10.00
 per share to all holders of our common stock as of December 15, 2023, totaling 
$
355
 million
. Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock is limited by our senior credit facility, the indentures governing our senior notes and our vehicle financing programs. 
Share Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to approximately $
8.1
 billion of our common stock under a plan originally approved in 2013 and subsequently expanded most recently in February 2023 (the “Stock Repurchase Program”).
 During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 
21.6
 million
 shares of common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program at a cost of approximately 
$
4.2
 billion
 (excluding excise taxes due for 2024 and 2023 repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
$
757
 million
 of authorization remained available to repurchase common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.

Related Party Transactions
SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC
In 2021, SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC acquired a 33 1/3% Class A Membership Interest in one of our subsidiaries at fair value of $
37.5
 million. SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC is an affiliate of our largest shareholder, SRS Investment Management, LLC.
On September 1, 2022, through the issuance of Class B Preferred Voting Membership Interests, SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC increased their ownership in this subsidiary to 
51
% at fair value of $
62
 million. In accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-40, we must deconsolidate a subsidiary as of the date we cease to have a controlling interest in that subsidiary and recognize the gain or loss in net income at that time. The fair value of our retained investment was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology based on various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, which include forecast of future revenue and EBITDA. As a result, we deconsolidated our former subsidiary, Avis Mobility Ventures LLC (“AMV”), from our financial statements and began to report our proportional share of the former subsidiary’s income or loss within other (income) expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as we no longer had the ability to direct the significant activities of the former subsidiary and were no longer primary beneficiary of the VIE. Upon deconsolidation in 2022, our former subsidiary had a net asset carrying amount of $
49
 million and we recorded a gain within other (income) expense, net. In August and October 2023, SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC made capital contributions to AMV, increasing their ownership to approximately 
65
%. In June 2024, SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC made a capital contribution of approximately $
22
 million to AMV, and we simultaneously settled approximately $
12
 million in receivables from AMV related to services we provided. SRS Mobility Ventures, LLC’s ownership percentage remained at approximately 
65
% following these transactions.

Stock-Based Compensation
Our Amended and Restated Equity and Incentive Plan provides for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other stock- or cash-based awards to employees, directors and other individuals who perform services for us and our subsidiaries. The maximum number of shares reserved for grant of awards under the plan is 
22.5
 million
, with 
3.6
 million shares available as of December 31, 2024. We typically settle stock-based awards with treasury shares.
Time-based awards generally vest ratably over a 
three-year
 period following the date of grant, and performance-based awards generally vest 
three years
 following the date of grant based on the attainment of performance goals, both of which are subject to a service condition.
Stock Unit Awards
Stock unit awards entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock upon vesting on a one-to-one basis, and certain performance-based RSUs vest based upon the level of performance attained.
As part of our declaration and payment of a special cash dividend in December 2023, we granted additional RSUs to our award holders with unvested shares as a dividend equivalent, which has been deferred until, and will not be paid unless, the shares of stock underlying the award vest.

Employee Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Savings Plans
We sponsor several defined contribution savings plans in the United States and certain foreign subsidiaries that provide certain of our eligible employees an opportunity to accumulate funds for retirement. We match portions of the contributions of participating employees on the basis specified by the plans. Our contributions to these plans were $
31
 million, $
29
 million, and $
26
 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the United States and in certain foreign subsidiaries with some plans offering participation in the plans at the employees’ option. Under these plans, benefits are based on an employee’s years of credited service and a percentage of final average compensation. However, the majority of the plans are closed to new employees and participants are no longer accruing benefits.

To select discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of such plans, to yield curves constructed from portfolios of AA-rated fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yields of the hypothetical portfolios as a discount rate benchmark.
Our expected rate of return on plan assets of 
6.25
% and 
5.97
% for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, used to determine pension obligations and pension costs, are long-term rates based on historic plan asset returns in individual jurisdictions, over varying long-term periods combined with current market expectations and broad asset mix considerations.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations of $
330
 million and $
350
 million, respectively, and plan assets of $
236
 million and $
246
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had accumulated benefit obligations of $
327
 million and $
346
 million, respectively, and plan assets of $
236
 million and $
246
 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for all plans was $
561
 million and $
615
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $
3
 million to the plans in 2025.
Our defined benefit pension plans’ assets are invested primarily in mutual funds and may change in value due to various risks, such as interest rate and credit risk and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of the pension plans’ investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes would materially affect the amounts reported in our financial statements.
The defined benefit pension plans’ investment goals and objectives are managed by us or Company-appointed and member-appointed trustees with consultation from independent investment advisors. While the objectives may vary slightly by country and jurisdiction, collectively we seek to produce returns on pension plan investments, which are based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that we believe are prudent and reasonable, given prevailing capital market conditions. The pension plans’ assets are managed in the long-term interests of the participants and the beneficiaries of the plans. A suitable strategic asset allocation benchmark is determined for each plan to maintain a diversified portfolio, taking into account government requirements, if any, regarding unnecessary investment risk and protection of pension plans’ assets. We believe that diversification of the pension plans’ assets is an important investment strategy to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the pension plans. As such, we allocate assets among traditional equity, fixed income (government issued securities, corporate bonds and short-term cash investments) and other investment strategies.
The equity component’s purpose is to provide a total return that will help preserve the purchasing power of the assets. The pension plans hold various mutual funds that invest in equity securities and are diversified 
F-47
Table of Contents

among funds that invest in large cap, small cap, growth, value and international stocks as well as funds that are intended to “track” an index, such as the S&P 500. The equity investments in the portfolios will represent a greater assumption of market volatility and risk as well as provide higher anticipated total return over the long term. The equity component is expected to approximate 
35
%-
55
% of the plans’ assets.
The purpose of the fixed income component is to provide a deflation hedge, to reduce the overall volatility of the pension plans’ assets in relation to the liability and to produce current income. The pension plans hold mutual funds that invest in securities issued by governments, government agencies and corporations. The fixed income component is expected to approximate 
35
%-
55
% of the plans’ assets.
The purpose of the alternative investment component is to provide diversification and risk reduction through less correlated investment strategies with the goal of enhanced returns and downside protection. Alternative strategies will not be used if they are designed solely to enhance return and/or employ significant leverage. Diversification of asset categories, investment styles and managers is central to managing investment risk. The alternative investment component is expected to approximate 
5
%-
15
% of the pl
ans’ assets.

Multiemployer Plans
We contribute to a number of multiemployer plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover a portion of our employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; (iii) if we elect to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, we may be required to contribute to such plan an amount based on the under-funded status of the plan; and (iv) we have no involvement in the management of the multiemployer plans’ investments. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we contributed $
10
 million, $
10

8

Financial Instruments
Risk Management
Currency Risk
. We use currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates associated with certain of our non-U.S.-dollar denominated receivables and forecasted royalties, forecasted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and forecasted non-U.S. dollar denominated acquisitions. We primarily hedge a portion of our current-year currency exposure to the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars, the euro and the British pound sterling. The majority of forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts do, however, largely offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk they economically hedge. We have designated our euro-denominated notes as a hedge of our investment in euro-denominated foreign operations. 
The estimated net amount of existing gains or losses we expect to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings for cash flow and net investment hedges over the next 12 months is not material.
Interest Rate Risk
. We use various hedging strategies including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to create what we deem an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities. We use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage the risk related to our floating rate corporate debt and our floating rate vehicle-backed debt. We record the changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. We record the gains or losses related to freestanding derivatives, which are not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes, currently in earnings and are presented in the same line of the income statement expected for the hedged item. We estimate that approximately $
20
 million of gain currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. 
Commodity Risk.
 We periodically enter into derivative commodity contracts to manage our exposure to changes in the price of fuel. These instruments were designated as freestanding derivatives and the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings and are presented in the same line of the income statement expected for the hedged item.
Credit Risk and Exposure
. We are exposed to counterparty credit risks in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to various agreements and sales transactions. We manage such risk by evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties and by requiring collateral in certain instances in which financing is provided. We mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts by monitoring the amount for which we are at risk with each counterparty, periodically evaluating counterparty creditworthiness and financial position, and where possible, dispersing our risk among multiple counterparties.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties at December 31, 2024 or 2023, other than (i) risks related to our repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements with domestic and foreign car manufacturers, and primarily with respect to receivables for program cars that were disposed but for which we have not yet received payment from the manufacturers (see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), (ii) receivables from Realogy and Wyndham related to certain contingent, income tax and other corporate liabilities assumed by Realogy and Wyndham in connection with their disposition, and (iii) risks related to leases which have been assumed by Realogy but of which we are a guarantor. Concentrations of credit risk associated with trade receivables are considered minimal due to our diverse customer base. We do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales.

Segment Information
Our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) assesses performance and allocates resources based upon the separate financial information of our operating segments. We aggregate certain of our operating segments into our reportable segments. In identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the management structure of the organization, the nature of services provided by our operating segments, the geographical areas and economic characteristics in which the segments operate, and other relevant factors.
F-51
Table of Contents

Our CODM evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as income (loss) from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization; long-lived asset impairment and other related charges; restructuring and other related charges; early extinguishment of debt costs; non-vehicle related interest; transaction-related costs, net; legal matters, net, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $
5
 million, related primarily to unprecedented self-insurance reserves for allocated loss adjustment expense, class action lawsuits and personal injury matters; non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity, which includes third-party advisory, legal and other professional fees; COVID-19 charges, net; cloud computing costs; other (income) expense, net; severe weather-related damages in excess of $
5
 million, net of insurance proceeds; and income taxes. 
We have revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude severe weather-related damages in excess of $
5
 million, net of insurance proceeds. We did not revise prior years' Adjusted EBITDA amounts because there were no other charges similar in nature to these. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows them to assess our results of operations and financial condition on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
