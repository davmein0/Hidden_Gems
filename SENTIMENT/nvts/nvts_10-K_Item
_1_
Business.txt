Industry Overview
Most electronic devices that connect to a wall socket require a power supply to convert energy provided by utilities at 100-240V alternating current (AC) into lower-voltage direct current (DC) required by most electronic devices. Power supplies can be located inside the devices they are powering, as is the case with many consumer electronics and home appliances, or outside of the device, as is typically the case with devices like mobile phone chargers or laptop computers, typically referred to as wall chargers or power adapters. 
In other applications such as electric vehicles, power may be converted from a high-voltage (e.g. 400 or 800V) DC battery to a lower voltage (e.g. 12 V) or, in the case of solar inverters, from low-voltage DC to high-voltage AC.
Additional, even-higher voltage applications are evolving, such as grid-tied converters, circuit breakers, rail, wind turbines, and industrial-scale charging (megawatt) systems.
In electronic devices today, most of these charging and power supply functions are carried out using silicon (Si) power MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) or IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), along with related analog peripheral semiconductors. As the electronic content and functionality of systems have increased over time, existing silicon-based solutions have struggled to achieve high energy efficiency and fast charging, and they require large heat sinks or other thermal management methods, and large or complex form factors.
Two newer “wide band-gap” (WBG) materials have entered the power electronics market—gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). In general terms, devices rated around 700V address applications requiring output power of approximately 20 W to 20 kW, such as smartphone chargers or data center power supplies. GaN devices rated from 80-120 V optimize and enable 48 V-based systems such as AI data centers, EV, and AI robotics. Silicon Carbide (SiC) solutions are generally designed for higher power (multi kW to MW+) applications with higher device voltages (up to 6,500 V).

At the highest level, GaN is a combination of gallium and nitrogen, which forms a powerful bond with materially stronger electric fields and greater electron mobility compared to silicon. With a GaN power IC, increased power system switching speeds and energy efficiency can be achieved, which translate into notable benefits for power electronics such as smaller size, lighter weight, higher density, faster charging, energy savings and ultimately a lower system cost. These are significant gains relative to existing Si-based power solutions. A transistor is at the heart of a power supply, and a discrete (that is, non-integrated) GaN transistor requires a specialized silicon driver and multiple other components to drive and protect that GaN transistor. This additional circuitry has limited the adoption of GaN over the last decade due to cost, complexity, size, and vulnerability to system transients. Navitas has solved this problem with the GaN power IC. The Company is the first to integrate all the drive and protection components along with the GaN transistor in a single GaN chip. This provides several form-factor improvements and energy savings compared to silicon solutions. The GaN IC solution also provides several benefits compared to GaN discrete solutions, including a smaller footprint, fewer components, energy savings, and lower cost.
A new, ‘bi-directional’ GaN platform began sampling in 2024, and represents significant size and system-cost reductions, for solar, motor drive and battery-storage applications.
Based on third-party estimates, the GaN device market (all voltages) in 2023 was over $250 million, with a 41% CAGR to 2029, and with the SiC market in 2023 over $2.7 billion. Based on Navitas’ estimate, Navitas is a market leader in high-voltage (600-700V) GaN, and is focused on growing market share in SiC. As new, displacement technologies, GaN and SiC market revenues are expected to grow faster than the legacy silicon market.
Combining GaN and SiC, the total potential market opportunity is estimated to be over $22 billion per year by 2026, split $7 billion for GaN, $9.3 billion for SiC, and with $6.1 billion overlapping GaN/SiC market. By the end of 2029, Yole, which is a consulting firm that specializes in the strategic analysis of markets, estimates that 33% of the legacy power silicon market will have been taken by GaN and SiC.
Company Overview
Converting power efficiently has emerged as a critical challenge as the electrification of our planet continues amid the pursuit of reduced carbon footprints. Electric vehicles, renewable energy, large-scale data processing and other applications all demand power and charging infrastructures with greater speed and efficiency than status-quo silicon technology. Navitas’ GaN and SiC products solve complex and demanding challenges that are inherent in power conversion by unlocking both speed and efficiency. Since our founding in 2014, we have successfully harnessed the fundamentally superior material properties of GaN to enable cost savings and enhanced power conversion through product integration, reducing the amount of space needed to support multiple requirements while dramatically increasing charging speeds. With ten-times stronger electrical fields and twice the electron mobility compared to silicon, GaN is ideally suited for disrupting power switching applications, but challenges around manufacturing quality and reliability make commercialization difficult. By developing a fully qualified manufacturing process with over one billion device hours tested, Navitas overcame these key hurdles to successfully and reliably integrate the critical drive, control and protection circuits into a single chip, enabling mainstream GaN adoption and unlocking the full potential of GaN in speed, efficiency, simplicity and cost. Navitas estimates show that GaN-based power systems can provide 20x faster switching, up to 3x higher power density, 3x faster charging, up to 40% energy savings and are 3x smaller and lighter compared to silicon-based power systems. Navitas’ ICs allow end customers to implement GaN technology with a simple, dependable solution to realize groundbreaking power density and efficiency. We are developing a differentiated GaN power IC platform utilizing decades of power semiconductor technical expertise, robust applications knowledge and strong end customer relationships. We believe our competitive strengths and robust IP portfolio of over 180 issued and pending GaN patents (over 300 company-wide) enabled us to establish a leading market position in GaN power semiconductors.
In August 2022, Navitas acquired GeneSiC Semiconductor, adding a broad range of SiC MOSFETs and diodes to the Navitas portfolio. GeneSiC proprietary trench-assisted planar-grade MOSFET technology combines the best of planar SiC (ease of manufacturing, robustness) with the best of trench SiC (low resistance, smaller die sizes). Navitas SiC MOSFETs have lower resistance than competitors at higher temperatures, and operate at cooler temperatures, for expected 3x longer device life expectancy.

Navitas’ Market Opportunities
We believe GaN and SiC will continue to displace silicon-based power semiconductors in a broad range of markets ranging from mobile/consumer to home appliance/industrial, data center, solar/storage, and EV. These markets are driven by major, long-term secular trends including explosive growth in data traffic, increasing electricity cost, and the transition from fossil fuel-based to sustainable energy sources to help address climate change. Industry analyst Yole estimates that by the end of 2029, GaN and SiC will have replaced 33% of the legacy silicon market.
•
Mobile/Consumer. 
With short design-in times, and a strong “portability” value proposition, our initial focus and technology beachhead for GaN was the mobile fast and ultra-fast charging market for smartphones, tablets and laptops. GaN Power ICs generally can provide up to 3x more power and up to 3x faster charging, with half the size and weight of silicon chargers with the same output power. With the introduction of USB Type-C universal connectors and charging protocols, and as smartphone screen size, batteries and functions have increased, demand for high-power “ultra-fast” chargers has been established. For example, GaN-based 240 W chargers supplied with today’s flagship smartphones can enable 0-100% charging in less than 10 minutes. As over 2.5 billion chargers are shipped every year, each estimated to include potentially approximately $1 of GaN content, the mobile charger market represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity based on estimates from IDC PC tracker, USB-C research, Yole research and Navitas estimates. As of December 2023, all of the top-10 mobile OEMs were in production or development with Navitas, and repeat orders have continued, with some customers reaching up to 30% adoption of GaN vs. legacy silicon-based chargers in 2024. Non-mobile (non-battery) applications include ultra-thin TVs, high-powered gaming systems, desktop all-in-one PCs, and various smart home internet-connected devices.

Data Center.

For AI and hyperscale, the key demands are total power, power density and operating costs. As GPUs from NVIDIA (e.g. Hopper, Blackwell & Rubin) and others accelerate in power need to over 1 kW, total rack power demand is increasing from 30 kW to 60 kW, with a roadmap to 480 kW per rack. At the same time, little to no extra space is allocated to the 220V-AC-to-48V-DC ‘silver box’ power supplies. Here, no-compromise, hybrid SiC+GaN solutions deliver robust, high efficiency, high power density reference designs are available from Navitas’ data center design center, in power levels at 3kW, 4.5kW, 8.5 kW and beyond. In Q4 2024, a GaN-IP cross-licensing arrangement with Infineon Technologies AG enabled drop-in, ‘dual sourcing’ and is expected to accelerate GaN’s adoption in in AI data centers, plus access to a new, low-voltage (80-120V) platform addresses 48V applications, and doubles the potential revenue up to $10 per kilowatt of power demand. In addition, nearly 50% of the total cost of ownership of a data center is related to power, which includes the cost of power supplies as well as the cost of electricity for data processing, cooling, lighting and other power needs. For the data processing component alone, by our estimates a GaN enables a 40% reduction in losses versus legacy silicon-based systems.

Solar/Storage
. 
In residential solar, we believe GaN is well positioned to replace silicon in per-panel micro-inverters (350 – 550 W). Based on customer feedback, we estimate system cost reductions of approximately 25% compared to legacy silicon solutions, in addition to efficiency-driven energy savings over time. We estimate this translates into about a 10% improvement in the return on investment in solar systems. Overall, we estimate the GaN IC opportunity for solar applications to be over $1 billion per year based on Markets and Markets Micro-Inverter Market report and Navitas analysis. GaN revenue is expected to begin in 2025, starting with standard GaNFast power ICs, then upgrading to a new ‘Bi-directional’ GaN platform for further efficiency upgrades, size and component count reductions. Meanwhile, higher-power, higher-voltage commercial “string” inverters have adopted SiC to replace legacy silicon IGBTs, with significant savings in weight and size. To help balance solar supply and electrical demand, and for users to become more grid-independent, the “attach rate” for battery-based energy-storage designs (or “bi-directional” EV) that require SiC, is expected to increase from less than 10% in 2022 to 30%-40% in 2025, according to a leading customer. 
•
Home Appliance / Industrial.

This market is dominated by high-efficiency motor drive applications, including domestic appliances such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dishwasher pumps, refrigerator compressors and heat pumps, plus industrial uses such as water pumps, conveyor systems, robots, and warehouse materials handling systems. Based on Navitas estimates, high-speed GaN half-bridge power ICs deliver improved energy savings compared to legacy silicon and enable drive-motor integration due to their smaller size and lighter weight. We estimate the opportunity for GaN in 50-300 W motor drive applications to be around $1.5 billion per year. As motor drive power increases to over 1 hp (~750 W), the higher current-handling capabilities of SiC come into play.

Electric Vehicles
. 
EV demand is increasing, with battery-electric passenger cars expected to be 25% of sales in 2025 and 50% by 2031[i]. EV adoption challenges include three main themes: the need for faster charging, demand for extended range, and lowering the cost compared to traditional, internal combustion powered cars. EVs can also act as supplementary energy back-up for your home to balance energy supply (from household AC, solar, generators) and demand (heating, cooling, cooking, device charging and other electronics), and be a critical part of an energy-independent micro-grid in the event of a grid power failure. This is known as “V2x” (vehicle to anything) charging. For 400 V-rated EV battery systems, and where 220VAC home charging is available, ~700 V-rated GaN operates at high-speeds in on-board chargers (OBCs) and DC-DC converters. For example, Navitas’ “3-in-1” platform design includes a 6.6 kW bi-directional charge/discharge and consolidated DC-DC converter. For higher-power traction inverters, and systems with 800 V-rated batteries, 1,200 V SiC is an optimized solution. We estimate GaN and SiC content per passenger EV to be approximately $350 per vehicle. For long-haul trucking, the USA and 26 other countries signed the COP27 MoU, committing to 30% Zero-emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040, so a significant ramp in production is anticipated. A new “Megawatt Charging System” (SAE J3271) is being finalized that will fast-charge with up to 3.5 MW of power using a 1,500V cable – requiring high-voltage SiC, where Navitas leads the industry with devices up to 6,500V.
Competitive Strengths
At December 2024, over 240 million Navitas GaN and nearly 30 million SiC devices had shipped, with proven quality and field-reliability performance (failure rates of far less than one part per million). We believe Navitas is the market and technology leader in high-voltage GaN power ICs, with leading revenue, technology and intellectual property. We believe our key competitive advantages include:

Leadership in Sustainability.
 Through Navitas analysis and third-party auditing, we estimate that each GaN power IC shipped saves a net 4 kg of CO2 emissions, and each SiC MOSFET saves 25kg. To date, over 350,000 tons of CO2 emissions have been saved by GaN alone, as compared to legacy silicon solutions providing the same power output. Overall, by the target date of the Paris Accord, we estimate that GaN and SiC can reduce CO2 emissions by over 6 Gtons per year. Navitas was the first semiconductor producer solely focused on GaN and SiC products to publish a quantitative, third-party-verified sustainability report, and the first semiconductor company worldwide to be certified CarbonNeutral® by Climate Impact Partners. Each customer can adapt the CO2 footprint-reduction value of GaN and SiC to achieve their own sustainability analysis and commitments.

We believe our PDK includes the industry’s first and most mature and comprehensive device and circuit development libraries, characterization and verification tools, and robust simulation models.
Competition
Our competitors include suppliers of silicon-based as well as GaN-based and SiC-based power semiconductors. Most suppliers of GaN-based devices today offer discrete (i.e., non-integrated) GaN solutions, which require silicon-based and other components for drive, control and protection. These solutions, even though they offer some benefits compared to silicon, still do not capture all the advantages of a GaN integrated power IC that Navitas provides. Our primary GaN competitors include Infineon Technologies AG, Power Integrations, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Innoscience (Suzhou) Semiconductor Co., Ltd., Renesas Electronics Corp., and Efficient Power Conversion Corporation (EPC). Primary SiC competitors include Infineon, Wolfspeed, Inc., ON Semiconductor Corporation, ROHM Co., Ltd., Qorvo, Inc., and STMicroelectronics International N.V. 
Our primary silicon-based power semiconductor competitors include Infineon, STMicroelectronics, ON Semiconductor and Power Integrations, among others. Silicon-based power devices are still the incumbent solutions used for power applications and currently have a lower-cost advantage. However, given the speed, power and size advantages of an integrated GaN IC over a silicon solution, coupled with expected cost reductions, we estimate that system cost parity for GaN-based (vs. silicon-based) mobile chargers with output power of 65 W or above was reached in 2023. In higher-power systems, such as kW-level data center supplies, we believe the cost-parity point was reached even earlier, based on customer feedback.
Although we believe system cost parity for these GaN-based applications was reached in 2023, there are inherent risks that market conditions may change, which include:
•
GaN wafer and assembly (packaging) prices may not be reduced by suppliers as fast as expected or committed, especially if global semiconductor shortages occur.
•
GaN manufacturing yields, while demonstrated over 90% on a stable, multi-month basis, could deteriorate causing manufacturing costs of GaN ICs to increase.
•
The cost of silicon controllers, which are an important complement to GaN power ICs used in all mobile chargers, is expected to decrease, but price increases could occur, particularly if global semiconductor shortages occur. Such costs are not directly controlled by Navitas.
•
Passive and mechanical components (inductors, transformers, capacitors, printed circuit boards (PCBs), plastic housings, and others) are an important complement to GaN power ICs, are used in all mobile chargers and contribute to cost reduction as they generally decrease in size, weight and cost as GaN increases charger switching frequency compared to silicon-based chargers. Although we expect these cost reductions for passive and mechanical components to continue, it is possible that they will not materialize as expected, and such costs are not directly controlled by Navitas.
Even in the absence of shortages in the semiconductor industry, corresponding components in silicon-based chargers may increase, allowing GaN-based chargers to achieve expected system cost parity on a relative basis.
Manufacturability
We utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products.

BLE OF CONTENTS
Navitas devices are fabricated in a layer of GaN sitting on a silicon substrate (known as “GaN-on-Si”). This combination traditionally posed several challenges due to physical dissimilarities in the materials and resulting defect densities, which translated into poor manufacturing, low yields, high costs, and poor reliability. We have spent a significant amount of our history working to solve these problems through process and design improvements and test methods. As a result of these efforts, we have achieved stable, predictable, and consistent yields of well over 90%. 
Gallium is produced primarily as a byproduct from the production of bauxite, the chief ore of aluminum. In 2017 world production capacity was estimated at over 1,000 tons (low-grade and refined), and is estimated to be growing at about 15% per year, with a supply potential of over 2,000 tons sourced from many countries. Semiconductor applications dominate the commercial demand for gallium, representing 98% of its use, which includes microwave circuits, ultra high-speed logic chips, LEDs, laser diodes and, as is the case for Navitas GaN power ICs, in power electronics. Gallium is not considered a rare or precious metal. GaN power ICs typically use only 95 µg (micrograms) of gallium in the manufacture of a device. On this basis we estimate Navitas will consume less than .01% of the 2,000 tons estimated annual supply potential by 2026.
Our GaN wafer fab partner since inception has been Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). We have worked to co-develop GaN-based product manufacturing capabilities with TSMC, which has invested significant capital to develop this capability. Although we have no volume-contracted commitments with TSMC, and purchase wafers on a purchase-order basis, we believe our volumes of GaN products in TSMC wafer fabs are critical to the utilization and efficiency of TSMC’s GaN-specific infrastructure. TSMC operates as a leading global supplier, with significant capacity to meet our growth needs. Our process is compatible with multiple complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (“CMOS”) foundries with the addition of a small number of GaN-specific process modules. Navitas’ SiC products are manufactured by XFAB Texas, Inc. on 150 mm wafers, with high yields and lead times we believe are around half that of competitors. In 2023, Navitas entered into long-term supply agreements with XFAB and raw wafer suppliers to establish capacity increases.
Research & Development
Navitas has invested its time and effort to carefully develop its proprietary GaN IC chips for power electronics and semiconductor applications. Our experienced teams around the world have made GaN adoption a reality as many end customers in different end markets start to realize the true potential of our GaN power ICs. To protect our market leadership in GaN ICs, we continually look to innovate and improve our GaN ICs, to achieve greater efficiency, integration and speed at lower costs. We evaluate various complementary technologies, look to improve our PDK and hope to keep introducing newer generations of GaN technology. In 2022, Navitas acquired GeneSiC Semiconductor for SiC MOSFETs and diodes with plans to accelerate research and development and adoption of the expansive GeneSiC SiC portfolio. Navitas’ research and development activities are located primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan.
Sustainability
We believe we are the first company to publish a sustainability report that comprehensively quantifies the positive impact of GaN power semiconductors on climate change based on global standards. Our report includes a third-party Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) of GaN technology according to ISO14040/14044, the international standard for assessing environmental impacts throughout a product’s life cycle—from raw material acquisition through production, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling and final disposal. The Navitas report also quantifies corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts through 3rd party assessments. We estimate that each GaN power IC shipped saves a net 4 kg of CO
2
 emissions, and each SiC MOSFET saves 25 kg. Combined, GaN and SiC are estimated to save an aggregate of 6 Gtons of CO
2
 emissions per year by 2050.
