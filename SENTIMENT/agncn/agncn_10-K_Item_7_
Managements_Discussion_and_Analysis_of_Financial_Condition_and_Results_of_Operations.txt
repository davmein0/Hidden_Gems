________________________________
* Except as noted below, average numbers for each period are weighted based on days on our books and records. 
1.
Net book value per common share is calculated as total stockholders' equity, less preferred stock liquidation preference, divided by number of common shares outstanding as of period end.
2.
Tangible net book value per common share excludes goodwill.
3.
Includes net TBA dollar roll position and, if applicable, forward settling securities.
4.
The carrying value of our net TBA position represents the difference between the market value and the cost basis of the TBA contract as of period-end and is reported in derivative assets/(liabilities), at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balances sheets.
5.
Amount represents the daily weighted average repurchase agreements outstanding for the period used to fund our investment securities and other debt. Amount excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements and TBA contracts. Other debt includes debt of consolidated VIEs. 
6.
Average stockholders' equity calculated as average month-ended stockholders' equity during the period. 
7.
Average tangible net book value "at risk" leverage is calculated by dividing the sum of daily weighted average repurchase agreements used to fund our investment securities, other debt, and TBA and forward settling securities (at cost) (collectively "mortgage borrowings") outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill for the period. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements.
8.
Tangible net book value "at risk" leverage as of period end is calculated by dividing the sum of mortgage borrowings outstanding and receivable/payable for unsettled investment securities as of period end by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill as of period end. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements.
9.
Economic return on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared per share of common stock during the period over beginning tangible net book value per common share.

Economic Interest Income and Asset Yields
The following table summarizes our economic interest income (a non-GAAP measure) for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, which includes the combination of interest income (a GAAP measure) on our holdings reported as investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets, adjusted to exclude estimated "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments for the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to changes in our CPR forecast, and implied interest income on our TBA securities (dollars in millions):

Implied interest income from TBA dollar roll transactions is computed as the sum of (i) TBA dollar roll income and (ii) estimated TBA implied funding cost (see 
Economic Interest Expense and Aggregate Cost of Funds
 below). TBA dollar roll income represents the price differential, or "price drop," between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement and is the economic equivalent to interest income on the underlying Agency securities, less an implied funding cost, over the forward settlement period. Amount is net of TBAs used for hedging purposes. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments.
3.
The combined asset yield is calculated on a weighted average basis based on our average investment and TBA balances outstanding during the period and their respective yields.
4.
30-year fixed rate mortgage rates are sourced from Optimal Blue. 10-year U.S. Treasury rates are sourced from Bloomberg.
The principal elements impacting our economic interest income are the average size of our investment portfolio and the average yield on our securities. The following table includes a summary of the estimated impact of each of these elements on our economic interest income for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 compared to the prior year period (in millions):

Our average investment portfolio (at cost), inclusive of TBAs, increased 9% and decreased 11% for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to changes in our capital base. The average yield on our investment portfolio, including TBA implied asset yields and excluding "catch-up" premium amortization, increased 59 and 111 basis points for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, largely as a result of shifting our asset portfolio from lower coupon holdings toward a greater share of higher coupon, specified pools.
Leverage
Our primary measure of leverage is our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage ratio, which is measured as the sum of our repurchase agreements and other debt used to fund our investment securities and net TBA and forward settling securities position (at cost) (together referred to as "mortgage borrowings") and our net receivable/payable for unsettled investment securities, divided by our total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill.
We include our net TBA position in our measure of leverage because a forward contract to acquire Agency RMBS in the TBA market carries similar risks to Agency RMBS purchased in the cash market and funded with on-balance sheet liabilities. Similarly, a TBA contract for the forward sale of Agency securities has substantially the same effect as selling the underlying Agency RMBS and reducing our on-balance sheet funding commitments. (Refer to 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
in this Form 10-K for further discussion of TBA securities and dollar roll transactions). Repurchase agreements used to fund short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities ("U.S. Treasury Repo") are excluded from our measure of leverage due to the temporary and highly liquid nature of these investments. The following table presents a summary of our leverage ratios for the periods listed (dollars in millions):

3.
The implied funding cost (benefit) of TBA dollar roll transactions is determined using the price differential, or "price drop," between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement and market based assumptions regarding the "cheapest-to-deliver" collateral that can be delivered to satisfy the TBA contract, such as the anticipated collateral’s weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity and projected 1-month CPR. The average implied funding cost (benefit) for all TBA transactions is weighted based on our daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period. 
4.
The combined cost of funds for total mortgage borrowings outstanding, before interest rate swap periodic income, is calculated on a weighted average basis based on average investment securities repurchase agreements, other debt and TBA securities outstanding during the period and their respective cost of funds.
5.
Interest rate swap periodic income is measured as a percent of average mortgage borrowings outstanding for the period. 
The principal elements impacting our economic interest expense are (i) the size of our average mortgage borrowings and interest rate swap portfolio outstanding during the period, (ii) the average interest rate on our mortgage borrowings and (iii) the average net interest rate paid/received on our interest rate swaps. The following table includes a summary of the estimated impact of these elements on our economic interest expense for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 compared to the prior year period (in millions):

Our average mortgage borrowings, inclusive of TBAs, increased 11% and decreased 13% for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, consistent with changes to our average investment portfolio. The average interest rate on our mortgage borrowings, excluding the impact of interest rate swap periodic income, increased 18 and 372 basis points for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to higher short-term interest rates. 
Interest rate swap periodic income declined for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 primarily due to higher pay rates on our pay-fixed swaps largely driven by the maturity of low cost interest rate swaps. The following is a summary of our interest rate swaps outstanding during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions). Amounts exclude forward starting swaps not yet in effect.

For fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had an average forward starting net pay-fixed rate swap balance of $672 million, $43 million and $48 million, respectively. Forward starting interest rate swaps do not impact our economic interest expense and aggregate cost of funds until they commence accruing net interest settlements on their forward start dates.
