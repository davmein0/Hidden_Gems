PART II. 
Item 5. 
Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "AGNC." As of January 31, 2025, 900,421,216 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, which were held by 1,491 stockholders of record. Most of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders. 
Dividends
We intend to pay dividends monthly to our common stockholders and to continue to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected for the reasons described under the caption "Risk Factors." Additionally, holders of depositary shares underlying our preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends before holders of our common stock are entitled to receive any dividends. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a description of our preferred stock and for common and preferred stock dividends paid for the three years ended December 31, 2024. All distributions to stockholders will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our REIT status and other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.

Performance Graph 
The following graph and table compare a stockholder's cumulative total return, assuming $100 invested at December 31, 2019, with the reinvestment of all dividends, as if such amounts had been invested in: (i) our common stock; (ii) the stocks included in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index ("S&P 500"); and (iii) the stocks included in the FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REIT Index. In prior years, we compared the cumulative total return on our common stock with that of the S&P 500 and the Bloomberg Mortgage REIT Index; however, the Bloomberg Mortgage REIT Index was discontinued in February 2024 and consequently we are not able to include it in the graph.
