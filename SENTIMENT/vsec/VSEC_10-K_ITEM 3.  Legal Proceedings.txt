ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

We may have certain claims in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings against us and against other parties. In our opinion, the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, because the results of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.
Further, from time-to-time, government agencies investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable contractual and regulatory requirements. Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Holders
As o
f
 February 3, 2025, VSE common stock, par value $0.05 per share, was held by approximately 196 stockholders of record. The number of stockholders of record is not representative of the number of beneficial holders because many of VSE's shares are held by depositories, brokers or nominees.
Dividends
Pursuant to our credit agreement, as discussed in Note (7) "Debt" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K, the payment of cash dividends is subject to annual restrictions. We have paid cash dividends each year since 1973.
Certain Sales and Repurchases of VSE Common Stock
During the fiscal year covered by this Form 10-K, we acquired Turbine Controls, Inc. ("TCI") on April 24, 2024 and Kellstrom Aerospace Group, Inc. ("Kellstrom Aerospace") on December 3, 2024. The purchase price of these acquisitions consisted of a combination of cash consideration and in-kind payment in the form of shares of the Company's common stock (127,268 shares and 172,414 shares were issued in connection with the acquisition of TCI and Kellstrom Aerospace, respectively). The common stock issued in connection with both acquisitions was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder, as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. See Note (2) "Acquisitions" for further information. 
During the fiscal year covered by this Form 10-K, no purchases of equity securities of VSE were made by or on behalf of VSE or any "affiliated purchaser" (as defined in Rule 10b-18 (a)(3) under the Exchange Act) other than 34,233 shares of our common stock that were voluntarily forfeited to VSE by participants in its 2006 Restricted Stock Plan (the "2006 Plan") to cover their personal tax liability for vesting stock awards under the 2006 Plan.

Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024.
Business Overview
VSE Corporation, through its subsidiaries (collectively, "VSE," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), is a leading provider of aftermarket distribution and maintenance, repair and overhaul ("MRO") services for air and land transportation assets for commercial and government markets. Our operations are conducted within two reportable segments aligned with our operating segments: Aviation and Fleet. 
Recent Developments
Sale of Federal and Defense Segment
In February 2024, we entered into two separate agreements to sell substantially all of the Federal and Defense segment assets ("FDS Sale"). We have reported the results of operations for the Federal and Defense segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note (3) "Discontinued Operations" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
Sale of Fleet Segment
In February 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell the Fleet segment. See Note (19) "Subsequent Event" for further information.
2024 Acquisitions
In April 2024, we completed the acquisition of Turbine Controls, Inc. ("TCI"), a leading provider of aftermarket MRO support services for complex engine components, as well as engine and airframe accessories, across commercial and military applications.
In December 2024, we completed the acquisition of Kellstrom Aerospace Group, Inc. ("Kellstrom Aerospace"), a diversified global distributor and service provider supporting the commercial aerospace engine aftermarket.
See Note (2) "Acquisitions" to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Underwritten Public Offerings
In May 2024, we initiated a public offering of the Company's common stock relating to the issuance and sale of 2,429,577 shares at a public offering price of $71.00 per share. The offering closed in two transactions, and net proceeds of $162.0 million were received by the Company, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, including amounts borrowed to pay the purchase price of the TCI acquisition and for general corporate purposes. 
In October 2024, we initiated a public offering of the Company's common stock relating to the issuance and sale of 1,982,757 shares at a public offering price of $87.00 per share. The offering closed on October 17, 2024, and net proceeds of $163.8 million were received by the Company, which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Kellstrom Aerospace acquisition and repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. 
See Note (15) "Capital Stock" to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Business Trends

The following discussion provides a brief description of some of the key business factors impacting our results of operations detailed by segment.
-19-
Table of Contents
Aviation Segment
Our strong program execution of new and existing distribution awards, our expanded portfolio of MRO capabilities and contributions from recent acquisitions resulted in record revenue of $786 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a 45% increase year-over-year. Distribution and repair revenue increased 27% and 86%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Growth of our distribution business was driven by strong execution of new and existing programs, and contributions from recent acquisitions. Our repair business's growth was driven by the expansion of new repair capabilities, market share gains in the commercial and business and general aviation ("B&GA") markets, improved throughput across our MRO facilities, and contributions from the TCI acquisition. In 2024, we ramped up several multi-year distribution and repair programs for both domestic and new international markets, including an expansion of our flagship distribution agreement with Pratt & Whitney Canada supporting Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. These new programs are expected to drive sustainable and recurring revenue with growth opportunities, contributing to future positive results. 
Investments in the Aviation segment are focused on businesses and programs that broaden our portfolio of products, expand our repair capabilities and reach new customers and geographies. The April 2024 acquisition of TCI strengthens our position in the commercial aviation engine MRO aftermarket, while providing additional opportunities for organic growth. The December 2024 acquisition of Kellstrom Aerospace improves our position in the commercial aviation engine aftermarket, expands our aftermarket product and capability offerings, and broadens our global footprint. The Aviation segment is expected to see continued growth due to progress on new and existing programs, an expansion of repair capabilities, and synergies from recent acquisitions.
Fleet Segment
Our Fleet segment continues to see growth in revenue from commercial fleet customers and e-commerce fulfillment, as the segment moves towards revenue diversification. Fleet is executing its revenue diversification strategy by continuing to scale our Olive Branch, MS, e-commerce fulfillment distribution facility, acquiring new customers, and expanding product options for our commercial business. Commercial customer revenue continues to experience strong growth, increasing 18% in 2024 compared to the prior year. We anticipate continued growth as we extend our reach to meet the increasing demand from the commercial market. In 2024, commercial revenues were 61% of total Fleet segment revenue compared to 48% in 2023, demonstrating the continued success of our revenue diversification strategy. The United States Postal Services ("USPS") revenue in 2024 decreased 30%, as compared to the prior year. During 2024, USPS elected to migrate all of their vehicle maintenance facilities ("VMFs") to a new Fleet Management Information System ("FMIS"), resulting in a temporary decline in maintenance activity. The transition to the new FMIS was completed in the third quarter of 2024. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, maintenance activity has begun to improve, which has resulted in increased demand for our parts. We remain committed to supporting the USPS as they emerge from their FMIS conversion.

Revenues.

Revenues increased $219.6 million, or 26%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to revenue growth in our Aviation segment of $242.2 million, partially offset by a decline in our Fleet segment of $22.6 million. See "Segment Operating Results" section below for further discussion of revenues by segment. 
Costs and Operating Expenses.
 Costs and operating expenses increased $226.2 million, or 29%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Costs and operating expenses for our operating segments increase and decrease in conjunction with the level of business

activity and revenues generated by each segment. See "Segment Operating Results" section below for further discussion of costs and operating expenses by segment. 
Operating Income.

Operating income decreased $6.6 million, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily attributable to an increase in corporate costs, including net lease abandonment and termination charges of $12.2 million, corporate restructuring charges of $4.2 million, and acquisition-related expenses incurred in connection with current year acquisitions, and a decrease in operating income for our Fleet segment of $14.2 million. These operating income decreases were partially offset by an increase of $30.2 million for our Aviation segment. See "Segment Operating Results" section below for further discussion of operating income by segment.
Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased approximately $3.9 million, or 12% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in our average debt facility borrowings during the current period.
Provision for Income Taxes.

The effective tax rate for continued operations was 21.5% in 2024 compared to 24.2% in 2023. The decrease in our effective tax rate primarily resulted from a favorable excess stock tax deduction and lower pre-tax book income in 2024. 
Our tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but may not be consistent from year to year. In addition to state income taxes, certain federal and state tax credits and permanent book-tax differences such as foreign derived intangible income ("FDII") deduction, I.R.C. Section 162(m) executive compensation limitation and unrealized investment income or loss from our COLI plan caused differences between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate.

Revenues.
 Revenues increased $242.2 million, or 45%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Distribution revenue increased $106.3 million, or 27%, driven by strong program execution on new and existing distribution programs and contributions from the acquisitions of Desser Aerospace (July 2023) and Kellstrom Aerospace (December 2024). Repair revenue increased $135.9 million, or 86%, driven by an expansion of repair capabilities, improved end market demand, share gains with commercial and B&GA customers, and contributions from the acquisition of TCI (April 2024). 
Costs and Operating Expenses.
 Costs and operating expenses increased $212.0 million, or 45%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above. In addition, costs and operating expenses for this segment included expenses for amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions and allocated corporate costs. Expense for amortization of intangible assets increased $5.9 million in 2024 to $17.6 million from $11.7 million in 2023 driven by newly acquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in the current year. Expense for allocated corporate costs was $18.5 million for 2024 as compared to $12.9 million for 2023.
Operating Income.
 Operating income increased $30.2 million, or 42%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to revenue growth and a favorable shift in sales mix and pricing, partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization and allocated corporate costs.

Revenues.
 Revenues decreased $22.6 million, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in revenues from other government customers of $50.1 million, or 30%, partially offset by an increase in revenues from commercial customers of $27.7 million, or 18%. Revenues from other government customers decreased primarily due to lower maintenance activity within the USPS vehicle fleet program driven by USPS' transition to a new FMIS. Commercial customer revenue growth was driven by our commercial fleet and e-commerce fulfillment business.
Costs and Operating Expenses.
 Costs and operating expenses decreased $8.4 million, or 3%, primarily due to decreased revenues. In addition, costs and operating expenses for this segment included expense for amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions and allocated corporate costs. Expense for amortization of intangible assets decreased $2.5 million in 2024 to $0.1 million from $2.6 million in 2023 driven by substantially all intangibles becoming fully amortized during the prior year. Expense for allocated corporate costs was $7.2 million for 2024 as compared to $7.8 million for 2023. 
Operating Income.
 Operating income decreased $14.2 million, or 46%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a shift in sales mix, the result of decreased revenues from our USPS vehicle fleet program, partially offset by decreased amortization expense and allocated corporate costs.
Financial Condition
There has been no material adverse change in our financial condition in 2024. Our outstanding borrowings under our term loan and revolving facility decreased $0.5 million, and we had $194 million of unused commitments under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2024. In May and October 2024, we completed underwritten public offerings of the Company's common stock, generating proceeds, net of issuance costs, of $162.0 million and $163.8 million, respectively. Changes to other asset and liability accounts were primarily due to our earnings; our level of business activity; the timing and level of inventory purchases to support new distribution programs, and vendor payments required to perform our work; and collections from our customers.

Table of Contents
Cash provided by financing activities increased $50.8 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase of $196.0 million in proceeds related to our public underwritten offerings of our common stock in the current period as compared to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in net borrowings of our debt during the current period of $144.9 million.
We paid cash dividends totaling approximately $7.1 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2024. Pursuant to our credit agreement, our payment of cash dividends is subject to annual restrictions. We have paid cash dividends each year since 1973.
Liquidity 
Our internal sources of liquidity are primarily from operating activities, specifically from changes in our level of revenues and associated inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, and from profitability. Significant increases or decreases in these operating activities can affect our liquidity. Our inventory and accounts payable levels can be affected by the timing of large opportunistic inventory purchases and by distributor agreement requirements. Our accounts receivable and accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of work we perform and by the timing of large purchases. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures; investments in expansion; improvement and maintenance of our operational and administrative facilities; and investments in the acquisition of businesses.
Our primary source of external financing is our credit agreement. Our credit agreement is with a bank group and includes a term loan and revolving facility, with an aggregate maximum borrowing capacity under our revolving facility of $350.0 million. Under the credit agreement we may elect to increase the maximum availability of the term loan, the revolving facility, or a combination of both, subject to customary lender commitment approvals. The aggregate limit of increases is $25.0 million. 
We believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, along with our cash flows from operations and debt instruments under our credit agreement mentioned above, will provide sufficient liquidity for our business operations as well as capital expenditures, dividends, and other capital requirements associated with our business operations over the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Other Obligations and Commitments
See Note (7) "Debt" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our long-term debt obligations. We estimate cash requirements for interest payments on our debt facilities to be approximately $30.1 million for 2025 and $24.2 million for 2026. The estimates do not take into account future draw downs and repayments on the debt or changes in the variable interest rate, and actual interest may be different. The estimates included variable rate interest obligations estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2024. The interest payments are estimated through the maturity date of our term loan. Interest payments under our revolving facility have been excluded because a reasonable estimate of timing and amount of cash out flows cannot be determined.
See Note (12) "Leases" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to future minimum lease payments relating to our operating lease obligations.
Inflation and Pricing
Our Aviation and Fleet segments have experienced broad-based inflationary impacts consistent with overall trends in the aerospace and industrial distribution market, due primarily to increased materials, labor, and services costs. The effect of these increased costs on total company net income has been mitigated with improved efficiency in our underlying business through productivity improvements and pass-through price increases. Given broader inflation in the economy, we are monitoring the risk inflation presents to active and future contracts. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), which require us to make estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant accounts, particularly those that involve judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management. Due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. We consider our policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition 
We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation. At the inception of each contract with a customer, we determine our performance obligations under the contract and the contract's transaction price. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer goods or services. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time based on transfer of control of products and services to our customers.
Our Aviation segment revenues result from the sale of aircraft parts and the performance of MRO services. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for the sale of aircraft parts at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when the parts are shipped. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for MRO services over time as the services are transferred to the customer. MRO services revenue recognition is measured based on the cost-to-cost input method, as costs incurred reflect the work completed, and therefore, the services transferred to date. Sales returns and allowances are not significant.
Substantially all Fleet segment revenues from the sale of vehicle parts to customers are recognized at the point in time of the transfer of control to the customer. Sales returns and allowances for vehicle parts are not significant.
We have applied the practical expedient for our parts sales and MRO services to exclude the amount of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected term of one year or less.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventories for our Aviation segment consist primarily of aftermarket parts for distribution, and general aviation engine accessories and parts, and also include related purchasing, overhaul labor, storage and handling costs. Inventories for our Fleet segment consist primarily of vehicle replacement parts, and also include related purchasing, storage and handling costs. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventory, considering factors such as its physical condition, sales patterns and demand in order to estimate the amount necessary to write down any slow moving, obsolete or damaged inventory. These estimates could vary significantly from actual amounts based on future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write-downs were made. 
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of each business acquired is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on information regarding their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and market multiples, among other items. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair values becomes available. We will recognize any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date (the "measurement period") in which the adjustments are determined. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.

Table of Contents
Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. We evaluate goodwill for our reporting units for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may initially qualitatively assess whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which is only required if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we considered the totality of all relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3C. In the event we deem a quantitative impairment test necessary, we estimate and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and market approach. The analysis relies on significant judgements and assumptions about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates, expected long-term growth rates, and financial measures derived from observable market data of comparable public companies. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2024, our qualitative impairment test determined that it was more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The carrying value of net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in Note (1) "Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included below in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
Interest Rates
Our credit agreement provides available borrowing at variable interest rates. Our interest expense is impacted by the overall global economic and interest rate environment. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. To mitigate the risks associated with future interest rate movements we have employed interest rate hedges to fix the rate on a portion of our outstanding borrowings for various periods. 
A hypothetical 1% increase to interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $4.6 million and would have decreased our net income and operating cash flows by a comparable amount.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
VSE Corporation
Opinion on the financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VSE Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15.2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Assessment of the write-down of slow moving inventory at certain locations within the Aviation segment
As described further in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records inventory within its Aviation Segment at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventory which requires the write-down of slow-moving inventory for excess or obsolescence based on certain inputs and assumptions used to determine the net realizable value. These assumptions include the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation of the inventory for the Aviation Segment.
The principal considerations for our determination that the assessment of the write-down of slow moving inventory at certain locations within the Aviation Segment are the magnitude of the inventory balance and that the inputs and assumptions used in determining the write-down are subject to significant management judgement. The inputs and assumptions used in determining the write-down of slow-moving inventory includes the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory, the identification of specific inventories associated with aircraft with declining usage trends and the impact of exclusive distribution agreements. The assessment of these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgement in evaluating the recovery rates for slow moving inventory.
-28-
Table of Contents
Our audit procedures related to the write-down of slow moving inventories at certain locations, within the Aviation Segment, included the following, among others.
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s inventory process, including controls over the Company’s evaluation of the impact on the estimate of net realizable value based on the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, sales of the inventory, specific inventories identified to relate to aircraft with declining usage and the approval and evaluation of distribution agreements.
•
We assessed the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory.
•
We assessed the identification of specific inventory with declining usage trends by evaluating external industry information.
•
We conducted sensitivity analysis around the reserve assumptions applied to aged inventory.

VSE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(1)  
Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business
VSE is a diversified aftermarket products and services company serving commercial and government markets. Our operations include aircraft and airframe parts supply and distribution, supply chain and inventory management services; MRO services of aircraft components and engine accessories; vehicle fleet sustainment programs; and vehicle fleet parts supply and distribution. We operate in 
two
 reportable segments aligned with our operating segments: Aviation and Fleet. 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows our parent company and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
In February 2024, we entered into 
two
 separate agreements to sell substantially all of the Federal and Defense segment assets. See Note (3) "Discontinued Operations" for further information. The consolidated financial statements reflect the Federal and Defense segment's results of operations as discontinued operations, and the related assets and liabilities as held-for-sale for all periods presented. 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to reflect discontinued operations presentation. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relate solely to continuing operations and exclude all discontinued operations.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates affecting the financial statements may include, but are not limited to, fair value measurements, inventory provisions, collectability of receivables, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets and contingencies.
Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based awards as compensation to employees and directors. Stock-based awards include stock-settled bonus awards, time-vested stock awards and performance share awards. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the underlying award’s requisite service period, as measured using the award’s grant date fair value. Our policy is to recognize forfeitures as they occur. For performance share awards, we assess the probability of achieving the performance conditions at each reporting period end and adjust compensation expense based on the number of shares we expect to ultimately issue.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Shares issued during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of outstanding stock-based awards. The antidilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the diluted per share calculation are not material.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity of these instruments, the carrying values on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. Although certain cash balances exceed insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, we do not limit our credit exposure to any one financial institution and utilize financial institutions with high credit quality.
As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $
5.9
 million of cash in foreign bank accounts, primarily in connection with our acquisitions of Desser Holding Company, LLC ("Desser Aerospace") and Kellstrom Aerospace. Refer to Note (2) "Acquisitions," for details regarding our acquisitions.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. Property and equipment is generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: computer equipment, furniture, other equipment from 
three
 to 
15
 years; and buildings and land improvements from 
15
 to 
20
 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided by the straight-line method over the lesser of their useful life or the remaining term of the lease.

Leases
We determine at inception whether an arrangement that provides us control over the use of an asset is a lease. Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases for facilities with fixed payment terms. We recognize a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability upon commencement of our operating leases. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate, on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease liability plus any initial indirect costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives. 
We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, except for variable lease payments that are expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.  
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less with purchase options or extension options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised are not recorded on the balance sheet. Operating lease cost is included in costs and operating expenses on our consolidated statement of income.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of our trade receivables. Our trade receivables consist of amounts due from various commercial entities and government clients. We believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions. The credit risk, with respect to contracts with the government, is limited due to the creditworthiness of the respective governmental entity. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and monitoring of the financial condition of all our customers. We maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers.
Revenue Recognition
We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation. At the inception of each contract with a customer, we determine our performance obligations under the contract and the contract's 
-36-
Table of Contents
transaction price. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the respective goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time based on transfer of control of products and services to our customers.
Substantially all our Fleet segment revenues from the sale of vehicle parts to customers are recognized at the point in time of the transfer of control to the customer. Sales returns and allowances for vehicle parts are not significant.
Our Aviation segment revenues result from the sale of aircraft parts and performance of MRO services for private and commercial aircraft owners, other aviation MRO providers, and aviation original equipment manufacturers. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for the sale of aircraft parts at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when the parts are shipped. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for MRO services over time as the services are transferred to the customer. MRO services revenue recognized is measured based on the cost-to-cost input method, as costs incurred reflect the work completed, and therefore the services transferred to date. Sales returns and allowances are not significant.
Receivables and Contract Balances 
Receivables are recorded at amounts earned less an allowance. We review our receivables regularly to determine if there are any potentially uncollectible accounts. 
Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized, and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The amounts may not exceed their estimated net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle. Contract liabilities include customer advances and billings in excess of revenue recognized and are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We establish allowances for credit losses on our accounts receivable and contract assets. To measure expected credit losses, we have disaggregated pools of receivable balances by segment. Within each segment, receivables exhibit similar risk characteristics. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past due status. We also consider current market conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions to inform potential adjustments to historical loss data. In addition, we also record allowances for credit losses for specific receivables that are deemed to have a higher risk profile than the rest of the respective pool of receivables, such as concerns about a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligation to us. The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the FIFO method. Inventories consist primarily of finished goods replacement parts for our Fleet and Aviation segments, and also include related purchasing, storage, and handling costs. Inventories for our Aviation segment consist primarily of aftermarket parts for distribution, and general aviation engine accessories and parts, and also include related purchasing, overhaul labor, storage, and handling costs. 
We periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventory, considering factors such as its physical condition, sales patterns and demand in order to estimate the amount necessary to write down any slow moving, obsolete or damaged inventory. These estimates could vary significantly from actual amounts based upon future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write-downs were made.

Deferred Compensation Plans
We provide for certain key management employees to be incentivized and rewarded based on overall company performance through the VSE Corporation Deferred Supplemental Compensation Plan (the "DSC Plan"). We recognized DSC Plan expenses of $
0.3
 million, $
0.4
 million, and $
0.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
-37-
Table of Contents
We invest in corporate owned life insurance ("COLI") products and in mutual funds that are held in a Rabbi Trust to fund the DSC Plan obligations. The COLI investments are recorded at cash surrender value and the mutual fund investments are recorded at fair value. The DSC Plan assets are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our DSC Plan assets were $
12.0
 million and $
11.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Gains and losses recognized on the changes in fair value of the investments are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
 We recorded net gains of $
0.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $
22
 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Derivative Instruments
Derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The carrying value of net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired entities to the underlying tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning as of their effective acquisition dates. For contingent consideration arrangements, a liability is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in operations.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for potential impairment at the reporting unit level annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
When testing goodwill for impairment, we may initially qualitatively assess whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which is only required if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we considered the totality of all relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3C. In the event we deem a quantitative impairment test necessary, we estimate and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach, which involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including projected future operating results and cash flows, the cost of capital, and financial measures derived from observable market data of comparable public companies. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the amount of impairment expense is equal to the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and the reporting unit’s carrying value.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. When the carrying 
-38-
Table of Contents
amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows.

Acquisitions 
Fiscal 2024
Turbine Controls, Inc.
On April 24, 2024, we completed the acquisition of TCI for a total consideration of $
122.4
 million, consisting of net cash consideration of $
112.4
 million, which included $
1.5
 million as a net working capital adjustment, and in-kind payment in the form of shares of the Company's common stock with a value equal to approximately $
10.0
 million. The purchase price of this acquisition was funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. TCI is a leading provider of aftermarket MRO support services for complex engine components, as well as engine and airframe accessories, across commercial and military applications. The acquisition presents an opportunity for VSE's Aviation segment to accelerate its MRO strategy, including expanding our repair capability offerings and adding several new OEM relationships.
The purchase price for TCI was allocated on a preliminary basis, among assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value based on the best available information on the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The fair values of the non-financial assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, were determined based on preliminary estimates, assumptions, and other information compiled by management, including independent valuations utilizing established industry valuation techniques. We have not yet finalized the determination of the fair values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, income taxes. Therefore, the allocation of the total consideration for the acquisition to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, is preliminary until we obtain final information regarding their fair values, which could potentially result in changes to the TCI opening balance sheet.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we adjusted the purchase price allocation as a result of working capital and measurement period adjustments. The adjustments were recorded as a result of new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and resulted in immaterial impacts to accrued expense and other current liabilities, goodwill, and cash consideration, net of cash acquired.

(a) Amounts were classified as current for the prior period consolidated balance sheet.
Certain assets and liabilities previously reported as held-for-sale were excluded from the FDS sale and were reclassified in 2024 as held and used, at their respective fair values, on the consolidated balance sheets. The reclassification related to our Alexandria, VA headquarters office space and consisted of an operating lease right-of-use-asset of $
7.1
 million, property and equipment of $
2.6
 million, and an operating lease obligation of $
11.0
 million. In 2024, we vacated the headquarters office space, resulting in a write down of the associated lease right-of-use asset and property and equipment, and then subsequently terminated the lease for the vacated headquarters office space. See Note (12) "Leases" for further information.
The FDS Sale resulted in the divestiture of certain government contracts requiring novation. Until the novation process is finalized, we continue to receive cash collections related to these contracts, which are due to the purchaser. As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded a $
0.3
 million liability for these collections within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

We have a credit agreement with a bank group from which we borrow amounts under the agreement to provide working capital support, fund letters of credit, and finance acquisitions. The credit agreement includes term and revolving facilities. The revolving facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit. Borrowings under our term loan and revolving facility mature in October 2026.
The maximum amount of credit available under the credit agreement for revolving loans and letters of credit is $
350
 million. We may elect to increase the maximum availability of the term loan facility, the revolving facility, or both facilities up to an aggregate additional amount of $
25
 million subject to lender approvals. The credit agreement also provides for letters of credit aggregating up to $
25
 million. 
Borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate of interest based on Term SOFR or a base rate, plus in each case an applicable margin (based on our Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio). The base rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 
.50
%; (ii) the Prime Rate and (iii) the sum of Term SOFR for a one-month interest period, plus the difference between the additional Term SOFR interest margin for SOFR rate loans and the additional base rate interest margin for base rate loans. The applicable margins for SOFR loans ranges from 
1.50
% to 
3.75
% and 
.50
% to 
2.75
% for base rate loans. We also pay a commitment fee with respect to undrawn amounts under the revolving loan facility ranging from 
.25
% to 
.50
% (based on our Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio) and fees on letters of credit that are issued. 
As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on our outstanding term loan and weighted average interest rate on our aggregate outstanding revolving facility was 
7.40
% and 
7.21
%, respectively. We had letters of credit outstanding of $
0.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we reclassified $
4.3
 million and $
3.8
 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense, net. We estimate that we will reclassify $

Stock-Based Compensation Plans    
The VSE Corporation 2006 Restricted Stock Plan, as amended (the "2006 Plan"), provides VSE's employees and directors the opportunity to receive various types of stock-based compensation and cash awards. The total number of shares authorized for issuance under this plan was 
1,875,000
 and, as of December 31, 2024, 
448,083
 shares remained available for issuance. As of December 31, 2024, we have outstanding stock-settled bonus awards, time-vested stock awards, and performance share awards under this plan.
Stock-settled bonus awards are a fixed dollar-denominated award. On the first anniversary of the grant date, the total fixed dollar value of the award is converted into shares based on our closing stock price on the date of conversion. Vesting occurs over a 
three-year
 service period in 
three
 equal tranches. Beginning with the 2023 stock-settled bonus awards, the first vesting occurs 
one year
 after the award is converted into shares. For awards granted prior to 2023, the first vesting occurs 
one year
 after the grant date. On each vesting date, 
100
% of the vested award is paid in stock. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche, which results in an accelerated pattern for an award.
Time-vested stock awards generally vest over a 
three-year
 service period in equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. Our directors receive a grant of stock annually as part of their compensation and the stock vests immediately upon grant.
We grant performance share awards to certain employees under the 2006 Plan. Performance share awards are rights to receive shares of our stock on the satisfaction of service requirements and performance conditions. These awards vest ratably in equal 
-50-
Table of Contents
installments over a 
three-year
 period on the anniversary of each grant date, subject to meeting the minimum service requirements and the achievement of certain annual or cumulative financial metrics of our performance, with the number of shares ultimately issued, if any, ranging up to 
200
% of the specified target shares beginning in 2023. If performance is below the minimum threshold level of performance, no shares will be issued. For all performance share awards granted, the annual and cumulative financial metrics are based on our achievement of adjusted EBITDA.
During fiscal 2021, we established the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") to allow eligible employees to purchase shares of our VSE common stock at a discount of up to 
15
% of the fair market value on specified dates. For ESPP offerings in the year ended December 31, 2024, the purchase price was 
12
% off the lesser of the fair market value on the date of the offering and the fair market value on the date of purchase, thereby resulting in stock compensation expense of $
0.1
 million. As of December 31, 2024, 
500,000
 shares of VSE common stock are authorized for issuance under the ESPP.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the US has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws in 2023. Considering that we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, we do not expect these rules will significantly increase our global tax costs. We will continue to monitor US and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for future potential impacts.

Lease Abandonment and Termination
In connection with the FDS sale as described in Note (3) "Discontinued Operations", we implemented changes that resulted in one-time charges primarily related to the lease abandonment and termination of our headquarters office space.
On June 28, 2024, we ceased use of our 
95,000
 sq. ft. leased office space in Alexandria, VA. We relocated our VA-based corporate staff to a 
4,000
 sq. ft. office space in Vienna, VA under a new short-term lease. We recognized one-time lease abandonment costs of $
12.9
 million, which comprised of a reduction in our operating lease right-of-use assets of $
6.7
 million, exit costs of $
3.7
 million, and a non-cash write-off of certain property and equipment of $
2.5
 million. These one-time costs are included within lease abandonment and termination costs on our consolidated statements of income.

Table of Contents
On September 4, 2024, we entered into an agreement to immediately terminate the Alexandria, VA, office space lease in exchange for $
12.0
 million, payable in 
two
 equal installments due in January 2025 and January 2026. As a result, we recognized a lease termination gain of $
0.7
 million, which comprised of a $
1.1
 million net liability reduction, partially offset by a $
0.4
 million decrease in our remaining operating lease right-of-use asset. The lease termination gain is included within lease abandonment and termination costs on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024, $
6.0
 million of the $
12.0
 million due as a result of the lease termination is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities, while the remaining $
6.0
 million is classified within other long-term liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies
We may have certain claims in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings, against us and against other parties. In our opinion, the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, because the results of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.
Further, from time-to-time, government agencies audit or investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable contractual and regulatory requirements. Government audits or investigations, whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties imposed, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes, audits and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

Business Segments and Customer Information
Segment Information
The sale of the Federal and Defense segment allows us to focus on a long-term strategic growth strategy focused on higher margin and higher growth aftermarket parts distribution and MRO businesses. Following the sale of the Federal and Defense segment, management of our business operations is conducted under 
two
 reportable operating segments:
Aviation: 
Our Aviation segment provides aftermarket MRO and distribution services to commercial, business and general aviation, cargo, military and defense, and rotorcraft customers globally. Core services include parts distribution, MRO services including fuel controls, avionics, pneumatics, hydraulics, wheel and brake, and rotable exchange and supply chain services.
Fleet: 
Our Fleet segment provides parts, inventory management, e-commerce fulfillment, logistics, supply chain support and other services to support the commercial aftermarket medium- and heavy-duty truck market, and the USPS. Core services include vehicle parts distribution, sourcing, IT solutions, customized fleet logistics, warehousing, kitting, just-in-time supply chain management, alternative product sourcing, and engineering and technical support.
The operating segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM evaluates segment performance based on consolidated revenues and operating income and considers budget-to-actual, sequential period and prior period variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. Segment costs, depreciation and amortization, and allocated corporate costs are viewed as significant segment expenses as part of the CODM’s evaluation.
Net sales of our business segments exclude inter-segment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
 Corporate expenses are primarily selling, general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments. Corporate assets are primarily cash, property and equipment and investments held in separate trust.

Customer Information
Our revenues are derived from the delivery of products and services performed for commercial and government customers. Revenues from the USPS, reported within our Fleet segment, represented 
11
%, 
19
%, and 
23
% of consolidated revenues for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Our customers also include various other commercial entities and government agencies. See Note (4) "Revenue Recognition" for revenue by customer.
We do not measure revenue or profit by product or service lines, either for internal management or external financial reporting purposes, because it would be impractical to do so. Products offered and services performed are determined by contract requirements and the types of products and services provided for one contract bear no relation to similar products and services provided on another contract. Products and services provided vary when new contracts begin, or current contracts expire. In many cases, more than one product or service is provided under a contract. Accordingly, cost and revenue tracking are designed to best serve contract requirements and segregating costs and revenues by product or service lines in situations for which it is not required would be difficult and costly to both us and our customers.

Capital Stock
Our common stock has a par value of $

0.05
 per share are credited to additional paid in capital. Holders of common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per common share held on all matters voted on by our stockholders. Stockholders of record are entitled to the amount of dividends declared per common share held.
In May 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with certain underwriters relating to the issuance and sale of up to 
2,429,577
 shares of the Company's common stock at a public offering price of $
71.00
 per share. On May 17, 2024, the Company issued 
2,429,577
 shares, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, pursuant to the underwriting agreement. Net proceeds of $
162.0
 million were received by the Company, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, including amounts borrowed to pay the purchase price of the acquisition of TCI and for general corporate purposes. We incurred legal and accounting fees of $
0.4
 million associated with the May 2024 public offering.
In October 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with certain underwriters relating to the issuance and sale of 
1,724,137
 shares of the Company's common stock at a public offering price of $
87.00
 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 
30
 days, to purchase up to an additional 
258,620
 shares of common stock. The offering closed on October 17, 2024, resulting in the issuance of 
1,982,757
 shares, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, pursuant to the underwriting agreement, for which we received net proceeds of $
163.8
 million, net of issuance costs. Additionally, we incurred legal and accounting fees of $
0.3
 million associated with the October 2024 public offering. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Kellstrom Aerospace acquisition and general corporate purposes, including repaying outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility.

401(k) Plan 
We maintain a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that covers substantially all our employees. Under the provisions of our 401(k) plan, employees' eligible contributions are matched at rates specified in the plan documents. Our expense associated with this plan was approximately $
2.0
 million, $
1.6
 million, and $
1.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
(17)  
Fair Value Measurements
We utilize fair value measurement guidance prescribed by GAAP to value our financial instruments. The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1); inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions (Level 3).
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and amounts included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities that meet the definition of a financial instrument approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturity. The carrying value of our outstanding debt obligations approximates its fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is calculated using Level 2 inputs based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to our existing debt arrangements.
-58-
Table of Contents
Non-financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were measured at fair value using income, market and cost valuation methodologies. See Note (2), "Acquisitions." The fair value measurements were estimated using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement.
The following table summarizes the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level they fall within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

Restructuring Costs
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $
4.2
 million of corporate 
restructuring expenses
, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to the cancellation of contracts and leasing agreements associated with the FDS Sale. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
0.8
 million of these costs are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our corporate restructuring activities related to the FDS Sale are substantially complete, and we do not expect to incur additional material costs associated with these activities
.
(19)  
Subsequent Event
On February 17, 2025, we signed a definitive agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of our Fleet segment for a total consideration of up to $
230
 million (the “Fleet Sale”). This consideration assumes a $
140
 million cash payment at the closing of the Fleet Sale, a $
25
 million seller note, and an earn-out payment of up to $
65
 million, subject to the achievement of certain milestones. The Fleet Sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the Fleet Sale to reduce existing borrowings under the credit agreement.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
As permitted by the SEC rules, management's assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, excludes an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of TCI and Kellstrom Aerospace, acquired on April 24, 2024 and December 3, 2024, respectively. TCI and Kellstrom Aerospace represent total assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisitions, and revenues constituting 15% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited our consolidated financial statements included in this report and our internal control over financial reporting, and the firm's report on our internal control over financial reporting are set forth below.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Change in Internal Controls
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), that have materially affected these controls or are reasonably likely to materially affect these controls after the evaluation of these controls.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
VSE Corporation
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of VSE Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Turbine Controls, Inc. ("TCI") and Kellstrom Aerospace Group, Inc. ("Kellstrom Aerospace"), both wholly-owned subsidiaries, whose combined financial statements reflect total assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition, and revenues constituting 15 and 9 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. As indicated in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, TCI and Kellstrom Aerospace were both acquired during 2024. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of TCI and Kellstrom Aerospace.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
