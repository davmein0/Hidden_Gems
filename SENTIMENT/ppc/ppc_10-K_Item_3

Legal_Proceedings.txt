PART II
Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “PPC.”
Holders
As of February 7, 2025, the Company estimates that there were approximately 85,000 holders (including individual participants in security position listings) of the Company’s common stock.
Dividends
The Company does not have a policy of paying dividends to its stockholders. Any change in dividend policy will depend upon future conditions, including earnings and financial condition, general business conditions, any applicable contractual limitations and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors in its discretion. 
Both the U.S. Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Company’s senior notes restrict, but do not prohibit, the Company from declaring dividends. In addition, the terms of the Europe Revolver Facility Agreement restrict the Europe’s ability and the ability of certain of Europe’s subsidiaries to, among other things, make payments and distributions to us, which could in turn impair our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. See “Note 13. Debt” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information.
Performance Graph
The graph below shows a comparison from December 29, 2019 through December 29, 2024 of the cumulative 5-year total stockholder return of holders of the Company’s common stock with the cumulative total returns of the Russell 2000 index and a customized peer group of two companies: Tyson Foods Inc and Hormel Foods Corp. The graph assumes that the value of the investment in our common stock, in each index, and in the peer group (including reinvestment of dividends) was $100 on December 29, 2019 and tracks it through December 29, 2024.
The graph covers the period from December 29, 2019 to December 29, 2024, and reflects the performance of the Company’s single class of common stock. The stock price performance represented by this graph is not necessarily indicative

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Summary
Overview
We are one of the largest protein companies in the world, and as a vertically integrated company, we are able to control nearly every phase of the production process, which helps us manage food safety and quality, control margins and improve customer service. This gives us the opportunity to continue to create growth and development opportunities, further increasing our position as a leading domestic and global protein company.
We reported net income attributable to Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation of $1.1 billion, or $4.57 per diluted common share, and profit before tax totaling $1.4 billion, for 2024. These operating results included gross profit of $2.3 billion and generated $2.0 billion of cash from operations. We generated consolidated operating margins of 8.4% with operating margins of 10.5%, 3.3%, and 10.6% in our U.S., Europe, and Mexico reportable segments, respectively. During 2024, we generated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included later in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report.
We operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal year 2024 was a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2023 was a 53-week fiscal year.
Global Economic Conditions
During 2024, global inflation levels declined, but remained above historical averages. The U.K. and E.U. region saw a continued decrease in inflation rate and flat demand, leading to cost recovery for our business and stabilizing prices for customers, though labor costs continue to be a challenge for our Europe operations. We have and will continue to invest in our people and implement supply chain solutions to mitigate global economic impacts in our Europe operations. The Russia-Ukraine war's impact on the global feed ingredient and energy markets is currently less pronounced though there remain many risks and uncertainties that may impact global markets. In Mexico, inflation remains high and the peso weakened further against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2024. Mexico remains a relatively volatile market given overall business seasonality.
We have responded to these challenges by continuing negotiations with customers to mitigate the impact of extraordinary costs we have experienced. We also continue to focus on operational initiatives that aim to deliver labor efficiencies, better agricultural performance and improved yields.
Raw Materials and Input Costs
Our U.S. and Mexico segments use corn and soybean meal as the main ingredients for feed production, while our Europe segment uses wheat, soybean meal and barley as the main ingredients for feed production.
During 2024, the global price of corn, measured at U.S. dollars per metric ton, maintained lower prices at an average of about 30% below prior year prices, per the International Monetary Fund as reported by the St. Louis Fed research center. Towards the end of 2024, corn prices ticked upwards and ended the year about 4% lower than the prior year. Global wheat prices at the end of 2024 were about 14% lower than the prior year ending prices. Good growing conditions and lower demand led to the decrease in corn prices, while wheat prices fluctuated more throughout 2024. Soybean prices were lower than 2023 due to better growing conditions and lower demand.

We obtain corn and soybean meal prices from the Chicago Board of Trade, and we obtain wheat prices from the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.
During 2024, U.S. commodity market prices for chicken products trended in line with historical averages to begin the year, but saw stronger seasonal increases in mid-first quarter as industry production declined relative to the prior year levels and domestic demand growth absorbed produced volumes and eroded cold storage inventories. Supply rebounded with growth in the second quarter, however, hatchability and broiler mortality headwinds inhibited more substantial production increases. Although broiler production grew, robust retail and foodservice demand growth absorbed production at a rate sufficient to maintain market prices above the five-year historical average throughout the remainder of 2024.
U.S. commodity market prices throughout 2025 will be impacted by the evolution of foodservice, retail, and export meat demand, influenced by factors such as government regulation, spread of Avian influenza cases both domestically and abroad, evolution of the general economy, and overall protein supply.
During 2024, the U.K. chicken market saw an increase in labor costs due to the national living wages change in April 2024. Through customer contracts and additional negotiations, we have offset the majority of these cost increases. Due to increased competition with the U.K. egg market, there has been an increase in costs to retain growers, while feed costs have decreased throughout the year. We continue to focus on managing costs, including labor and yield efficiencies, agricultural performance and increasing operational efficiencies through investments in capital projects.
Commodity prices for chicken in Mexico ended 2024 above prior-year prices despite incremental decreases throughout the second half of the year. Mexico grain prices decreased from prior year levels.
U.K. market prices for pork products have followed an upward trend from 2022, albeit at a slower rate throughout 2024. During the year, the U.K. market price for a pig has fallen slowly in line with a general reduction in input prices as well as market pressure from Europe. U.K. pig farming became profitable in the second quarter of 2023 and has remained profitable since.
U.K. prices for prepared foods have increased from inflationary pressures. We continue to focus on partnering with our Key Customers and increasing operational efficiency.
Sustainability
We believe sustainability involves continuously improving social responsibility, economic viability and environmental stewardship. We are committed to helping society meet the global challenge of feeding a growing population in a responsible matter.
Environmental Stewardship
. We are focused on improving the efficiency of our operations and supporting producers to reduce our environmental footprint. In support of this initiative in April 2021, we issued $1.0 billion of sustainability-linked bonds, which require us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 global greenhouse gas emissions intensity of 17.7% by 2025 and by 30.0% by 2030 from our 2019 baseline.
Social Responsibility
. Safety of our team members is a condition at Pilgrim’s. The physical health and mental well-being of our workforce continues to be a top priority for our business. As such, we implemented hundreds of safety measures within our facilities and constantly evolve our operations as needed. To support the communities where our team members live and work, we have committed $20 million in funding for local projects focused on alleviating food insecurity and strengthening

long-term community infrastructure through our Hometown Strong initiative. To date, we have approved over $15 million for these areas. We also continue to build on Hometown Strong through our Better Futures program, which provides team member and their dependents in tuition free, higher education program, to improve their skills and career opportunities.

The program has been exceptionally well received as we have over 2,100 participants since inception. Finally, ensuring the well-being of animals under our care is an uncompromising commitment at Pilgrim’s. We continually strive to improve our welfare efforts through the use of new technologies and the implementation of standards that meet and exceed regulatory requirements and industry guidelines.
Governance. 
To cultivate discipline and drive accountability for Sustainability-related matters, we use our annual budgeting process to establish strategies, plans, and risk mitigation tactics. This process is further reinforced by a series of key performance indicators to evaluate and monitor progress. These performance indicators are linked with compensation for both senior executive and plant level personnel. As part of our business management processes, progress against these metrics is reviewed at least monthly and evaluated by external agencies to assess progress against industry peers. In addition, the Board of Directors formed a Sustainability Committee to provide oversight and counsel on strategies, policies, and investments to reduce the impact of climate change. The Sustainability Committee meets on a quarterly basis to monitor progress, provide feedback, and evaluate impact of trends. 
Reportable Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: the U.S., Europe, and Mexico. We measure segment profit as operating income. Certain corporate expenses are allocated to the Mexico and Europe reportable segments based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the U.S. For additional information, see “Note 20. Reportable Segments” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

U.S. Reportable Segment. 
U.S. net sales generated in 2024 increased $602.2 million, or 6.0%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2023 primarily because of an increase in net sales per pound, contributing $739.0 million, or 7.4 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. This increase in net sales per pound was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of $136.8 million, or 1.4 percentage points, due to one less week in 2024. The increase in net sales per pound was primarily driven by higher commodity market pricing for fresh chicken products as compared to prior year across all major cuts.
Europe Reportable Segment. 
Europe sales generated in 2024 decreased $66.6 million, or 1.3%, from sales generated in 2023 primarily from a decrease in net sales per pound due to the pass-through of lower input costs and a decrease in sales volume of $163.0 million, or 3.1 percentage points, and $48.4 million, or 0.9 percentage points, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $144.8 million, or 2.7 percentage points.
Mexico Reportable Segment. 
Mexico sales generated in 2024 decreased $19.5 million, or 0.9%, from sales generated in 2023 primarily because of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62.0 million, or 2.8 percentage points, partially offset by an increase in net sales per pound and an increase in sales volume of $39.3 million, or 1.8 percentage points, and $3.2 million, or 0.1 percentage points, respectively. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was due to a weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The increases in net sales per pound and sales volume were driven by

improved product mix and increased commodity chicken prices. Sales volumes increased across all sales channel, except live chicken which slightly decreased. 
Gross profit.
 Gross profit increased by $1.2 billion, or 106.8%, from $1.1 billion generated in 2023 to $2.3 billion generated in 2024. The following tables provide gross profit information:

U.S. Reportable Segment. 
Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2024 decreased $439.4 million, or 4.6%, from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2023. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to decreased cost per pound sold and sales volume of $309.8 million, or 3.3 percentage points, and $129.6 million, or 1.3 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in cost per pound sold was driven by a reduction in feed ingredients, such as corn and soy, costs in our live operations. The reduction in live operations costs was partially offset by an increase in labor, incentive compensation, and insurance costs.
Europe Reportable Segment. 
Cost of sales incurred by the Europe operations during 2024 decreased $153.5 million, or 3.2%, from cost of sales incurred by the Europe operations during 2023 primarily due to decreases in cost per pound sold and sales volume of $248.7 million, or 5.2 percentage points, and $44.9 million, or 0.9 percentage points, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $140.1 million, or 2.9 percentage points. The decrease in cost per pound was driven by decreased feed ingredients, labor, utilities and other operating costs and from production efficiencies as a result of our restructuring initiatives.
Mexico Reportable Segment. 
Cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2024 decreased $85.1 million, or 4.5%, from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2023 primarily because of the favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and a decrease in cost per pound sold of $53.6 million, or 2.8 percentage points, and $34.3 million, or 1.8 percentage points, respectively. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of $2.8 million, or 0.1 percentage points. The favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement was due to a weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in cost per pound sold was driven by a reduction in commodity ingredients costs, partially offset by an increase in employee profit sharing costs due to higher profitability in 2024.
Operating income.
 Operating income increased $983.8 million, or 188.4%, from $522.3 million generated for 2023 to $1,506.1 million generated for 2024. The following tables provide operating income information:

U.S. Reportable Segment.
 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2024 increased $167.5 million, or 59.1%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2023 primarily from increases in litigation settlement costs and incentive compensation costs.
Europe Reportable Segment. 
SG&A expense incurred by the Europe operations during 2024 decreased $3.6 million, or 1.8%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Europe operations during 2023 primarily due to decreased labor and employee-related costs.
Mexico Reportable Segment. 
SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2024 decreased $2.3 million, or 3.6%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2023. SG&A expense decreased primarily from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by increased wages and employee profit share costs.
Net interest expense
. Consolidated interest expense decreased 46.9% to $88.5 million in 2024 from $166.6 million in 2023. The decrease in net interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in interest income earned on higher cash balances, a decrease from early extinguishment of debt, and a decrease in interest expense on outstanding borrowings due to decreased borrowings. The decrease in net interest expense from early extinguishment of debt is due to gross realized gains of $13.8 million recognized on the repurchases of $164.3 million of outstanding principal senior notes during 2024 compared to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $20.7 million recognized on the repayment of senior notes during 2023. As a percent of net sales, net interest expense in 2024 and 2023 was 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively.
Income taxes.
 Our consolidated income tax expense in 2024 was $325.0 million, compared to income tax expense of $42.9 million in 2023. The increase in income tax expense in 2024 resulted primarily from an increase in pre-tax income during 2024.

Items necessary to reconcile from net income to cash flow provided by operating activities included net noncash expenses of $462.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net noncash expense items included $419.9 million of depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized as a component of interest expense of $20.7 million, loan cost amortization of $7.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $7.2 million, deferred income tax expense of $6.7 million, asset impairment of $4.0 million, and accretion of bond discount of $2.3 million. Partially offsetting the net noncash expenses was an $6.1 million gain on property disposals. Other items affecting net noncash expenses were individually immaterial.
Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
The change in trade accounts and other receivables, including accounts receivable from related parties, represented a $88.3 million source of cash in 2024. The change in cash was primarily due to the timing of customer payments and collections of insurance proceeds. The change in trade accounts and other receivables, including accounts receivable from related parties, represented a $19.0 million use of cash in 2023. The change in cash was primarily due to the timing of customer payments.
The change in inventories represented a $134.5 million source of cash in 2024. The change in cash resulted from a decrease in our finished goods inventories and lower input costs included in inventory values. The change in inventories represented a $12.6 million source of cash in 2023. The change in cash resulted from an decrease in our raw materials and work-in-process inventory values.
The change in

prepaid expenses and other current assets represented a $33.3 million use of cash in 2024. This change resulted primarily from a net increase in the commodity derivatives assets from favorable fair value positions, an increase from short-term available-for-sale investments, and the impact of foreign currency translation. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets represented a $17.8 million source of cash in 2023. This change resulted primarily from a net decrease in the commodity derivatives assets.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses, including accounts payable to related parties, represented a $126.7 million source of cash in 2024. This change resulted primarily from increases in litigation settlement and incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, including accounts payable to related parties, represented a $68.7 million use of cash in 2023. This change resulted primarily from the timing of payments.
The change in income taxes, which includes income taxes receivable, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, reserves for uncertain tax positions and the tax components within accumulated other comprehensive loss, represented a $109.4 million source of cash in 2024. This change resulted primarily from the timing of estimated tax payments and higher profitability in 2024 which increased our income tax payables and reduced income tax receivable. The change in income taxes, which includes income taxes receivables, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, reserves for uncertain tax positions and the tax components within accumulated other comprehensive loss, represented a $8.9 million use of cash in 2023. This change resulted primarily from the timing of estimated tax payments and lower profitability in 2023.

Payments on revolving line of credit, long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations during 2024 are primarily related to open market repurchases of outstanding senior notes. The proceeds from contribution of capital under the Tax Sharing Agreement with JBS USA Holdings during 2024 were an allocation made during tax year 2023 for payment of historical tax adjustments. Payments on early extinguishment of debt during 2024 are transaction fees related to the bond repurchases.
Proceeds from revolving line of credit, long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations during 2023 are primarily from the offerings of our 2033 and 2034 Senior Notes as well as borrowings on our U.S. and Europe Credit Facilities. Payments on revolving line of credit, long-term borrowings, and finance lease obligations during 2023 are primarily due to the paydown of our term loans and revolving notes on our 2021 U.S. Credit Facility, the completed tender offer of our 2027 Senior Notes, and repayment of borrowings on our Europe Credit Facility. The payment of capitalized loan costs during 2023 relates to the offerings of our 2033 and 2034 Senior Notes and the execution of our 2023 U.S. Credit Facility. The payment on early extinguishment of debt during 2023 primarily relates to the tender-offer payment of our 2027 Senior Notes. The distribution of equity under the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2023 is the 2022 distribution of equity that was paid in the first quarter of 2023.
Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements
Our long-term debt and other borrowing arrangements consist of senior notes, revolving credit facilities and other term loan agreements. For a description, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Note 13. Debt.”
Capital Expenditures
We anticipate spending between $450 million and $500 million on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment in 2025. Capital expenditures will primarily be incurred to grow our operations, improve efficiencies, to reduce costs, and for information technology system enhancement projects. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and cash on hand.
Contractual Obligations
In addition to our debt commitments at December 29, 2024, we had other commitments and contractual obligations that require us to make specified payments in the future.

Pillar II Tax Initiative
Global Minimum Tax
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) is an international organization composed of 38 member countries that work together to establish international standards and develop solutions for various social, economic, and environmental challenges. These solutions range from improving economic performance and job creation to promoting quality education and combating international tax evasion.
Regarding the fight against tax evasion, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project was launched in 2013 as a collaboration between the G20 (a group of the world's 20 largest economies) and the OECD. The project aims to implement 15 measures to combat tax avoidance, enhance the consistency of international tax rules, and ensure a more transparent global tax environment. It seeks to prevent the misuse of tax regulations that result in the erosion of the tax base, particularly through profit shifting to jurisdictions with more favorable or no taxation.
Pillar II is part of one of the OECD’s most recent initiatives, known as BEPS 2.0, which aims to address tax challenges arising from evolving business models in a globalized economy. The goal of Pillar II is to establish a global minimum tax system for multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) with annual consolidated revenue exceeding €750 million. This additional taxation seeks to balance the global allocation of corporate income taxes and ensure that multinational groups pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% per jurisdiction where they operate.
Starting in the 2024 calendar year, the Pillar II rules came into effect in several jurisdictions, impacting multinational companies operating in these markets. However, during the first three years of implementation, transitional rules (Safe Harbor) have been introduced to simplify the calculation of the effective tax rate per jurisdiction, facilitating the adaptation of multinational groups to the new requirements.
As the Group operates in multiple countries that have adopted the global minimum tax as of 2024—including France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and the U.K.—the Company has been closely monitoring the potential impacts of these new regulations and, to date, does not anticipate significant material exposure to this tax.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Note 1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
General
. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets, litigation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.
 The vast majority of our revenue is derived from contracts which are based upon a customer ordering our products. While there may be master agreements, the contract is only established when the customer’s order is accepted by us. We account for a contract, which may be verbal or written, when it is approved and committed by both parties, 
31
Table of Contents

the rights of the parties are identified along with payment terms, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable.
We evaluate the transaction for distinct performance obligations, which are the sale of our products to customers. Since our products are commodity market-priced, the sales price is representative of the observable, standalone selling price. Each performance obligation is recognized based upon a pattern of recognition that reflects the transfer of control to the customer at a point in time, which is upon destination (customer location or port of destination) and depicts the transfer of control and recognition of revenue. There are instances of customer pick-up at our facilities, in which case control transfers to the customer at that point and we recognize revenue. Our performance obligations are typically fulfilled within days to weeks of the acceptance of the order.
We make judgments regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from revenue and cash flows with customers. Determination of a contract requires evaluation and judgment along with the estimation of the total contract value and if any of the contract value is constrained. Due to the nature of our business, there is minimal variable consideration, as the contract is established at the acceptance of the order from the customer. When applicable, variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated on a regular basis until the contract is completed. Allocating the transaction price to a specific performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling prices includes estimating the standalone selling prices including discounts and variable consideration.
Inventories.
 Live chicken and pig inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and breeder hen, breeder sow and boar inventories at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value. The costs associated with breeder hen inventories are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive lives using the unit-of-production method. The costs associated with breeder sow inventories are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized on a straight-line basis over their productive lives to the estimated residual cull value. The costs associated with finished poultry products, finished pork products, feed, eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average) or net realizable value. Inventory typically transfers from one stage of production to another at a standard cost, where it accumulates additional cost directly incurred with the production of inventory, including overhead. The standard cost at which each type of inventory transfers is set by management to reflect the actual costs incurred in the prior steps. We monitor and adjust standard costs throughout the year to ensure that standard costs reasonably reflect the actual average cost of the inventory produced. 
We allocate meat costs between our various finished chicken products based on a by-product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This primarily includes leg quarters, wings, tenders and offal, which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts, with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost. We allocate meat costs between our various finished pork products based on a by-product costing technique that allocates the cost of the whole pig into the primal cuts by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This primarily includes legs, shoulders, bellies, offal and fifth quarter parts, which are carried in inventory at the estimated recoverable amounts, with the remaining amount being reflected as our loin meat cost. 
 For our prepared foods inventories, raw materials and packaging materials are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value, work in progress is valued at the latest production cost (raw materials, packaging), finished goods are valued at the lower of the latest actual monthly production cost (raw materials, packaging and direct labor) and attributable overheads and net realizable value, and engineering spares and consumables are valued at cost with an appropriate provision for obsolete engineering spares consistent with historical practice.
Generally, we perform an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are required at the country level based on a number of factors, including: (1) pools of related inventory, (2) product continuation or discontinuation, (3) estimated market selling prices and (4) expected distribution channels. If actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. We also record valuation adjustments, when necessary, for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence, including significantly aged products, discontinued product lines, or damaged or obsolete products.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, net. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Identified intangible assets represent trade names and customer relationships arising from acquisitions that are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization, if any. We use various market valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our identified intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. For goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying 
32
Table of Contents

amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent), that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the unit’s carrying amount (including goodwill). If management determines it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill might be impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. Management has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. Management would be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing quantitative impairment tests, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units with material goodwill carrying amounts using an income approach (discounted cash flow method). We develop projections for cash flows over a 5-year period based on assumptions about revenue growth and margin changes using internally-developed economic projections and industry data obtained from government authorities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other sources. We also make terminal value assumptions about revenue growth and margin changes for periods beyond the projection period. We utilize margin assumptions based on operating performance expectations, margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries, and general macroeconomic trends. We utilize the weighted average cost of capital as a proxy for the discount rate. We consider reporting units that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of future goodwill impairment. 
In 2022, we reviewed relevant qualitative factors and determined that no indicators of goodwill impairment existed for our Moy Park, Pilgrim’s Food Masters, Pilgrim’s Mexico, and Pilgrim’s U.S. reporting units. Our Pilgrim’s U.K. reporting unit reported goodwill of $2.1 million at December 25, 2022. These amounts were considered immaterial to warrant quantitative goodwill impairment testing. 
In 2023, we experienced (1) an increase in long-term treasury rates that management determined could negatively affect discount rates and (2) continued inflationary pressures impacting primarily our Moy Park and Pilgrim’s Food Masters reporting units that management determined could negatively affect our margins. Both discount rates and margins are used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Therefore, management elected to bypass qualitative assessments and performed quantitative goodwill impairment tests for the Moy Park, Pilgrim’s Food Masters, Pilgrim’s Mexico, and Pilgrim’s U.S. reporting units as of December 31, 2023. Our Pilgrim’s U.K. reporting unit reported goodwill of $2.3 million at December 31, 2023. This amount was considered immaterial to warrant quantitative goodwill impairment testing. Based on the outcome of the quantitative tests, management determined that no goodwill impairment existed in the Moy Park, Pilgrim’s Food Masters, Pilgrim’s Mexico, or Pilgrim’s U.S. reporting units as of December 31, 2023.
On July 1, 2024, the Company effectively completed a reorganization within its Europe reportable segment. The previous reporting units were Moy Park, Pilgrim's UK, and Pilgrim's Food Masters. The new reporting units are Fresh Pork/Lamb, Fresh Poultry, Food Service, Meals, and Brands & Snacking. As a result of this reorganization, the Company reassigned assets and liabilities to the applicable reporting units and allocated goodwill using the relative net assets approach. The Company then performed an interim impairment test on the reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis. There was no impairment recognized as a result of these tests. 
As of December 29, 2024, the Company assessed qualitative factors to determine if it was necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amounts of its goodwill. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amount of its goodwill at that date. 
Other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an indefinite-life intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value of that intangible asset. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that an intangible asset is impaired. If management determines there is an indication that the carrying amount of the intangible asset might be impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. Management has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-life intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. 
The fair value of our indefinite-life intangible assets is calculated principally using a relief-from-royalty valuation approach, which uses significant unobservable inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under this valuation approach, we make estimates and assumptions about brand sales growth, royalty rates and discount rates based on specific brand sales projections, general economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. We consider indefinite-life intangible assets that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount to have a heightened risk of future impairment. Our 2022 indefinite-life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge.
33
Table of Contents

In 2023, we experienced an increase in long-term treasury rates that management determined could negatively affect discount rates, which are used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Therefore, management elected to bypass qualitative assessments for all indefinite-life intangible assets and performed quantitative impairment tests. Based on the outcome of the quantitative tests, management determined that no material impairment existed as of December 29, 2024.
The Company additionally assessed if the Pilgrim’s Europe reorganization indicated that any carrying amounts of its non-goodwill intangible assets might not be recoverable. The reorganization did not result in any change in business use for any of the intangible assets and therefore, the Company determined no indicators were present that required us to test the recoverability of the asset group-level carrying amounts of its Europe intangible assets at that date. 
As of December 29, 2024, the Company assessed qualitative factors to determine if it was necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amounts of its intangible assets not subject to amortization. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amount of its intangible assets not subject to amortization at that date. 
Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, such as customer relationships and trade names that we expect to use for a limited amount of time, are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The useful lives range from 15 to 20 years for trade names and three to 18 years for customer relationships. Identified intangible assets with definite lives are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management assessed if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the aggregate carrying amount of its identified intangible assets with definite lives might not be recoverable and determined that there were no impairment indicators during the years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Litigation and Contingent Liabilities.
 We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to employment, environmental, product, and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, to these matters. We estimate the amount of reserves required for these contingencies when losses are determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We expense legal costs related to such loss contingencies as they are incurred. With respect to our environmental remediation obligations, the accrual for environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an undiscounted basis. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in our assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies, or other factors beyond our control.
Income Taxes.
 We follow provisions under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, with regard to members of a group that file a consolidated tax return but issue separate financial statements. We file certain state unitary returns with JBS USA Food Company Holdings. Our income tax expense is computed using the separate return method. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. For the unitary states, we have an obligation to make tax payments to JBS USA Food Company Holdings for our share of the unitary taxable income, which is included in taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred tax on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on the tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions as a part of the income tax provision.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. 
We sponsor four qualified defined benefit pension plans, two nonqualified defined benefit retirement plans, and one defined benefit postretirement life insurance plan. Some of these plans are administered by a board of trustees made up of management within the participating companies and representatives from associated labor groups while others are administered by an investment committee made up of management from the participating company. We use independent third-party actuaries to assist in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. We, along with the actuaries, review assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to participants. We accumulate and amortize the impact of actuarial gains and losses over future periods.
Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgments. The key assumptions made in developing key estimates include discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. These assumptions can have a material impact on the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rates reflect yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and were compared to the effective discount rate determined by discounting plan cash flows using the 12/27/2024 Empower Above Mean Curve. All other assumptions reflect estimates of future experience and considering relevant historical information, such as credible plan experience, from representative populations and relevant plan characteristics. The mortality 
34
Table of Contents

assumption reflects experience from representative populations, based on the Pri-2012 Private Retirement Plans Mortality Table Report issued by the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”) in October 2019 and the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report issued by the SOA in October 2021. It is reasonable to expect that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions noted above that are used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods.
During 2024, we terminated our Pilgrim’s Pride Pension Plan for Legacy Gold Kist (“LGK Plan”) and our Pilgrim’s Pride Retirement Plan for Union Employees (“Union Plan”). The termination included settling all outstanding obligations through a combination of lump-sum payouts to participants who elected to receive one and through a purchase of annuities for the participants who did not elect a lump-sum payout. In order to fund the lump-sum payments and purchases of nonparticipating annuity contracts, all invested assets within each of the two plans was liquidated. The remaining assets within the two plans at the end of the year represents an excess of the liquidated assets over the amount of outstanding obligations at time of termination. These assets will be split between an amount transferred to our qualifying 401(k) retirement plan and an amount reverted to the Company less applicable excise taxes in Q1 2025.
We evaluated the termination of our LGK and Union Plans to confirm if this transaction met the definition of a settlement as defined under ASC Topic 715 
Compensation—Retirement Benefits
, which defines a settlement as “a transaction that is an irrevocable action, relieves the employer (or the plan) of primary responsibility for a pension or postretirement obligation, and eliminates significant risks related to the obligation and the assets used to effect the settlement.” The termination of our LGK and Union Plans was an irrevocable action that relieved us from the pension obligations through the payment of lump-sum payouts and nonparticipating annuity purchases using the liquidated assets of the plans. Additionally, through the termination and settlement of all obligations, we eliminated the significant risks associated with maintaining the obligations and assets. Through this analysis, it was determined we met the criteria of a full settlement of the pension obligations, we applied settlement accounting which required us to recognize the net loss remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time of settlement as a net loss in 
Miscellaneous, net
 on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 29, 2024.
Business Combination Accounting
. We allocate the consideration of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded to goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill. We typically engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of tangible long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill. The fair value of acquired inventories is typically determined by extending physical counts of the inventories taken at or near the acquisition date to market pricing in effect for such inventories at or near the acquisition date. The carrying values of acquired receivables and accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values as of the business combination date. As necessary, we may engage third-party specialists to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities. We adjust the preliminary acquisition accounting, as necessary, typically up to one year after the acquisition closing date for those items that existed at the acquisition date and were provisionally accounted for at that time, as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. 
Our acquisition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including changes in assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions used to determine fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have an impact on our net earnings.
Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
“EBITDA” is defined as the sum of net income (loss) plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated by adding to EBITDA certain items of expense and deducting from EBITDA certain items of income that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance consisting of: (1) foreign currency transaction losses (gains), (2) costs related to litigation settlements, (3) restructuring activities losses, (4) loss on settlement of pension from plan termination, (5) inventory write-down as a result of hurricane, and (6) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EBITDA is presented because it is used by us and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, in addition to and not in lieu of results prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, to compare the performance of companies. We believe investors would be interested in our Adjusted EBITDA because this is how our management analyzes EBITDA applicable to continuing operations. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA, in combination with our financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain significant items on EBITDA and facilitates a more direct comparison of our performance with our competitors.

Table of Contents

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of these measures are:
•
They do not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
They do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
•
Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
•
They are not adjusted for all noncash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows;
•
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges attributable to noncontrolling interests;
•
They do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operations; and
•
They do not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us.
In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market Risk-Sensitive Instruments and Positions
The risk inherent in our market risk-sensitive instruments and positions is primarily the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the credit quality of available-for-sale securities as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ from those described below.
Commodity Prices 
We purchase certain commodities, primarily corn, soybean meal, soybean oil, and wheat, for use as ingredients in the feed we either sell commercially or consume in our live operations. As a result, our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients. We have from time to time attempted to minimize our exposure to the changing price and availability of such feed ingredients using various techniques, including, but not limited to, (1) executing purchase agreements with suppliers for future physical delivery of feed ingredients at established prices and (2) purchasing or selling derivative financial instruments such as futures and options.
For this sensitivity analysis, market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the weighted-average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of the periods presented. The impact of this fluctuation, if realized, could be mitigated by related commodity hedging activity. However, fluctuations greater than 10% could occur.

Based on our feed consumption, a 10% increase in the price of our feed ingredient purchases would have increased cost of sales for the year ended December 29, 2024.

(a)
We purchase commodity derivative financial instruments, specifically exchange-traded futures and options, in an attempt to mitigate price risk related to our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for the next 12 months. A 10% increase in corn, soybean meal, soybean oil and wheat prices would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset position, including margin cash, as of December 29, 2024.
Interest Rates
Fixed-rate debt
. Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10%. Using a discounted cash flow analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $101.4 million as of December 29, 2024.
Foreign Currency
Mexico Foreign Investments
We are exposed to foreign exchange-related variability of investments and earnings from our Mexican subsidiaries. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this sensitivity analysis, market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates used to convert Mexican peso to U.S. dollars, and the effect of this change on our Mexican foreign investments.
Net Assets. 
As of December 29, 2024, our Mexican subsidiaries that are denominated in Mexican peso had net assets of $796.9 million. A 10% weakening in Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar exchange rate would cause a decrease in the net assets of our Mexican subsidiaries by $72.4 million. A 10% strengthening in the Mexican peso against the U.S dollar exchange rate would cause an increase in the net assets of our Mexican subsidiaries of $88.5 million
We are also exposed to the effect of potential currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from Mexico to the U.S. The Mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Europe Foreign Investments
We are exposed to foreign exchange-related variability of investments and earnings from our Europe subsidiaries. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this sensitivity analysis, market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates used to convert British pound and euro to U.S. dollars, and the effect of this change on our Europe foreign investments.
Net Assets.
 As of December 29, 2024, our Europe subsidiaries that are denominated in the British pound had net assets of $0.8 billion. A 10% weakening in the British pound against the U.S. dollar exchange rate would cause a decrease in the net assets of our Europe subsidiaries by $70.7 million. A 10% strengthening in the British pound against the U.S. dollar exchange rate would cause an increase in the net assets of our Europe subsidiaries by $86.4 million.
Cash flow hedging transactions. 
We periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency risk on a portion of sales generated and purchases made by our Europe reportable segment. A 10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and U.S. dollar against the euro would result in immaterial changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments. No assurance can be given as to how future movements in currency rates could affect our future financial condition or results of operations.
Quality of Investments
Certain retirement plans that we sponsor invest in a variety of financial instruments. We have analyzed our portfolios of investments and, to the best of our knowledge, none of our investments, including money market funds units, commercial paper and municipal securities, have been downgraded, and neither we nor any fund in which we participate hold significant

amounts of structured investment vehicles, auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, credit derivatives, hedge funds investments, fund of funds investments or perpetual preferred securities. Certain postretirement funds in which we participate hold significant amounts of mortgage-backed securities. However, none of the mortgages collateralizing these securities are considered subprime.
Impact of Inflation
The U.S., Mexico and most of Europe continue to experience inflation at above-historical levels, though to a lesser degree than in the prior year. None of the locations in which we operate are experiencing hyperinflation. We have responded to these inflationary challenges by continuing negotiations with customers to recoup the extraordinary costs we have experienced. We also continue to focus on operational initiatives that aim to deliver labor efficiencies, better agricultural performance and improved yields.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Pilgrim's Pride Corporation:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
40
Table of Contents

only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of quantitative goodwill impairment assessment
As discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of December 29, 2024 was $1.2. billion, of which $1.1 billion related to reporting units within the Company’s Europe reportable segment. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed a reorganization within its Europe reportable segment. As a result of the reorganization, the Company reassigned assets and liabilities to the reporting units and allocated goodwill. The Company then performed pre- and post-reorganization quantitative impairment tests to determine whether the fair value of each of the reporting units was less than their carrying amounts.
We identified the evaluation of the post-reorganization quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on July 1, 2024 related to certain reporting units within the Company’s Europe reportable segment as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate certain key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the reporting units. These key assumptions included forecasted revenue growth, forecasted margins, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Changes in these assumptions could have had an impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s quantitative goodwill impairment assessments as of July 1, 2024 for certain reporting units within the Company’s Europe reportable segment, including controls over the key assumptions listed above. We evaluated the Company’s assessments by:
•
assessing the Company’s forecasted revenue growth and forecasted margins against underlying business strategies, growth plans, and comparable companies
•
comparing historical revenue growth and margins to forecasts to assess the Company’s ability to forecast.
In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•
evaluating the discount rates used by comparing the Company’s inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable companies and assessing the resulting discount rates
•
comparing the selected terminal growth rates to the Company’s growth expectations using publicly available industry and economic data.

BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (referred to herein as “Pilgrim’s,” “PPC,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar terms) is one of the largest food companies in the world, with operations in the United States (“U.S.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Mexico, France, Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland. Pilgrim’s is primarily a chicken producer, with pork and lamb operations in the U.K. Pilgrim’s products are sold to foodservice, retail and frozen entrée customers. The Company’s primary distribution is through retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurants throughout the countries listed above. Additionally, the Company exports chicken and pork products (from its U.K. operations) to over 
120
 countries. Our fresh products consist of refrigerated whole or cut-up chicken, selected chicken parts that are either marinated or non-marinated, primary pork cuts, added value pork, pork ribs and lamb products. The Company’s prepared products include fully cooked, ready-to-cook and individually frozen chicken parts, strips, nuggets and patties, processed sausages, bacon, smoked meat, gammon joints, pre-packed meats, sandwich and deli counter meats and meat balls. The Company’s other products include plant-based protein offerings, ready-to-eat meals, multi-protein frozen foods, vegetarian foods and desserts. The Company also provides direct-to-consumer meals and hot food to-go solutions in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. We operate feed mills, hatcheries, processing plants and distribution centers in 
14
 U.S. states, the U.K., Mexico, France, Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company operates on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year in the notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal year 2024 was a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2023 was a 53-week fiscal year.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) using management’s best estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and judgments. Significant estimates made by the Company include the allowance for credit losses, reserves related to inventory obsolescence or valuation, useful lives of long-lived assets, goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, insurance accruals, valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits obligations, income tax accruals, certain derivative positions and valuations of acquired businesses.
The functional currency of the Company’s U.S. operations and certain holding-company subsidiaries in Luxembourg, the U.K., Malta and the Republic of Ireland is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of its U.K. operations is the British pound. The functional currency of the Company’s operations in France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland is the euro. The Company has determined that there was a significant change in economic factors that necessitated a reassessment of the appropriate functional currency of the Mexico reportable segment. The primary economic factors driving the change include 1) the recent sustained, historical strengthening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and against other global currencies without a correlated impact on the average product sales prices of our Mexico operations and 2) a shift in the proportional volume of spend we have that is denominated in Mexican peso in relation to spend that is denominated in U.S. dollar. As a result of this reassessment, on April 1, 2024, the Company changed the functional currency of its Mexico operations from U.S. dollar to the Mexican peso. The change in the functional currency was accounted for on April 1, 2024, and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For foreign currency-denominated entities, including the Company’s Mexico operations after April 1, 2024, translation from local currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from translation of these financial records are reflected as a separate component of 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the Company’s Mexico operations prior to April 1, 2024, remeasurement from the Mexican peso to U.S. dollars was performed for monetary assets and liabilities using the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Remeasurement was performed for non-monetary assets using the historical exchange rate in effect on the date of each asset’s acquisition. Income and expense accounts were remeasured using average exchange rates for the period. Net adjustments that resulted from remeasurement of the financial records, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, are reflected in 
Foreign currency transaction losses (gains) 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company or its subsidiaries may use derivatives for the purpose of mitigating exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue Recognition
The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from contracts which are based upon a customer ordering its products. While there may be master agreements, the contract is only established when the customer’s order is accepted by the Company. The Company accounts for a contract, which may be verbal or written, when it is approved and committed by both parties, the rights of the parties are identified along with payment terms, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable.
The Company evaluates the transaction for distinct performance obligations, which are the sale of its products to customers. Since its products are commodity market-priced, the sales price is representative of the observable, standalone selling price. Each performance obligation is recognized based upon a pattern of recognition that reflects the transfer of control to the customer at a point in time, which is upon destination (customer location or port of destination), and depicts the transfer of control and recognition of revenue. There are instances of customer pick-up at the Company’s facilities, in which case control transfers to the customer at that point and the Company recognizes revenue. The Company’s performance obligations are typically fulfilled within days to weeks of the acceptance of the order.
The Company makes judgments regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from revenue and cash flows with customers. Determination of a contract requires evaluation and judgment along with the estimation of the total contract value and if any of the contract value is constrained. Due to the nature of our business, there is minimal variable consideration, as the contract is established at the acceptance of the order from the customer. When applicable, variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated on a regular basis until the contract is completed. Allocating the transaction price to a specific performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling prices includes estimating the standalone selling prices including discounts and variable consideration.
Shipping and Handling Costs
In the rare case when shipping and handling activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the good, the Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good. When revenue is recognized for the related good before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued. Shipping and handling costs are recorded within cost of sales.

Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.

70.1
 million, $
56.7

12.4
 million, $

 million and $

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s disbursement bank accounts are zero balance accounts where cash needs are funded as checks are presented for payment by the holder. Checks issued pending clearance that result in overdraft balances for accounting purposes are classified as accounts payable and the change in the related balance is reflected in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Restricted Cash
The Company is required to maintain cash balances with a broker as collateral for exchange traded futures contracts. These balances are classified as restricted cash as they are not available for use by the Company to fund daily operations. The balance of restricted cash may also include investments in U.S. Treasury Bills that qualify as cash equivalents, as required by the broker, to offset the obligation to return cash collateral.
The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total of the same amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Investments
The Company’s current investments are all highly liquid investments classified as either cash equivalents or short-term investments with an original maturity of less than one year at time of acquisition. The Company’s current investments are comprised of fixed income securities, such as commercial paper. These investments are c
lassified as available-for-sale. These securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Investments in fixed income securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase for funding operations in less than one year are classified as current assets. Investments in fixed income securities with remaining maturities in excess of one year that management has not identified at the time of purchase for funding operations in less than one year are classified as long-term assets. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Management reviews several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the impact of changing interest rates in the short and long term, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company determines the cost of each security sold and each amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a settlement date basis.
Investments in entities in which the Company has an ownership interest greater than 50% and exercises control over the entity are consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments in entities in which the Company has an ownership interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. The Company invests from time to time in ventures in which its ownership interest is less than 20% and over which it does not exercise significant influence. Such investments are accounted for under the cost method. The fair values for investments not traded on a quoted exchange are estimated based upon the historical performance of the ventures, the ventures’ forecasted financial performance and management’s evaluation of the ventures’ viability and business models. To the extent the book value of an investment exceeds its assessed fair value, the Company will record an appropriate impairment charge.
Accounts Receivable
The Company records accounts receivable when revenue is recognized. We record an allowance for expected credit losses, reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for credit losses are based on historical collection experience, current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. We write off accounts receivable when it becomes apparent, based upon age or customer circumstances, that such amounts will not be collected. Generally, the Company does not require collateral for its accounts receivable.
Inventories
Live chicken and pig inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and breeder hen, breeder sow and boar inventories are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value. The costs associated with breeder hen inventories are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive lives using the unit-of-production method. The costs associated with breeder sow inventories are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized on a straight-line basis over their productive lives to the estimated residual cull value. Finished poultry products, finished pork products, feed, eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average) or net realizable value. Inventory typically transfers from one stage of production to another at a standard cost, where it accumulates additional cost directly incurred with the production of inventory, including overhead. The standard cost at which each type of inventory transfers is set by management to reflect the actual costs incurred in the prior steps. We monitor and adjust standard costs throughout the year to ensure that standard costs reasonably reflect the actual average cost of the inventory produced.
The Company allocates meat costs between its various finished chicken products based on a by-product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This primarily includes leg quarters, wings, tenders and offal, which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts, with the remaining amount being reflected as its breast meat cost. The Company allocates meat costs between its various 
49
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
finished pork products based on a by-product costing technique that allocates the cost of the whole pig into the primal cuts by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This primarily includes legs, shoulders, bellies, offal and fifth quarter parts, which are carried in inventory at the estimated recoverable amounts, with the remaining amount being reflected as our loin meat cost. 
 The Company values its other prepared foods products, raw materials and packaging materials at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. Work in progress is valued at the latest production cost (raw materials, packaging), finished goods are valued at the lower of the latest actual monthly production cost (raw materials, packaging and direct labor) and attributable overheads and net realizable value, and engineering spares and consumables are valued at cost with an appropriate provision for obsolete engineering spares consistent with historical practice.
Generally, the Company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are required at the country level based on a number of factors, including: (1) pools of related inventory, (2) product continuation or discontinuation, (3) estimated market selling prices and (4) expected distribution channels. If actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. The Company also records valuation adjustments, when necessary, for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence, including significantly aged products, discontinued product lines, or damaged or obsolete products.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in 
Operating lease assets, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities,
 and 
Noncurrent operating lease liabilities, less current maturities,
 in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in 
Property, plant and equipment, net, Current maturities of long-term debt 
and
 Long-term debt, less current maturities
 in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. IBR is derived from the Company’s credit facility’s margin as a basis with adjustments to periodically updated SOFR swap rate and foreign currency curve. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made, including upfront costs and prepayments, and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with a corresponding reduction to the operating lease asset.
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, and repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Estimated useful lives for building, machinery and equipment are 
five
 to 
33
 years and for automobiles and trucks are 
three
 to 
ten years
. The charge to income resulting from amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included within depreciation expense.
The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets held for use when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. When the above is true, the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. In making these determinations, the Company utilizes certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (1) future cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, remaining length of service and estimated salvage values, (2) estimated fair market value of the assets and (3) determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment test, generally groupings of related operational facilities. Given the interdependency of the Company’s individual facilities during the production process, which operate as a vertically integrated network, it evaluates impairment of assets held for use at the country level (i.e., the U.S. and Mexico). Management believes this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for its assets that are held for use in production activities. At the present time, the Company’s forecasts indicate that it can recover the carrying value of its assets held for use based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the operations. 
50
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets held for sale when the carrying amount of those assets exceeds their fair value less appropriate selling costs. Fair value is based on amounts documented in sales contracts or letters of intent accepted by the Company, amounts included in counteroffers initiated by the Company, or, in the absence of current contract negotiations, amounts determined using a sales comparison approach for real property and amounts determined using a cost approach for personal property. Under the sales comparison approach, sales and asking prices of reasonably comparable properties are considered to develop a range of unit prices within which the current real estate market is operating. Under the cost approach, a current cost to replace the asset new is calculated and then the estimated replacement cost is reduced to reflect the applicable decline in value resulting from physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. Appropriate selling costs includes reasonable broker’s commissions, costs to produce title documents, filing fees, legal expenses and the like.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, net
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Identified intangible assets represent trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements arising from acquisitions that are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization, if any. The Company uses various market valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its identified intangible assets.
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. For goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent), that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the unit’s carrying amount (including goodwill). If management determines it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill might be impaired, a quantitative analysis is performed. Management performed a qualitative analysis noting that is was not more likely than not that there was goodwill impairment in any of its reporting units as of December 29, 2024. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value of that intangible asset. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that an intangible asset is impaired. If management determines there is an indication that the carrying amount of the intangible asset might be impaired, and quantitative analysis is performed. Management performed a qualitative analysis noting that it was not more likely than not that there was impairment for any of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 29, 2024.
Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, such as customer relationships and trade names that the Company expects to use for a limited amount of time, are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The useful lives range from 
15
 to 
20
 years for trade names and 
three
 to 
18
 years for customer relationships. Identified intangible assets with definite lives are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management assessed if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the aggregate carrying amount of its identified intangible assets with definite lives might not be recoverable and determined that there were 
no
 impairment indicators during the years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Litigation and Contingent Liabilities
The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to employment, environmental, product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, to these matters. The Company estimates the amount of reserves required for these contingencies when losses are determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual issue. The Company expenses legal costs related to such loss contingencies as they are incurred. The accrual for environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an undiscounted basis. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Company’s assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies, or other factors beyond the Company’s control.
Accrued Self Insurance
Insurance expense for casualty claims and employee-related health care benefits are estimated using historical and current experience and actuarial estimates. Stop-loss coverage is maintained with third-party insurers to limit the Company’s total exposure. Certain categories of claim liabilities are actuarially determined. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management. However, actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company monitors certain asset retirement obligations in connection with its operations. These obligations relate to clean-up, removal or replacement activities and related costs for “in-place” exposures only when those exposures are moved or modified, such as during renovations of our facilities. These in-place exposures include asbestos, refrigerants, wastewater, oil, lubricants and other contaminants common in manufacturing environments. Under existing regulations, the Company is not required to remove these exposures and there are no plans to undertake a renovation that would require removal of the asbestos or the remediation of the other in-place exposures at this time. The facilities are expected to be maintained and repaired by activities that will not result in the removal or disruption of these in-place exposures at this time. As a result, there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which the Company may incur these liabilities is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. Therefore, the Company has not recorded the fair value of any potential liability.
Income Taxes
The Company follows provisions stated in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, with regard to members of a group that file a consolidated tax return but issue separate financial statements. The Company files certain state unitary returns with JBS USA Food Company Holdings (“JBS USA Holdings”). The income tax expense of the Company is computed using the separate return method. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. For the unitary states, we have an obligation to make tax payments to JBS USA Holdings for our share of the unitary taxable income, which is included in taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred tax on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on the tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date. 
The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, potential for carry back of tax losses, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been established primarily for net operating loss carry forwards of certain foreign subsidiaries.
The Company deems its earnings from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Malta as of December 29, 2024 to be permanently reinvested. As such, U.S. deferred income taxes have not been provided on these earnings. If such earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, certain deferred foreign and U.S. income taxes would be provided.
The Company follows provisions within ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, that provide a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. See “Note 12. Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On December 30, 2024 the Company entered into a tax sharing agreement (the “Tax Sharing Agreement”) with JBS USA governing the allocation, and certain payment and reimbursement obligations of U.S. income tax liabilities and assets among the Company and its relevant U.S. corporate subsidiaries, on the one hand, and JBS USA and its relevant U.S. subsidiaries, on the other hand. The Tax Sharing Agreement is effective for each tax year beginning on or after December 30, 2024 or such other date in which PPC becomes a member of the Parent Consolidated Group (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.15 to this Annual Report.
Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits
Our pension and other postemployment benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions relate to discount rates, long-term return on plan assets and other factors. We base the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high-quality corporate long-term bonds. We determine the long-term return on plan assets based on historical portfolio results and management’s expectation of the future economic environment. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and, if in excess of the lesser of

10% of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets, amortized over either (1) the estimated average future service period of active plan participants if the plan is active or (2) the estimated average future life expectancy of all plan participants if the plan is frozen.
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments (e.g., futures, forwards options and swaps) for the purpose of mitigating exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
•
Commodity Price Risk - 
The Company utilizes various raw materials, which are all considered commodities, in its operations, including corn, soybean meal, soybean oil, wheat, natural gas, electricity and diesel fuel. The Company considers these raw materials to be generally available from a number of different sources and believes it can obtain them to meet its requirements. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations and related price risk due to factors beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions, supply and demand, weather, governmental regulation and other circumstances. Generally, the Company enters into derivative contracts such as physical forward contracts and exchange-traded futures or option contracts in an attempt to mitigate price risk related to its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods up to 12 months. The Company may enter into longer-term derivatives on particular commodities if deemed appropriate.
•
Foreign Currency Risk - 
The Company has foreign operations and, therefore, has exposure to foreign exchange risk when the financial results of those operations are translated to U.S. dollars. The Company will occasionally purchase derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts in an attempt to mitigate currency exchange rate exposure in its Mexico reportable segment. The Co
mpany’s Europe rep
ortable segment also attempts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies through the use of derivative financial instruments.
•
Interest Rate Risk - 
The Company has exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments due to the use of variable interest rates on certain long-term debt arrangements. The Company has purchased in the past an interest rate swap contract to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate on a portion of its outstanding long-term debt arrangements in order to manage this interest rate risk and add stability to interest expense and cash flows. 
Pilgrim’s recognizes all commodity derivative instruments that qualify for derivative accounting treatment as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value unless they qualify for, and we elect, the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception (“NPNS”). The permitted accounting treatments include: cash flow hedge; fair value hedge; and undesignated contracts. Undesignated contract accounting is the default accounting treatment for all derivatives unless they qualify, and we specifically designate them, for one of the other accounting treatments. Derivatives designated for any of the elective accounting treatments must meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis.
The Company has generally applied the NPNS exception for certain of its forward physical grain purchase and energy purchase contracts. NPNS contracts are accounted for using the accrual method of accounting; therefore, there were no amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Undesignated contracts may include contracts not designated as a hedge or for which the NPNS exception was not elected, contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives that do not or no longer qualify for the NPNS scope exception. The fair value of these derivatives is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 or 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
. Changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income within 
Net sales
, 
Cost of sales
 or 
SG&A expense
, depending on the risk they are intended to mitigate. While management believes these instruments help mitigate various market risks, they are not designated nor accounted for as hedges as a result of the extensive record keeping requirements.

Business Combination Accounting
Pilgrim’s allocates the consideration of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded to goodwill. The Company uses all available information to estimate fair values. Pilgrim’s uses various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill. The Company typically engages third-party valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of tangible long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill. The fair value of acquired inventories is determined by extending physical counts of the inventories taken at or near the acquisition date to market pricing in effect for such inventories 
53
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
at or near the acquisition date. The carrying values of acquired receivables and accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values as of the business combination date. As necessary, Pilgrim’s may engage third-party specialists to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities. The Company adjusts the preliminary acquisition accounting, as necessary, typically up to one year after the acquisition closing date for those items that existed at the acquisition date and were provisionally accounted for at that time, as it obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. 
The Company’s acquisition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of the Company’s fair value estimates, including changes in assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions used to determine fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have an impact on the Company’s net earnings.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We make significant estimates in regard to realization of deferred tax assets; valuation of long-lived assets; valuation of contingent liabilities and self-insurance liabilities; and valuation of acquired businesses.
Industrial Revenue Bond Transaction
On August 22, 2024, the Company closed an industrial revenue bond transaction with the Douglas-Coffee County Industrial Authority d/b/a Douglas-Coffee County Development Authority (the “County”) in order to receive a 
five-year
 real property tax abatement on the Company’s newly constructed Douglas, Georgia protein conversion facility. Pursuant to this transaction, the County issued an industrial revenue bond for $
130.0
 million principal amount to the Company and then used the proceeds of the bond issuance to purchase the land and facility from the Company. The County then leased the facility back to the Company under a finance lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of rent in an amount equal to that of bond service costs. The related land and building are recorded as assets in 
Property, plant, and equipment, net
 on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has the legal right to set-off and intends to set-off the corresponding lease and bond service payments, therefore the Company has netted the finance lease obligation with the bond asset. As such, no amount for our obligation under the finance lease or the corresponding industrial revenue bond asset are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company utilizes various raw materials in its operations, including corn, soybean meal, soybean oil, wheat, natural gas, electricity and diesel fuel, which are all considered commodities. The Company considers these raw materials generally available from a number of different sources and believes it can obtain them to meet its requirements. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations and related price risk due to factors beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions, supply and demand, weather, governmental regulation and other circumstances. Generally, the Company purchases derivative financial instruments, specifically exchange-traded futures and options, in an attempt to mitigate price risk related to its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for approximately the next twelve months. The Company may purchase longer-term derivative financial instruments on particular commodities if deemed appropriate.
The Company has operations in Mexico, the U.K., France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, it has exposure to translational foreign exchange risk when the financial results of those operations are remeasured in U.S. dollars. The Company has historically purchased foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of this foreign exchange risk.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The fair value of derivative assets is included in the line item 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while the fair value of derivative liabilities is included in the line item 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
 on the same statements. The Company’s counterparties require that it post collateral for changes in the net fair value of the derivative contracts. This cash collateral is reported in the line item 
Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Undesignated contracts may include contracts not designated as hedges or contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value of each of these derivatives is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 or 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
. Changes in fair value of each derivative are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income within 
Net sales
, 
Cost of sales
, or 
Foreign currency transaction losses (gains)
 depending on the risk the derivative is intended to mitigate. While management believes these instruments help mitigate various market risks, they are not designated and accounted for as hedges as a result of the extensive record keeping requirements.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting treatment to certain derivative financial instruments it has purchased to mitigate commodity purchase exposures in the U.S. and Mexico or foreign currency transaction exposures on our Mexico operations. Therefore, the Company recognized changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments immediately in earnings. Gains or losses related to the commodity derivative financial instruments are included in the line item 
Cost of sales
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses related to cash flows are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
Cash provided by operating activities. 
Unrealized gains and losses related to cash flows are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the line item 
Other operating assets and liabilities. 
Gains or losses related to the foreign currency derivative financial instruments are included in the line item 
Foreign currency transaction losses (gains) 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company does apply hedge accounting treatment to certain derivative financial instruments related to its Europe reportable segment that it has purchased to mitigate foreign currency transaction exposures. Before the settlement date of the financial derivative instruments, the Company recognizes changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge into accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). When the derivative financial instruments are settled, the amount in AOCI is then reclassified to earnings. Gains or losses related to these derivative financial instruments are included in the line item 
Net sales
 and 
Cost of sales
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
We have generally applied the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception (“NPNS”) to our forward physical grain purchase contracts delivered by truck and to our forward physical natural gas and solar-generated power purchase contracts. NPNS contracts are accounted for using the accrual method of accounting; therefore, amounts payable under these contracts are recorded when we take delivery of the contracted product and no amounts were recorded for the fair value of these contracts in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On July 1, 2024, the Company effectively completed a reorganization within its Europe reportable segment. The previous reporting units were Moy Park, Pilgrim's UK, and Pilgrim's Food Masters. The new reporting units are Fresh Pork/Lamb, Fresh Poultry, Food Service, Meals, and Brands & Snacking. As a result of this reorganization, the Company reassigned assets and liabilities to the applicable reporting units and allocated goodwill using the relative net assets approach. The Company then performed an interim impairment test on the reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis. There was no impairment recognized as a result of these tests. The Company additionally assessed if the Pilgrim’s Europe reorganization indicated that any carrying amounts of its non-goodwill intangible assets might not be recoverable. The reorganization did not result in any change in business use for any of the intangible assets and therefore, the Company determined no indicators were present that required us to test the recoverability of the asset group-level carrying amounts of its Europe intangible assets at that date.
As of December 29, 2024, the Company assessed qualitative factors to determine if it was necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amounts of its goodwill or its intangible assets not subject to amortization. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests related to the carrying amount of its goodwill nor its intangible assets not subject to amortization at that date. 
As of December 29, 2024, the Company assessed if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the aggregate carrying amount of its intangible assets subject to amortization might not be recoverable. There were no indicators present that required the Company to test the recoverability of the aggregate carrying amount of its intangible assets subject to amortization at that date.

the Company sold certain PP&E for $

The Company has closed or idled various facilities in the U.S. and the U.K. The Board of Directors has not determined if it would be in the best interest of the Company to divest any of these idled assets. Management is therefore not certain that it can or will divest any of these assets within one year, is not actively marketing these assets and, accordingly, has not classified them as assets held for sale. The Company continues to depreciate these assets. As of December 29, 2024, the carrying amount of these idled assets was $
45.1
 million based on depreciable value of $
185.8
 million and accumulated depreciation of $
140.7
 million. During 2024, the Company recognized an impairment loss on 
PP&E
 of $
28.6
 million incurred as a result of planned restructuring activities in the Europe reportable segment. Additional information regarding restructuring activities is included in “Note 18. Restructuring-Related Activities.”
As of December 29, 2024, the Company assessed if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the aggregate carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment held for use might not be recoverable. There were no indicators present that required the Company to test the recoverability of the aggregate carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment held for use at that date.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.
As of December 29, 2024, the Company believes it has sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its federal, state and foreign net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. As of December 29, 2024, the Company’s valuation allowance is $
86.3
 million, of which $
10.6
 million relates to our Europe operations, $
0.3
 million relates to our Mexico operations, $
50.9
 million relates to Onix Investments UK Limited, Sandstone Holdings Sàrl and Arkose Investments ULC, indirect subsidiaries of Pilgrim’s, $
11.9

Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company used a year-end measurement date of December 29, 2024 for its pension and postretirement benefits plans. Certain disclosures are listed below. Other disclosures are not material to the financial statements.
Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The Company sponsored 
four
 qualified defined benefit pension plans named the Pilgrim’s Pride Retirement Plan for Union Employees (the “Union Plan”), the Pilgrim’s Pride Pension Plan for Legacy Gold Kist Employees (the “GK Pension Plan”), the Tulip Limited Pension Plan (the “Tulip Plan”) and the Geo Adams Group Pension Fund (the “Geo Adams Plan” and, together with the Tulip Plan, the “Europe Plans”). The Union Plan covers certain locations or work groups within PPC. The GK Pension Plan covers certain eligible U.S. employees who were employed at locations that the Company purchased through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. Participation in the GK Pension Plan was frozen as of February 8, 2007 for all participants with the exception of terminated vested participants who are or may become permanently and totally disabled. The plan was frozen for that group as of March 31, 2007. The Europe Plans cover certain eligible active and former Europe employees who were employed at locations that the Company purchased through its acquisition of Tulip in 2019. Participation in the Tulip Plan was frozen as of October 31, 2007 and participation in the Geo Adams Plan was frozen as of September 5, 2008.
During 2024, the Company executed a termination of its Union and GK Pension Plans. Under the plan terminations, participants were offered a lump-sum buyout or an annuity placement buyout. As a result, the Company settled $
99.6
 million of outstanding benefit obligations and recognized a $
21.7
 million loss on settlement during the year ended December 29, 2024. The loss was recognized in 
Miscellaneous, net 
on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Assets of the pension plans were liquidated and funds from liquidation were used to settle the obligations.
Nonqualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The Company sponsors 
two
 nonqualified defined benefit retirement plans named the Former Gold Kist Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP Plan”) and the Former Gold Kist Inc. Directors’ Emeriti Retirement Plan (the “Directors’ Emeriti Plan”). Pilgrim’s Pride assumed sponsorship of the SERP Plan and Directors’ Emeriti Plan through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. The SERP Plan provides benefits on compensation in excess of certain U.S. Internal Revenue Code limitations to certain former executives with whom Gold Kist negotiated individual agreements. Benefits under the SERP Plan were frozen as of February 8, 2007. The Directors’ Emeriti Plan provides benefits to former Gold Kist directors.
Defined Benefit Postretirement Life Insurance Plan
The Company sponsors 
one
 defined benefit postretirement life insurance plan named the Gold Kist Inc. Retiree Life Insurance Plan (the “Retiree Life Plan” and together with the Union Plan, the GK Pension Plan, the SERP Plan and the Directors’ Emeriti Plan, the “U.S. Plans”). Pilgrim’s Pride assumed defined benefit postretirement medical and life insurance obligations, including the Retiree Life Plan, through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. In January 2001, Gold Kist began to substantially curtail its programs for active employees. On July 1, 2003, Gold Kist terminated medical coverage for retirees age 65 or older, and only retired employees in the closed group between ages 55 and 65 could continue their coverage at rates above the average cost of the medical insurance plan for active employees. These retired employees all reached the age of 65 in 2012 and liabilities of the postretirement medical plan then ended.

The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the Company’s pension and other benefit obligations. The discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were based on the Empower Above Mean Curve, which was designed by Empower to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The Empower Above Mean Curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with an AA minimum average credit quality rating as rated by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. The expected benefit payments were discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield curve. For payments beyond 
30
 years, the Company extended the curve assuming the discount rate derived in year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s payment expectations. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments was established, the Company determined the single rate on the yield curve, that when applied to all obligations of the plan, would exactly match the previously determined present value. The discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations for the Europe pension plans at December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were based on corporate bond spot yield curves provided by Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch bases this calculation entirely on AA1-AA3 rated bonds. As part of the evaluation of pension and other postretirement assumptions, the Company applied assumptions for mortality that incorporate generational white and blue collar mortality trends. In determining its benefit obligations, the Company used generational tables that take into consideration increases in plan participant longevity. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans used variations of the Pri-2012 mortality table. The MP-2021 mortality improvement scale was used for 2024 and 2023. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Europe pension plans used variations of the AxC00 mortality table in combination with the CMI_2023 Sk=7.0 and CMI_2022 Sk=7.0 mortality improvement scales for 2024 and 2023, respectively, for pre-retirement employees and the S3PMA and S3PFA_M mortality tables in combination with the CMI_2023 Sk=7.0 and CMI_2022 Sk=7.0 mortality improvement scales for 2024 and 2023, respectively, for postretirement employees. 
The sensitivity of the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits to changes in the discount rate is set out below. The impact of a change in the discount rate of 
0.25
% on the projected benefit obligation for other benefits is immaterial. This sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to variations in significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as that for calculating the liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was primarily based on the determination of an expected return and behaviors for each plan’s current asset portfolio that the Company believes are likely to prevail over long periods. This determination was made using assumptions for return and volatility of the portfolio. Asset class assumptions were set using a combination of empirical and forward-looking analysis. To the extent historical results were affected by unsustainable trends or events, the effects of those trends or events were quantified and removed. The Company also considered anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals when developing this rate.

Pooled separate accounts (“PSAs”) and common collective trust funds (“CCTs”) are two of the most common types of alternative vehicles in which benefit plans invest. These investments are pooled funds that look like mutual funds, but they are not registered with the SEC. Often times, they will be invested in mutual funds or other marketable securities, but the unit price generally will be different from the value of the underlying securities because the fund may also hold cash for liquidity purposes, and the fees imposed by the fund are deducted from the fund value rather than charged separately to investors. Some PSAs and CCTs have no restrictions as to their investment strategy and can invest in riskier investments, such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, or similar investments.
Absent regulatory or statutory limitations, the target asset allocation for the investment of pension assets in the PSAs for the Europe Plans is 
21
% overseas equity, 
21
% diversified alternatives, 
15
% real estate, 
24
% equity-linked liability driven investments, 
11
% other liability driven investments and

% global equities, 
11
% equity-linked liability driven investments, 
15
% liability driven investments, 
16
% corporate bonds and 
35
% cash for the Geo Adams Group Pension Fund. The plans only invest in fixed income and equity instruments for which there is a readily available public market. The Company develops its expected long-term rate of return assumptions based on the historical rates of returns for equity and fixed income securities of the type in which its plans invest.

(g)
This category is comprised of investment options that invest in bonds, or debt of a company or government entity (including U.S. and non-U.S. entities). These investment options typically carry more risk than short-term fixed income investment options, but less overall risk than equities.
(h)
This category is comprised of investment options that invest in real estate investment trusts or private equity pools that own real estate. These long-term investments are primarily in office buildings, industrial parks, apartments or retail complexes. These investment options typically carry more risk, including liquidity risk, than fixed income investment options.

This category is comprised of investments that seek to ensure availability of funds to cover current and future liabilities. These investments are typically focused on both the assets and liabilities of the plan.
Benefit Payments
The following table reflects the benefits as of December 29, 2024 expected to be paid through 2034 from the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans. The Company’s pension plans are primarily funded plans. Therefore, anticipated benefits with respect to these plans will come primarily from the trusts established for these plans. The Company’s other postretirement plans are unfunded. Therefore, anticipated benefits with respect to these plans will come from the Company’s own assets.

Risk Management
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility. 
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets under perform this yield, this will create a deficit. The pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while contributing volatility and risk in the short-term. The Company monitors the level of investment risk but has no current plan to significantly modify the mixture of investments. The investment position is discussed more below.
Changes in bond yields.
 A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
The investment position is managed and monitored by a committee of individuals from various departments. This group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The group does not use derivatives to manage its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The majority of equities are in U.S. large and small cap companies with some global diversification into international entities.
Remeasurement
The Company remeasures both plan assets and obligations on a quarterly basis.

Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors 
two
 defined contribution retirement savings plans in the U.S. reportable segment for eligible U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. The Company maintains 
three
 postretirement plans for eligible employees in the Mexico reportable segment, as required by Mexico law, which primarily cover termination benefits. The Company maintains 
two
 defined contribution retirement savings plans in the Europe reportable segment for eligible Europe employees, as required by Europe law. The Company’s expenses related to its defined contribution plans totaled $
32.5
 million, $
28.5
 million and $
27.0
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

16.    
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company sponsors short-term incentive plans that provide the grant of either cash or stock-based bonus awards payable upon achievement of specified performance goals. As of December 29, 2024, the Company has accrued $
87.9
 million, $
36.7
 million and $
7.8
 million related to cash bonus awards that are recognized in the U.S., Europe, and Mexico reportable segments, respectively.
The Company also sponsors a performance-based, omnibus long-term incentive plan that provides for the grant of a broad range of long-term equity-based and liability-based awards to the Company’s officers and other employees, members of the Board of Directors and any consultants (the “LTIP”). Awards that may be granted under the LTIP include “incentive stock options,” within the meaning of the IRC, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Equity-based awards are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock shortly after award vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized for an equity-based awards grant is determined by multiplying the number of awards granted by the closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the award grant date. Liability-based awards granted under the LTIP are converted into cash shortly after award vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized for a liability-based awards grant is first determined by multiplying the number of awards granted by the closing price of a share of PPC’s common stock on the award grant date. However, the compensation cost to be recognized is adjusted at each subsequent milestone date (i.e., forfeiture date, vesting date or financial reporting date) by multiplying the number of awards granted by the closing price of a share of PPC’s common stock on the milestone date. On May 1, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2019 LTIP”), which replaced the expiring Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2009 LTIP”). The 2019 LTIP became effective as of December 28, 2019. As of December 29, 2024, we have in reserve less than 
0.1
 million shares of common stock for future issuance under the 2019 LTIP.

The milestone date fair value is either the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date for equity-based awards or the closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the respective milestone date for cash-based liability-based awards (i.e., grant date, vesting date, forfeiture date or financial reporting date).
The total fair value of equity-based awards vested during 2024 was $
7.1
 million. 
No
 liability-based awards vested during 2024. The total fair values of equity-based awards and liability-based awards vested during 2023 were $
9.3
 million and $
5.0
 million, respectively.
As of December 29, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested equity-based awards was $
16.9
 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.91
 years. As of December 29, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested liability-based awards was 
immaterial
. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
0.01
 years.
Historically, we have issued new shares, as op
po
sed to treasury shares, to satisfy equity-based award conversions.
17.    
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value must be categorized into one of three different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e., inputs) used in the valuation:
Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level 2
Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability; or
Level 3
Unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.
The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held fixed income securities, derivative assets and derivative liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Fixed income securities consist of investments, such as money market funds and commercial paper. Derivative assets and liabilities consist of long and short positions on exchange-traded commodity futures instruments, commodity options instruments, sales contracts instruments, foreign currency instruments to manage translation and remeasurement risk.

See “Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments” and “Note 7. Investments in Securities” for additional information.
The valuation of financial assets and liabilities classified in Level 1 is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities in Level 2 is determined using a market approach based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The valuation of financial assets in Level 3 is determined using an income approach based on unobservable inputs such as discounted cash flow models or valuations. For each class of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets but for which fair value is disclosed, the Company is not required to provide the quantitative disclosure about significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In addition to the fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair value, accounting standards require interim disclosures regarding the fair value of all of the Company’s financial instruments. The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and any changes in methods or significant assumptions from prior periods are also required to be disclosed.There were no changes to methods or significant assumptions from prior periods.

The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain other liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities. Derivative assets were recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are included in the line item 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative liabilities were recorded at fair value based on quoted market

prices and are included in the line item 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of the Company’s Level 2 fixed-rate debt obligations were based on the quoted market price at December 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023, as applicable. 
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges when required by U.S. GAAP. There were no significant fair value measurement losses recognized for such assets and liabilities in the periods reported.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
The Company operates in 
three
 reportable segments: U.S., Europe and Mexico. The Company’s reportable segments are identified by a combination of factors, including geographic area, regulatory environment, economic environment and product portfolios. Each reportable segment is managed separately through a local management team. The results of each operating, or reportable, segment are provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) on a regular basis. The Company’s CODM is the President and Chief Executive Officer. The information provided to the CODM at the operating segment level is then used to assess performance and make decisions regarding allocation of key resources. The CODM primarily measures segment profit and evaluates performance based on operating income. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
We conduct separate operations in the continental U.S. and in Puerto Rico. For segment reporting purposes, the Puerto Rico operations are included in the U.S. reportable segment. The chicken products processed by the U.S. reportable segment are sold to foodservice, retail and frozen entrée customers. The segment’s primary distribution is through retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurants.
The Europe reportable segment processes primarily fresh chicken, pork products, lamb products, specialty meats, ready meals and other prepared foods that are sold to foodservice, retail and direct to consumer customers. The segment’s primary distribution is through retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurants.
The chicken products processed by the Mexico reportable segment are sold to foodservice, retail and frozen entrée customers. The segment’s primary distribution is through retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurants.
Additional information regarding reportable segments is as follows:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
General
The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. Among other considerations, the Company has not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities because, based upon the likelihood of payment, the fair value of such indemnities would not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
88
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Purchase Obligations
The Company will sometimes enter into noncancelable contracts to purchase capital equipment and certain commodities such as corn, soybean meal, wheat and energy. As of December 29, 2024, the Company was party to outstanding purchase contracts totaling $
400.7
 million payable in 2025, $
23.0
 million payable in 2026, $
1.9
 million payable in 2027, $
1.8
 million payable in 2028 and $
10.7
 million payable thereafter.
Operating Leases
Additional information regarding operating leases is included in “Note 3. Leases.”
Financial Instruments
The Company’s loan agreements generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (1) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (2) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (3) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, some of the Company’s loan agreements contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law. These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the Company’s opinion, it has made appropriate and adequate accruals for claims where necessary; however, the ultimate liability for these matters is uncertain, and if significantly different than the amounts accrued, the ultimate outcome could have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the litigation matters or other actions nor when they will be resolved. The consequences of the pending litigation matters are inherently uncertain, and settlements, adverse actions, or adverse judgments in some or all of these matters, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or the Attorneys General, may result in monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctive relief against the Company, which could be material and could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage the Company’s reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. In addition, the U.S. government’s recent focus on market dynamics in the meat processing industry could expose the Company to additional costs and risks.
Tax Claims and Proceedings
During 2014 and 2015, the Mexican Tax Administration Service (“SAT”) opened a review of Avícola with regard to tax years 2009 and 2010. In both instances, the SAT claims that controlled company status did not exist for certain subsidiaries because Avícola did not own 50% of the shares in voting rights of Incubadora Hidalgo, S. de R.L de C.V. and Comercializadora de Carnes de México S. de R.L de C.V. (both in 2009) and Pilgrim’s Pride, S. de R.L. de C.V. (in 2010). Avícola appealed the opinion, and on January 31, 2023, the appeal as to tax year 2009 was dismissed by the Mexico Supreme Court. Accordingly, during 2023 Avícola paid $
25.9
 million for tax year 2009. The opinion for tax year 2010 is still under appeal. Accordingly, Avícola has an accrual of $
14.4
 million as of December 29, 2024 with regard to the tax year 2010.
On May 12, 2022, the SAT issued tax assessments against Pilgrim’s Pride, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Provemex Holdings, LLC in connection with PPC’s acquisition of Tyson de México. The Mexican subsidiaries of PPC filed a petition to nullify these assessments. The District Court issued a judgement on January 20, 2025, in which the court now claims that the seller owed tax due to the indirect transfer of Mexican assets in connection with the sale, and that PPC or its subsidiaries should have withheld such taxes, but also noted that only one of the assessments will proceed. PPC will appeal and will continue to defend this matter. The amount under appeal for the remaining assessment is approximately $
269.5
 million. 
No
 expense has been recorded for this amount at this time, and PPC have submitted an indemnification claim notice pursuant to the definitive agreement to acquire Tyson de México. There can be no assurances as to whether the indemnification claim will be successful or in what amounts. 
In 2019 and 2020, the UK Revenue & Customs Authority (HMRC) opened reviews of the 2017 and 2018 tax returns of Onix Investments UK Ltd in which HMRC evaluated the deductibility of certain interest related expenses incurred by Onix Investments UK Ltd (the “Deductions”). The Deductions total $
7.9
 million for tax year 2017 and $
32.1
 million for tax year 
89
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2018. On April 12, 2024, HMRC concluded that the Deductions should be disallowed and Onix Investments UK Ltd appealed. On October 8, 2024, HMRC issued a Review Conclusion Letter affirming the prior decision to disallow the Deductions. Onix Investments UK Ltd has timely filed a Grounds of Appeal and will continue to defend this matter.
U.S. Litigation
Between September 2, 2016 and October 13, 2016, a series of federal class action lawsuits were filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (“Illinois Court”) against PPC and other defendants by and on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of broiler chickens alleging violations of antitrust and unfair competition laws and styled as 
In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation,
 Case No. 1:16-cv-08637 (the “Broiler Antitrust Litigation”). The complaints seek, among other relief, treble damages for an alleged conspiracy among defendants to reduce output and increase prices of broiler chickens from the period of January 2008 to the present. PPC has entered into agreements to settle all claims made by the 
three
 certified classes for an aggregate total of $
195.5
 million, each of which has received final approval from the Illinois Court. PPC continues to defend itself against the direct-action plaintiffs as well as parties that have opted out of the class settlements (collectively, the “Broiler Opt Outs”). PPC will seek reasonable settlements with the Broiler Opt Outs where they are available. To date, we have recognized an expense of $
582.5
 million, including a $
45.0
 million incremental increase in the three months ended December 29, 2024, to cover settlements with various Broiler Opt Outs. We have recognized these settlement expenses within 
SG&A

expense
 in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Between August 30, 2019 and October 16, 2019, a series of purported class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (“Maryland Court”) against PPC and a number of other chicken producers, as well as Webber, Meng, Sahl & Company and Agri Stats, styled as 
Jien, et al. v. Perdue Farms, Inc., et al., 
No.19-cv-02521. The plaintiffs are a putative class of poultry processing plant production and maintenance workers (“Poultry Workers Class”) and allege that the defendants conspired to fix and depress the compensation paid to Poultry Workers Class in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. PPC entered into an agreement to settle all claims made by the Poultry Workers Class for $
29.0
 million and paid the plaintiffs this amount during 2021, though the agreement is still subject to final approval by the Maryland Court. We have recognized these settlement expenses within 
SG&A expense
 in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
On January 27, 2017, a purported class action on behalf of broiler chicken farmers was brought against PPC and other chicken producers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging, among other things, a conspiracy to reduce competition for grower services and depress the price paid to growers. The complaint was consolidated with several subsequently filed consolidated amended class action complaints and styled as 
In re Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation
, Case No. CIV-17-033. On June 24, 2024, a settlement was reached in the amount of $
100.0

MARKET RISKS AND CONCENTRATIONS
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investment securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company’s cash equivalents and investment securities are high-quality debt and equity securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. The Company’s trade accounts receivable are generally unsecured. Credit evaluations are performed on all significant customers and updated as circumstances dictate. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company does not have a single customer that exceeds the 10% of net sales. The Company does not believe it has significant concentrations of credit risk in its trade accounts receivable.
As of December 29, 2024, we employed 
over 
61,600
 people. Approximately

35.4
%
 of the Company’s employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements. Substantially all employees covered under collective bargaining agreements are covered under agreements that expire in 2025 or later. We have not experienced any labor-related work stoppage at any location in over

ten years
. We believe our relationship with our employees and union leadership is satisfactory. At any given time, we will likely be in some stage of contract negotiations with various collective bargaining units. In the absence of an agreement, we may become subject to labor disruption at one or more of these locations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
As of December 29, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of net assets belonging to our Mexico and Europe reportable segments was $
0.7
 billion and $
2.9
 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of net assets belonging to our Mexico and Europe reportable segments was $
1.3
 billion and $
