Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section entitled “
Forward-Looking Statements and Market Data
.” As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “
Risk Factors
” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone. Our clinical-stage product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective ASI that we are developing for the treatment of cardiorenal conditions affected by dysregulated aldosterone, including hypertension, CKD, and OSA. In the United States, there are approximately 
-93-
120 million patients have sustained elevated BP, or hypertension, and more than half of this population fails to achieve their BP goals, defined as BP below 130/80 mmHg, with currently available medications. There are over 30 million treated patients who do not achieve their BP goal, of whom approximately 20 million have systolic BP levels greater than 140 mmHg. Patients with hypertension that persists despite taking two or more medications have 1.8 and 2.5 times greater mortality risk due to either cardiovascular disease or stroke, respectively. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating 200 subjects (Target-HTN) with uHTN or rHTN, lorundrostat demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in BP with once-daily dosing and was well tolerated. Dysregulated aldosterone levels are a key factor in driving hypertension in approximately 30% of hypertensive patients. In addition to hypertension, we are investigating the benefits of lorundrostat in subjects with hypertension and CKD and in subjects with hypertension and OSA. We believe that our product candidate holds promise to be an innovative solution for the rapidly growing unmet need in multiple cardiorenal metabolic disorders.
Clinical Highlights
Advance-HTN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to a standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications. Subjects who met screening criteria discontinued their existing hypertension medications and started on a standard regimen of an ARB and a diuretic, if previously on two medications, or a standard regimen of ARB, diuretic and calcium channel blocker if previously on three to five medications. Subjects who remained hypertensive despite the standardized regimen were then randomized into three cohorts for twelve weeks receiving one of the following treatments: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50 mg QD and an option to titrate to 100 mg QD at week four based on defined criteria or placebo. The primary endpoint of Advance-HTN is change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP at week twelve from baseline for each active cohort versus placebo. Randomization of 285 subjects was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and topline data from this trial is anticipated in March 2025.
Our second pivotal trial, Launch-HTN, is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to their existing, prescribed background treatment of two to five antihypertensive medications. Subjects were randomized into three cohorts for twelve weeks receiving one of the following treatments: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50 mg QD and an option to titrate to 100 mg QD at week six based on defined criteria or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial is the assessment of automated office measured systolic BP from baseline for active cohorts versus placebo at six weeks, with the results pooled for all subjects on 50 mg QD. Randomization of 1,083 subjects was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and topline data from this trial is anticipated in mid first half of 2025.
Explore-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-sequence (2x2) crossover trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 25 mg QD lorundrostat in addition to an SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension in subjects with Stage 2 to 3b CKD and albuminuria despite receiving stable treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The primary endpoint is placebo-adjusted change from baseline in systolic BP at week four and an exploratory endpoint is placebo-adjusted percent change from baseline in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at week four. Randomization of 60 subjects was completed in the first quarter of 2025, and topline data from this trial is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025. 
Transform-HTN is an open-label extension trial allowing subjects to continue to receive lorundrostat and to obtain long-term efficacy and safety data. All subjects in the pivotal hypertension program, including the Advance-HTN and Launch-HTN trials, as well as the Explore-CKD trial, will be given the opportunity to participate in the extension trial.
Lorundrostat has been developed to address dysregulated aldosterone, and we believe this mechanism may be applicable to other indications where dysregulated aldosterone biology plays a role. Most recently, we have begun to explore lorundrostat for patients with OSA and hypertension. 
-94-
In January 2025, we announced that the FDA cleared our IND for Explore-OSA to evaluate the effect of lorundrostat in the treatment of subjects with moderate-to-severe OSA and hypertension. We anticipate initiating Explore-OSA in the first quarter of 2025. Explore-OSA is planned to be a placebo-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat 50 mg taken once daily in the evening in approximately 40 subjects with moderate-to-severe OSA. Subjects will be at least 18 years old, with a BMI ≥27 kg/m
2
, and the trial will be conducted across approximately 40 sites. The key objective of this trial is to evaluate the hypothesis that lorundrostat both alleviates the severity of upper airway obstruction and reduces nocturnal hypertension. The primary outcome measure is absolute change in the frequency of apnea-hypopnea episodes compared to placebo. The key secondary objective is to quantify BP throughout the night using continuous BP monitoring during performance of a standard sleep study without the use of CPAP. Standard patient reported outcomes specific to OSA will also be assessed. 
Financial Overview
We commenced our operations in May 2019 and have devoted substantially all of our resources to date to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing our product candidate, lorundrostat, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, and providing other general and administrative support for our operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $198.2 million. From inception through the date of this Annual Report, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $498.8 million from the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. In February 2023, we completed our IPO of 13,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock. Including the option exercise, our aggregate net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $201.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering costs. In February 2024, we sold 8,339,169 shares of common stock and, to certain purchasers, 549,755 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $116.1 million, net of offering expenses, in a private placement offering (the Private Placement).
We do not have any products approved for sale, have not generated any revenue, and have incurred net losses since our inception. Our operations to date have been limited to business planning, raising capital, in-licensing and developing lorundrostat, conducting clinical trials, and other research and development activities. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $177.8 million and $71.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $302.5 million and $124.7 million, respectively. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical development activities and other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as we conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials for lorundrostat, potentially seek regulatory approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may develop, expand our clinical, regulatory, quality, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities, obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property, expand our general and administrative support functions, including hiring additional personnel, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operations for at least twelve months. We have never generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, lorundrostat, which will not be for several years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of lorundrostat, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future

commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. For more information, see “

License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe
In July 2020, we entered into the Mitsubishi License with Mitsubishi Tanabe, pursuant to which Mitsubishi Tanabe granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Mitsubishi Tanabe’s patent and other intellectual property rights to exploit Lorundrostat Products for the prevention, treatment, diagnosis, detection, monitoring, or predisposition testing with respect to indications, diseases, and conditions in humans. Pursuant to the Mitsubishi License, we paid Mitsubishi Tanabe a $1.0 million upfront fee and development milestone payments of $9.0 million in the aggregate. We have remaining obligations to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe commercial milestone payments of up to $155.0 million in the aggregate upon first commercial sale and upon meeting certain annual sales targets, as well as additional commercial milestone payments of up to $10.0 million for a second indication. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to ten percent (10%) of aggregate net sales of each Lorundrostat Product on a Lorundrostat Product-by-Lorundrostat Product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid Mitsubishi Tanabe patent claim covering a Lorundrostat Product, (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of a Lorundrostat Product, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country. Such royalties are subject to reduction under specified conditions, including lack of patent coverage and generic competition. We incurred $0 and $9.0 million of research and development expenses pursuant to the Mitsubishi License during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that related to the initiation of our pivotal clinical program of lorundrostat in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we have paid an aggregate of $9.0 million in development milestone payments and have no remaining development milestone obligations under the Mitsubishi License.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete the development activities and to file for regulatory approval for at least one Lorundrostat Product in a major market country and consider in good faith developing at least one Lorundrostat Product in a non-major market country. If we elect to sublicense our rights under the Mitsubishi License to a third party with respect to exploitation of lorundrostat or any Lorundrostat Product in certain countries in Asia, we have agreed to negotiate such a sublicense first, for a specified period of time, with Mitsubishi Tanabe, if Mitsubishi Tanabe notifies us that it would like to obtain such a sublicense. We also agreed not to commercialize any competing product prior to three years following the first commercial sale of the first Lorundrostat Product in any country without Mitsubishi Tanabe’s prior consent. For additional information regarding the Mitsubishi License, including termination provisions, see “
Business—License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe
.”
Private Placement Offering
On February 7, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the purchasers named therein (the Purchasers), for the Private Placement of (i) 8,339,169 shares (the Shares) of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per Share, and (ii) with respect to certain Purchasers, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 549,755 shares of common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants) in lieu of shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $13.499 per Pre-Funded Warrant (the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the Warrant Shares) for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $116.1 million. We are using the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the research and development of lorundrostat and for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of $0.001 per share of common stock, is immediately exercisable on the date of issuance, and will not expire. Under the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants, we may not effect the exercise of any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant, and a holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant, which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause a holder (together with its affiliates) to own more than a specified beneficial ownership limitation of either 4.99%, 9.99%, or 19.99% (as selected by such holder prior to the issuance of the Pre-Funded Warrant) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, as such percentage 
-96-
ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99%, provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after such notice is delivered to us.
We registered the resale of the Shares and the Warrant Shares on a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-278122), which was declared effective by the SEC on April 11, 2024 (the Registration Statement). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective until the earliest of (i) the time as all of the Shares and Warrant Shares purchased by the Purchasers pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, or (ii) such time as the Shares and Warrant Shares become eligible for resale by non-affiliates without any volume limitations or other restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. 
At Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement
On March 21, 2024, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement) with BofA Securities, Inc. and Evercore Group L.L.C. as our sales agents (the Agents) and/or principals. Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, we may sell from time to time through the Agents shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000 (the ATM Shares). Any ATM Shares will be issued pursuant to the Registration Statement. Sales of the ATM Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or as otherwise agreed by us and the Agents. Under the terms of the ATM Agreement, we may also sell the ATM Shares from time to time to an Agent as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of the ATM Shares to an Agent as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between us and such Agent. We have not yet sold any ATM Shares as of December 31, 2024.
Key Components of Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs related to the development of lorundrostat. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred, and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods are received or when the services are performed.
Research and development expenses include:
•
salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and consultants to conduct and support our clinical trials of lorundrostat, and payments made under the Mitsubishi License; and
•
costs related to manufacturing lorundrostat for our clinical trials.
We have and plan to continue to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of lorundrostat. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration, or the completion costs of current or future clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat or any future product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical and preclinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast whether lorundrostat or any future product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be 
-97-
secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our future development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: 
•
the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities;
•
our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than lorundrostat, and the timing of such development, if any;
•
our ability to receive timely regulatory approvals for lorundrostat, any future product candidates, and additional indications of lorundrostat and any future product candidates, in the jurisdictions in which we or any future partners apply for such approvals;
•
the costs and timing of manufacturing lorundrostat or any future product candidates for use in our trials, including as a result of inflation, any supply chain issues, or component shortages;
•
any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates and timing of seeking approval in such jurisdictions;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of clinical trial patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the relevant product candidate; and
•
the extent to which we establish strategic collaborations or other arrangements.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including employee salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation charges, for personnel in executive and administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, tax and consulting services, and insurance costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the increased costs associated with operating as a public company. These increased costs will likely include increased expenses related to the hiring of additional personnel, audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with the exchange listing and the SEC requirements and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, director and officer insurance costs, investor and public relations costs, business development, and medical affairs.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to increases of $88.7 million in preclinical and clinical costs, driven by the initiation of the lorundrostat pivotal program in the second quarter of 2023, $10.6 million in clinical supply, manufacturing, and regulatory costs, $7.0 million in higher compensation expense resulting from additions to headcount, increases in salaries and accrued bonuses, and increased stock-based compensation, and $0.9 million in other research and development expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $9.0 million in license fees associated with development milestone payments in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to $6.6 million in higher compensation expense resulting from additions to headcount, increases in salaries and accrued bonuses, and increased stock-based compensation, $2.6 million in higher professional fees, and $0.3 million in higher other administrative expenses.
Total Other Income, Net
Total other income, net increased by $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily attributable to increased interest earned on our investments in money market funds and U.S. treasuries.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses and have negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize lorundrostat, seek to identify, assess, acquire, and in-license intellectual property related to or develop additional product candidates and operate as a public company. From inception through the date of this Annual Report, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $498.8 million from the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $198.2 million. In February 2023, we completed our IPO of 13,800,000 shares of our common stock sold at a price to the public of $16.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock, for net proceeds of approximately $201.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering costs. In February 2024, we sold 8,339,169 Shares and, to certain Purchasers, 549,755 Pre-Funded Warrants for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $116.1 million in the Private Placement. 
-99-
Our primary uses of cash to date have been to fund our research and development activities, including with respect to lorundrostat, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
Funding Requirements
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2024 will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operations for at least twelve months. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities; 
•
our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than lorundrostat, and the timing of such development, if any;
•
our ability to receive timely regulatory approvals for lorundrostat, any future product candidates, and additional indications of lorundrostat and any future product candidates, in the jurisdictions in which we or any future partners apply for such approvals;
•
the costs and timing of manufacturing for lorundrostat, or any future product candidate, including commercial manufacture at sufficient scale, if any product candidate is approved, including as a result of inflation, any supply chain issues, or component shortages;
•
any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates and timing of seeking approval in such jurisdictions;
•
the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of lorundrostat or any future product candidates;
•
the costs of obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and protecting our patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; 
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal control over financial reporting; 
•
the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional executive officers and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, and commercial personnel; 
•
the timing and amount of the milestone, royalty, or other payments we must make to Mitsubishi Tanabe, from whom we have in-licensed lorundrostat, or any future licensors; 
•
the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if lorundrostat or any future product candidate is approved; 
•
our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 
-100-
•
patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;
•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements;
•
costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire;

” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from factors that include but are not limited to, geopolitical conflict in and around Ukraine, Israel, and other areas of the world, inflation, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. If we raise additional funds through future collaborations, licenses, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, product candidates, research programs, intellectual property or proprietary technology, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves, or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose.
Cash Flows
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Since our inception, we have primarily used our available cash to fund expenditures related to the in-license and development of lorundrostat. The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years presented (in thousands):

Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $166.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $81.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily attributable to an increase in cash used to support our operating activities, including but not limited to, the development of lorundrostat and related clinical trial expenses, personnel and compensation expense, legal and professional fees to support our operations, and general working capital requirements. The $85.1 million increase in cash used consisted of an increase in net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses, of approximately $102.1 million, and the net effect of changes in working capital of $17.0 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $115.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net cash used of $160.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to the timing and amount of purchases and maturities of marketable securities in each year. During the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase in maturities of prior purchases of $301.0 million and a decrease in purchases of $25.5 million occurred.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $116.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased, compared to $203.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received net proceeds of $116.1 million from the sale of Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants in the Private Placement, and during the year ended December 31, 2023, we received aggregate net proceeds of $203.0 million from the sale of our common stock in our IPO in February 2023.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Under the Mitsubishi License, we have milestone payment obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of specified levels of product sales and are required to make certain royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under the agreement. We are currently unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving other future milestones or making future product sales. See above and Note 4. “
Commitments and Contingencies
” to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Mitsubishi License. 
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business for contract research services, contract manufacturing services, professional services, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We have prepared the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its critical estimates, including those related to prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2. “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our financial statements. 
-102-
Prepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers provide us invoices monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time. We confirm the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated prepaid and accrued research and development expenses include expenses for:
•
CROs in connection with clinical trials;
•
investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing, development, and distribution of clinical materials.
Prepaid and expense accruals related to clinical trials are based on our estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing costs, we estimate the period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period based on patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors on their actual costs incurred. Any estimates of the level of services performed or the costs of these services could differ from actual results.
To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of accrued research and development expenses after a reporting period. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.
Determination of the Fair Value of our Common Stock
Historically for all periods prior to the IPO, since there had been no public market for our common stock, we had been required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards when performing fair value calculations. The fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards was determined on each grant date by our board of directors, taking into consideration input from management and independent third-party valuation analyses. All options to purchase shares of our common stock are intended to be granted with an exercise price per share no less than the fair value per share of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant, based on the information known to us on the date of grant. Prior to obtaining the Mitsubishi License in July 2020, the fair value of our common stock was nominal because we were not sufficiently capitalized and held no assets that could be used to generate future revenues. Subsequent to obtaining the Mitsubishi License, we considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock, including:
•
valuations of our common stock performed with the assistance of independent third-party valuation specialists;
•
our stage of development and business strategy, including the status of research and development efforts of lorundrostat, and the material risks related to our business and industry;
-103-
•
our results of operations and financial position, including our levels of available capital resources;
•
the valuation of publicly-traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies;
•
the lack of marketability of our common stock as a private company;
•
the prices of our convertible preferred stock sold to investors in arm’s length transactions and the rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; and
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common stock, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions.
Prior to the IPO, there were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time estimated to complete an initial public offering or other liquidity event, and the determination of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our net loss and net loss per common share could have been significantly different.
Since the completion of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price as reported on the date of grant by the Nasdaq Global Select Market on which our common stock is traded.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of equity awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (generally the vesting period) on a straight-line basis with forfeitures recognized as they occur. 
We estimate the fair value of option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Estimating the fair value of equity awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of stock options, the expected dividend yield and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. See Note 2. “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” of the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted during 2024 and 2023.
JOBS Act and Smaller Reporting Company Status
As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur 
-104-
if, among other factors, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year (subject to certain conditions), or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have determined that, other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, such standards do not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates of our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and investments. As of December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents and investments consisted of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. The fair value of our short-term cash equivalents and investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. Due to the nature of our cash equivalents and investments, we believe an immediate hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years presented. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located outside the United States and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these arrangements. To date, these fluctuations have not been significant, and we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency. We believe an immediate hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years presented.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development contract costs. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the future due to an impact on the costs to conduct clinical trials, labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and other operational costs. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statements

Note 1. 
Nature of Business
Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone. The Company’s clinical-stage product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, aldosterone synthase inhibitor that the Company is developing for the treatment of cardiorenal conditions affected by dysregulated aldosterone, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. The Company has initiated a pivotal clinical program of lorundrostat for the treatment of uncontrolled or resistant hypertension and a Phase 2 trial for lorundrostat in hypertensive patients with Stage 2 to 3b chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the Company is investigating the benefits of lorundrostat in subjects with hypotension and obstructive sleep apnea. The Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2019, and it is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The Company’s operations to date have been limited to business planning, raising capital, in-licensing, conducting preclinical and clinical trials, and other research and development.
Initial Public Offering
On February 14, 2023, the Company completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 
13,800,000
 shares of its common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 
1,800,000
 additional shares, at a public offering price of $
16.00
 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the IPO were $
201.4
 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering costs.
Reverse Stock Split
On February 1, 2023, the Company effected a one-for-10.798 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value 
$
0.0001
 per share, and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratio of the Company’s preferred stock
 (the Reverse Stock Split). Accordingly, all share and per-share amounts for all years presented in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect this Reverse Stock Split.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since its inception, the Company has not generated any revenue from product sales or other sources and has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Company’s primary uses of cash to date have been to fund research and development activities, business planning, establishing and maintaining the Company’s intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
302.5
 million and cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $
198.2
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $
177.8
 million and net cash used in operating activities of $
166.3
 million.
From inception to December 31, 2024, the Company has funded its operations by raising aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $
498.8
 million from the sale of the Company’s common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. The Company has a limited operating history, and the sales and income potential of its business is unproven. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses in the foreseeable future as a result of the Company’s research and development activities. Additional funding will be required in the future to continue with the Company’s planned research and development and other activities. The Company expects to finance its operations through equity offerings, debt financings, and other capital sources, including potential strategic collaborations, licensing, and other similar arrangements. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2024 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements.

Notes to Financial Statements

Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the years presented. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and Accounting Standards Updates of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Company’s management performed an evaluation of its activities through the date of filing of these financial statements and concluded that there are no subsequent events requiring disclosure, other than as disclosed.
Emerging Growth Company Status 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. The Company may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering or such earlier time as the Company is no longer an “emerging growth company.” Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, its financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. The Company may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering or such earlier time that it is no longer an “emerging growth company.”
Segment Information 
The Company operates in 
one
 operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance, making operating decisions, and allocating Company resources. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is its chief executive officer, who considers net loss to evaluate overall expenses associated with conducting research and development activities, which includes evaluating the progress of ongoing clinical trials and the planning and execution of current and future research and development activities. Further, the CODM reviews and utilizes functional expenses (research and development and general and administrative) as reported in the statements of operations to manage the Company’s operations. Other segment items included in net loss are interest income, net and other income. The measure of performance, significant expenses, and other items are each reflected in the statements of operations. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described below. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheets as total assets. All assets are held in the United States.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates have been used in the following areas, among others: research and development accruals, fair value of the Company’s common stock prior to the closing of the Company’s IPO, and income taxes.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments that have maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did

Concentration of Credit Risk 
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk, such as foreign currency exchange contracts, option contracts, or other hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash balances in several accounts with three financial institutions which, from time to time, are in excess of federally insured limits.

Risks and Uncertainties
The Company has not yet generated any revenue from the sale of its products and is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties that are typically faced by biopharmaceutical companies that devote substantially all of their efforts to research and development and clinical trials and do not yet have commercial products. The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future.
Fair Value Measurements 
The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a hierarchy of inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. 
Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
•
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
•
Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.)
•
Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities)
For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and certain accrued liabilities, the recorded amount approximates estimated fair value due to their relatively short maturity period. Refer to Note 3. “

Investments
The Company generally invests its excess cash in money market funds and investment-grade short- and long-term fixed-income debt securities, such as U.S. Treasury bills. Such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents, current investments, and investments - noncurrent in the balance sheets.
The Company determines the appropriate classification of short-term and long-term securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts using the interest method.
The Company invested in marketable securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and no impairment charges were recorded. For held-to-maturity investments, the Company periodically reviews each individual security position that has an unrealized loss, or impairment, to determine if that impairment is other-than-temporary. If the Company believes an impairment of a security position is other than temporary, based on available quantitative and qualitative information as of the report date, the loss will be recognized within other income, net in the Company’s statements of operations and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Deferred Offering Costs
The Company capitalizes certain legal, professional, accounting, and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity issuances as deferred offering costs until such equity issuances are consummated. After consummation of the equity issuance, these costs are recorded as a reduction in the capitalized amount associated with the equity issuance. Should the equity issuance be abandoned, the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to operating expenses in the statements of operations.
 Deferred offering costs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
0.4
 million and $
0
, respectively. Such costs are classified in other assets on the balance sheets.
Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company records convertible preferred stock at fair value on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs. Upon the occurrence of certain events that are outside the Company’s control, including a deemed liquidation event, holders of the convertible preferred stock can cause redemption for cash. Therefore, the convertible preferred stock is classified outside of stockholders’ deficit on the balance sheets as events triggering the redemption for cash were not solely within the Company’s control. The carrying values of the convertible preferred stock are adjusted to their liquidation preferences if and when it becomes probable that such a liquidation event will occur.
 In February 2023, the Company’s convertible preferred stock converted into shares of the Company’s common stock of which carrying value at the date of conversion was converted to permanent equity, which is described in more detail in Note 6. “
Capital Stock
.”
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs, both internal and external, are expensed as incurred. Costs are considered incurred based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks under each contract using information and data provided to the Company by its clinical sites and vendors. These costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects, as well as fees paid to various entities that perform certain research on behalf of the Company. The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial expenses, consulting and employee-related costs, and costs associated with required regulatory filings, licenses, and fees. 
Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are capitalized and recorded as expense in the period that the Company receives the

goods or when services are performed. Assets acquired (or in-licensed) that are utilized in research and development that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred.
Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and can be reasonably estimated. The Company expects that contingencies related to regulatory approval milestones will only become probable once such regulatory outcome is achieved.
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company’s stock-based awards are subject only to service-based vesting conditions. The Company measures restricted common stock awards using the difference, if any, between the purchase price per share of the award and the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of the grant or modification. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the calculation of expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. 
Volatility
 — Due to the Company’s limited operating history and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar publicly-traded companies. The Company believes that the companies in the group were most representative of the Company and had characteristics similar to its own, including stage of product development, a focus on the life sciences industry, and other economic and industry characteristics. 
Expected Term
 — The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term, as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for options granted, and utilizes the contractual term for options granted. 
Risk-Free Interest Rate 
— The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. 
Expected Dividends 
— To date, the Company has not issued any dividends and does not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore has estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
Subsequent to the closing of the Company’s IPO, the Company determines the fair market value of its common stock using the closing price of its common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Prior to the closing of the Company’s IPO, there was no public market for the Company’s common stock, and the Company determined the fair value of the shares of its common stock underlying its share-based awards by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock, the valuation of comparable companies, the Company’s operating and financial performance, and general and industry-specific economic outlook, among other factors. The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimate, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if the Company had used different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of the Company’s common stock and its stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different. 
Compensation expense related to awards is recognized on a straight-line basis by recognizing the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Management evaluates its award grants and modifications and will adjust the fair value if any are determined to be spring-loaded. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

Defined Contribution Plan 
The Company sponsors a qualified 401(k) plan that allows eligible employees to make contributions, subject to certain limitations. The Company provides a matching contribution of up to 
4
% of an employee’s compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company made matching contributions of $
0.4
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively. 
Net Loss Per Share 
The Company’s basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the year. The diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential common stock equivalents outstanding for the year determined using the treasury stock method. For purposes of this calculation, unvested restricted stock awards and stock options to purchase common stock are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive. The weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic and diluted net loss per common stockholders calculations includes the weighted-average pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period as they are exercisable at any time for nominal cash consideration.

The following table sets forth the potential common shares excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:

Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that some or all of the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based on the technical merits of the tax position, as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company does not have any significant uncertain tax positions. If the Company were to incur interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, it would classify them as income tax expense.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

Notes to Financial Statements

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, including public entities with a single reportable segment, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company adopted this standard for the Company’s fiscal year 2024 annual reporting period.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new standard requires a company to expand its existing income tax disclosures, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The standard is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt the new standard. The new standard is expected to be applied prospectively, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe 
In July 2020, the Company entered into a license agreement (the Mitsubishi License) with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Company (Mitsubishi Tanabe), pursuant to which Mitsubishi Tanabe granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Mitsubishi Tanabe’s patent and other intellectual property rights to exploit products incorporating lorundrostat (formerly MT-4129) (Lorundrostat Products) for the prevention, treatment, diagnosis, detection, monitoring, or predisposition testing with respect to indications, diseases, and conditions in humans. Pursuant to the Mitsubishi License, the Company paid Mitsubishi Tanabe a $
1.0
 million upfront fee and development milestone payments of $
9.0
 million in the aggregate. The Company has remaining obligations to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe commercial milestone payments of up to $
155.0
 million in the aggregate upon first commercial sale and upon meeting certain annual sales targets, as well as additional commercial milestone payments of up to $
10.0
 million for a second indication. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single-digits to ten percent (
10
%) of aggregate net sales of each Lorundrostat Product on a Lorundrostat Product-by-Lorundrostat Product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid Mitsubishi Tanabe patent claim covering a Lorundrostat Product, (ii) 
ten years
 from the first commercial sale of a Lorundrostat Product, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country. Such royalties are subject to reduction under specified conditions, including lack of patent coverage and generic competition.
The Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete the development activities and to file for regulatory approval for at least one Lorundrostat Product in a major market country and consider in good faith developing at least one Lorundrostat Product in a non-major market country. If the Company elects to sublicense its rights under the Mitsubishi License to a third party with respect to exploitation of lorundrostat or any Lorundrostat Product in certain countries in Asia, the Company has agreed to negotiate such a sublicense first, for a specified period of time, with Mitsubishi Tanabe, if Mitsubishi Tanabe notifies the Company that it would like to obtain such a sublicense. The Company also agreed not to commercialize any competing product prior to 
three years
 following the first commercial sale of the first Lorundrostat Product in any country without Mitsubishi Tanabe’s prior consent.
Unless terminated earlier, the Mitsubishi License will continue until the expiration of all of the Company’s royalty obligations to Mitsubishi Tanabe. The Company may terminate the Mitsubishi License for any or no reason upon 
90
 or 
180
 days’ prior written notice to Mitsubishi Tanabe depending on whether the Lorundrostat Product has received regulatory approval. Mitsubishi Tanabe may terminate the Mitsubishi License if the Company has not initiated regulatory consultation for the first global clinical trials of lorundrostat in at least one major market country within a specified amount of time or if the Company or its affiliates or sublicensees initiate a challenge to the patent rights licensed to the Company by Mitsubishi Tanabe. In addition, either party may terminate the Mitsubishi License in the event of an uncured material breach by or bankruptcy of the other party, subject to certain notice and cure periods, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
The Company incurred $
0
 and $
9.0
 million of research and development expenses pursuant to the Mitsubishi License during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that related to the Company’s initiation of its pivotal clinical program of lorundrostat in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the

RSAs granted by the Company have varying vesting terms depending on the terms of the grant. Holders of unvested RSAs have the same rights as those of common stockholders including voting rights and non-forfeitable dividend rights. However, ownership of unvested RSAs cannot be transferred until vested. Upon a participant’s termination of continuous service for any reason, any shares subject to RSAs held by the participant that have not vested as of such termination date may be forfeited to or repurchased by the Company.

2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In February 2023, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders approved the 2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which became effective upon the closing of the Company’s IPO. The ESPP permits eligible employees who elect to participate in an offering under the ESPP to have up to a specified percentage of their eligible compensation withheld, subject to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the ESPP. A total of 
400,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The first ESPP offering period commenced on July 1, 2023, with each new 
six-month
 offering period beginning each January 1 and July 1. ESPP purchases of common stock occur at a price equal to 
85
% of the lower of (i) the closing price on the first trading day of the offering period or (ii) the closing price on the last trading day of the offering period. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
775,722
 shares available for issuance and 
35,617
 cumulative shares had been issued under the ESPP.
In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP will be annually increased on January 1 of each calendar year beginning in 2024 and ending in and including 2033, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the shares outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (ii) such smaller number of shares as is determined by the Company’s board of directors, provided that no more than 
15,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock may be issued under the ESPP.

The Company has established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets, which are dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when, based on all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. When realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to occur, the benefit related to the deductible temporary differences attributable to operations is recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. The Company’s valuation allowance increased by approximately $
48.4
 million and $
18.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $
69.0
 million and $
35.0
 million available to reduce future taxable income, respectively. The federal NOL carryforward has no expiration as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
17.2
 million and $
8.6
 million, respectively, of state NOL carryforwards that begin expiring in 2041.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
15.6
 million and $
5.7
 million, respectively, to reduce future taxable income. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2041. Research and development tax credit carryforwards associated with California carry forward indefinitely. Research and development tax credit carryforwards associated with other states begin expiring in 2038.
The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 382 and 383 limit annual use of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs

Notes to Financial Statements

within a three-year period. The Company completed an ownership change analysis pursuant to IRC Section 382 through December 31, 2024 and determined that the Company experienced ownership changes on February 16, 2021 and June 1, 2022. Since all of the Company’s federal NOLs have an indefinite carryover period, none of the federal NOLs generated prior to the ownership changes will expire prior to utilization, but will be subject to the annual limitations on future utilization. As a result of the annual limitation, approximately $
0.2
 million of federal research and development credits will expire prior to utilization due to the ownership change occurring on February 16, 2021. The remaining federal research and development credits are available to offset federal tax liability within their respective federal research and development credit carryover periods (20 years), subject to the annual limitations on future utilization. State NOLs and state research and development credits may be similarly limited. The Company’s use of federal and state NOLs and research and development credits could be further limited by ownership changes that occur subsequent to December 31, 2024. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future ownership changes, if any, will not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, all years remained subject to examination by tax authorities. 
Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based on new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustment may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more-likely-than-not that it will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
4.5
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively, in unrecognized tax benefits, which would not affect the effective tax rate if recognized due to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

On March 27, 2020, the United States enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The Cares Act is an emergency economic stimulus package that includes spending and tax breaks to strengthen the U.S. economy and fund a nationwide effort to curtail the effect of COVID-19. The CARES Act provides sweeping tax changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the more significant provisions include the removal of certain limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, an increase in the loss carryback period for certain losses to five years, and an increase in the ability to deduct interest expense. Additionally, the CARES Act amends certain provisions of the previously enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Subsequent Events
On February 10, 2025, the board of directors adopted and approved the Company’s 2025 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (the 2025 Inducement Plan), which became effective on February 10, 2025. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules, equity awards under the 2025 Inducement Plan may only be made to an employee if he or she is granted such awards in connection with the commencement of his or her employment with the Company and such grant is a material inducement to his or her entering into employment with the Company.
The Company has reserved 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units under the 2025 Inducement Plan. As of February 12, 2025, no shares had been issued under the 2025 Inducement Plan.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors.
Our auditors will not be required to formally opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information
2025 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan
On February 10, 2025, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Company approved the Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. 2025 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (the 2025 Inducement Plan). The terms of the 2025 Inducement Plan are substantially similar to the terms of the Company’s 2023 Incentive Award Plan with the exception that incentive stock options may not be issued under the 2025 Inducement Plan and awards under the 2025 Inducement Plan may only be issued to eligible recipients under the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. The 2025 Inducement Plan was adopted by the Committee without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
There are initially 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2025 Inducement Plan. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, awards under the 2025 Inducement Plan may only be made to an employee who is commencing employment with the Company or any of its affiliates or who is being rehired following a bona fide interruption of employment by the Company or any of its affiliates, in any case if he or she is granted such award in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company or any of its affiliates and such grant is an inducement material to his or her entering into employment with the Company or any of its affiliates, as applicable.
The foregoing description of the 2025 Inducement Plan is a summary only and does not describe all terms and conditions applicable to the 2025 Inducement Plan. The description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the terms of the 2025 Inducement Plan and the forms of stock option and restricted stock unit agreements, copies of which are filed hereto within exhibit 10.12.
