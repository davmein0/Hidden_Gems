Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Report"), other than purely historical information, including, but not limited to, estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, our anticipated financial resources, our expectations about the future operational performance of our satellites (including their projected operational lives), the expected growth prospects of our existing customers and the markets that we serve, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believe," "might," "could," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. 
Important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, our ability to meet our obligations and attain anticipated benefits under the Updated Services Agreements (as defined herein), the operational performance and orbital lives of our satellites, including damage to or failure of our satellites, disruptions or other problems at our ground facilities, change in our operating plans or corporate strategies, commercial acceptance of and demand for our products and services, our ability to adequately anticipate our satellite capacity needs and maintain sufficient satellite capacity to meet current and increased demand, our ability to exploit and respond to technological innovation, including integration of licensed technology into our products and services and develop, acquire, maintain and protect information and intellectual property rights, our ability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, geopolitical and economic conditions and risks associated with doing business on a global basis, including in developing markets, availability of equipment, component parts and other materials used in our business operations, reliance on key suppliers, our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms, our ability to manage costs, our ability to develop and expand our business (including our ability to maintain, expand and monetize our spectrum rights), compliance with interpretation of and changes in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations), including related to the use of our spectrum, our ability to comply with the restrictive covenants of our financing arrangements and limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, cyber-related attacks and other security breaches, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance coverages, volatility of spectrum values, changes in tax rates and the results of tax examinations, litigation or investigations, regulatory restrictions, liabilities or penalties, reduction of spectrum authority or additional spectrum sharing agreements, revocation, modification or non-renewal of licenses, the opportunities for strategic business combinations and the effects of consolidation in our industry on us and our competitors, the effects of the reverse stock split described in this Report and Nasdaq listing, business interruptions due to natural disasters, unexpected events or public health crises and factors described in
