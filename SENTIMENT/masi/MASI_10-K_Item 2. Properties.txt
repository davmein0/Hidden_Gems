We will continue to utilize third-party contract manufacturers for products and subassemblies that can be more efficiently manufactured by these parties, such as our circuit boards, speakers and certain audio components. We monitor our third-party manufacturers and perform inspections and product tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure compliance with our specifications. We also do full functional testing of our circuit boards. 
For raw materials, we and our contract manufacturers may rely on sole source suppliers for some components. We and our contract manufacturers have taken steps to minimize the impact of a shortage or stoppage of shipments of key components by maintaining a safety stock of component inventory and by redesigning certain products to allow for more universal sub-components. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources. 
We have agreements with certain major suppliers and each agreement provides for varying terms with respect to contract expiration, termination and pricing. Most of these agreements allow for termination upon specified advance notice of various periods to the non-terminating party. Certain of these agreements with our major suppliers allow for pricing adjustments and each agreement provides for annual pricing negotiation.

The majority of our non-healthcare sales are transacted through traditional physical retailers, third party distributors and big box resellers, including on their websites. We also sell through online retailers and custom installers and directly through our individual brand websites.
In the non-healthcare market, we compete with Sonos, Bang & Olufsen, Sony, Samsung (and its subsidiaries), Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and others. Many of our competitors in the non-healthcare consumer market have more broadly diversified product lines, well established supply and distribution systems, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources.
On September 25, 2024, we announced that our Board remains committed to the previously announced review of alternatives for both our consumer audio and consumer healthcare businesses, and that our Board had engaged Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a legal advisor. As of year-end, our non-healthcare consumer audio products business remained part of our continuing operations and as an important part of our broader ecosystem. Subsequently, the sales process has progressed in 2025, and the Sound United business will be classified as held-for-sale and will be reported in discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2025.
Recent Developments
Developments in the RTW Litigation: Masimo Corporation v. Kiani et al
On October 25, 2024, the Company commenced litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Mr. Kiani, Roderick Wong, Naveen Yalamanchi, RTW Investment, LP, RTW Investments GP, LLC, RTW Master Fund, Ltd,. RTW Offshore Fund One, Ltd., RTW Onshore Fund One, LP, RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd,. RTW Innovation Offshore Fund, Ltd,. RTW Innovation Onshore Fund, LP, and RTW Fund Group GP, LLC, seeking disgorgement of short-swing profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (the SDNY Litigation). The Company filed an amended complaint in the SDNY Litigation on December 30, 2024. In the SDNY Litigation, the Company alleges that the defendants formed a stockholder group under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act holding 10% or more of the Company’s common stock and engaged in short-swing trading between May and September 2024 as a part of an empty voting scheme to manipulate the vote in Mr. Kiani’s favor for the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Collectively, the group of defendants formed held as much as 19% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Company alleges that, in coordination with Mr. Kiani, RTW secretly increased its long position in the Company through share purchases in advance of each the two record dates used in the 2024 proxy contest (June 13 and August 12, 2024) to maximize its voting power in favor of Mr. Kiani while offsetting its economic exposure from its increased long position by engaging in short selling. RTW then reduced its long position through share sales and covered its short position after each of the two record dates. Thus for each of the two record dates, RTW artificially and temporarily inflated its voting power to benefit Mr. Kiani. The trading RTW used in this scheme constitutes short-swing trading under Section 16(b) and any profits from such trading within a six-month period must be disgorged to the Company. Under Section 16(b), disgorgeable profits are calculated by matching the highest sales prices within a six month period with the lowest purchase prices, with the goal of identifying the maximum possible disgorgeable profit from the relevant transactions, regardless of any actual profit or loss from trading. Given that RTW, on two separate occasions, increased its holdings from less than 3% to 9.9% of Masimo’s outstanding common stock and reduced its holdings back to less than 3% within a six-month period, the Company believes the total amount of RTW’s disgorgeable profits could be substantial.
Investigation Into Mr. Kiani’s Use of Aircraft Reimbursement
The Company is currently investigating any non-reimbursement or under-reimbursement by Mr. Kiani under the aircraft time
share agreement with Mr. Kiani. Based on the Company’s subsequent review of records, it is unclear whether Mr. Kiani reimbursed all or any portion of the amounts charged to him or if Mr. Kiani was charged in a manner consistent with the terms of the aircraft time share agreement.
