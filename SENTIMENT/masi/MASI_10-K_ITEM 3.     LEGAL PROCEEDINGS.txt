Executive Overview
We are a global technology company dedicated to improving lives. We aim to accelerate our growth strategies by continuously innovating and prioritizing patient care with a lens toward value-creation initiatives, including our Board of Directors’ (Board) commitment to a strategic review of all business activities.
Healthcare
Our healthcare business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies, hospital automation
®
 and connectivity solutions, remote monitoring devices and consumer health products. Our healthcare products and patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor or circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable sensors, software, cables and other services. We primarily sell our healthcare products to hospitals, emergency medical service (EMS) providers, home care providers, physician offices, veterinarians, long-term care facilities and consumers through our direct sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, such as GE Healthcare, Hillrom, Mindray, Philips, Physio-Control, Zoll, among others.

While we seek to increase sales through our direct-to-consumer sales channel, we expect that our partnerships with third-party retailers and custom installers will continue to be an important part of our ecosystem. We will continue to seek retail partners that can deliver differentiated in-store experiences to support customer demand for product demonstrations. Our physical retail distribution relies on third-party retailers and our ability to maintain our efficiency in our manufacturing processes.
Outlook and Strategy
We are excited about the long-term prospects of patient care, hospital automation
®
 and advancing our initiatives of making hospital quality patient monitoring available in the home and for home wellness needs. Healthcare ecosystems are rapidly evolving and becoming visibly more interconnected. Accelerated by the need to adapt to the post-pandemic world, more patient care is moving closer to the home. The widespread caregiver shortage demands transformative changes in the current healthcare space. Patients continue to gravitate toward products that can extend the reach of physicians without any compromise on the quality of care after a hospital visit or discharge.
We continue to seek out differentiated growth opportunities to cross-leverage technologies, bringing our core clinically superior solutions into the home and continue to advance our integration technologies into the hospital to advance hospital automation
®
 connectivity and cloud-based technologies.

Economic Trends and Developments Affecting Our Business
The healthcare and non-healthcare markets we operate in are highly competitive and dynamic, and experienced a number of headwinds in 2023 and 2024, including but not limited to supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, interest rates volatility, rising energy costs, transportation shortages, recessionary trends and foreign currency fluctuations. All of these have affected the global economic environment, along with the healthcare facility spending trends and consumer spending behaviors which ultimately affected our performance. While we experienced volatility in both our healthcare and non-healthcare segments, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term growth and prospects.
During 2023, we initiated various cost reduction actions to better optimize our cost structure with near-term revenue to enhance our operating cash flow, and improve our profitability for both segments going forward. Our initial focus was on a reduction of variable costs, with specific attention to eliminating cost inefficiencies in our supply chain and reducing variable labor spend and overhead costs in our production facilities by shifting manufacturing of certain products to lower cost locations. Through the second and third quarters of 2023, we expanded these actions by streamlining operations, including the consolidation and rationalization of business activities and facilities, workforce reductions, suspension of incentive bonus compensation and annual salary adjustments, transfers of product lines between manufacturing facilities, and the transfer of other business activities between facilities.
At the same time, we also revisited our revenue forecasts to reflect the current lower than expected U.S. hospital inpatient census, elevated sensor inventory levels at some customers due to discounting in prior quarters, and other factors that negatively affected revenues. Specifically, during fiscal year 2022 and into the early part of the second quarter of 2023, we sold products at a discount which led to elevated inventory levels at customers and delayed reordering for our single-patient use sensors and consumables and which, along with other factors, negatively impacted our business in the second quarter of 2023 and to a lesser extent in subsequent quarters.
During the fourth quarter 2024, we implemented a strategic realignment initiative to refocus on profitability, maximizing our return on invested capital, and driving stronger returns for our stockholders. 
Seasonality
Each of our business segments is individually influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, holiday schedules, hospital census, clinicians, nurses and hospital personnel, the timing of the influenza season, holiday seasons, consumer pressures, fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary and recessionary pressures, consumer demand and preferences, competitors’ marketing promotions and sales incentives; among many other factors.
Our healthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality of the U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer elective procedures utilizing our healthcare products.
Our non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year historically produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other quarters of our fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. Our promotional discounting activity may negatively impact our gross margin during the holiday periods and into the trailing period (depending on our annual 52/53 week fiscal year end calendar).
Contract Conversions and Installations
During the second quarter and continuing into the third and fourth quarters of 2023, we achieved substantial market share gains through contract acquisitions as new hospital customers continued to switch to Masimo technology at rapid rates. However, conversions of new customers who have contracted to switch to Masimo were less than expected due to continued labor shortages in hospitals and our OEM partners not being able to provide the patient monitoring equipment needed to complete the installations in a timely manner; thereby impacting our second, third and fourth quarter 2023 healthcare revenues. The installation challenges we experienced in fiscal 2023 increased our backlog systems installations into fiscal 2024 and is expected to carry over into fiscal 2025.
Despite these obstacles, we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to address the labor shortages, including engaging additional third-party installation service providers. Our hospital business continued to be strong, as our growth in contracting reflects. We remain confident that sensor utilization and sensor revenue growth rates will return to normal levels.

Ongoing Russian-Ukraine Conflict and Israel-Palestine-Iran War
We continue to monitor the uncertainty from conflicts and wars in Russia, the Ukraine and Israel, with respect to on-going business in such regions, and are continuing to support existing patient populations while remaining compliant with all applicable U.S. and EU sanctions and regulations, where applicable. While none of Russia, the Ukraine or Israel constitutes a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the current scope of the conflicts in either geographic region, including the Middle East, could have an impact on our business. In the interim, order acceptance for Russia has been halted. For the three and twelve months ended December 28, 2024 sales derived from customers based in Russia represented an immaterial percentage of our total revenue.
Executive Leadership and Board Transitions
At our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 19, 2024, our stockholders voted to elect William Jellison and Darlene Solomon to our Board, the voting results of which were certified by the independent inspector of election on September 24, 2024. On September 19, 2024, Joe Kiani, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, delivered a notice to our Board stating his decision to resign from his position as our CEO. On September 24, 2024, our Board appointed director Michelle Brennan to serve as our interim CEO, effective September 24, 2024, and the Board retained Korn Ferry to assist with CEO succession planning.
On October 16, 2024, our Board increased the authorized number of directors on our Board to eight and, in connection with such increase, appointed Timothy J. Scannell and Wendy E. Lane as Class III directors of Masimo, effective October 16, 2024.
On October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment, effective October 24, 2024.
On January 21, 2025, the Company announced that the Board has appointed Catherine Szyman, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective as of February 12, 2025 (the “Effective Date”). As of the Effective Date, Michelle Brennan will cease to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, a role that she has held since September 24, 2024. Ms. Brennan will continue to serve as member of the Board, and has been appointed to the role of Chairman of the Board while Mr. Koffey will serve in the role of Vice-Chairman of the Board.
In connection with Ms. Szyman’s appointment as CEO, the Board increased the authorized number of directors on the Board to nine and appointed Ms. Szyman to fill such vacancy created by the increase in directors, in each case effective as of the Effective Date. Ms. Szyman will serve as a Class II director until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which the Class II directors are elected, until her successor is duly elected and has qualified, or until her earlier death, resignation or removal.
On February 12, 2025, changes were made to our management and Board, including the following: (a) Ms. Szyman became our new CEO and joined the Board as a Class II director; (b) Ms. Brennan stepped down from her position as Interim CEO and became the Chairman of the Board: and (c) Mr. Koffey stepped down from his position as Lead Independent Director and became Vice-chairman of the Board.
Executive Management Transitions
On November 13, 2024, in connection with its strategic shift to refocus on its core healthcare business, the Company terminated the employment of Tao Levy, the Company’s EVP, Business Development.
On February 6, 2025, the Company terminated the employment of Tom McClenahan, the Company’s EVP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, effective as of February 6, 2025.
Strategic Realignment Initiative
During the fourth quarter of 2024, our Board approved a strategic realignment initiative of our healthcare segment to drive progress towards a more streamlined and efficient organization, which included right-sizing the organization, cost rationalization, driving research and development efficiencies and enhancing key launch and innovation processes. The impact of the strategic realignment initiative resulted in charges of approximately $128.0 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024, which have been reflected in cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue for our healthcare segment increased 9.4%, or $119.7 million to $1,395.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2024, compared to $1,275.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2023. This increase was driven by continued growth in hospital contracting both inside and outside the U.S. as well as a return to normal hospital ordering patterns after a weak prior year. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by approximately $4.9 million of foreign exchange rate movements from the prior year period that increased the U.S. Dollar translation of foreign sales that were denominated in various foreign currencies. 
Revenue generated through our direct and distribution sales channels increased $120.6 million, or 10.6%, to $1,263.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2024, compared to $1,143.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2023. Revenues from our OEM channel increased $1.1 million, or 0.8%, to $131.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2024, as compared to $130.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2023.

Gross profit increased $0.9 million to $1,004.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2024, from $1,003.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes from our healthcare segment, which were primarily offset by decreased sales volumes from our non-healthcare segment and various charges for certain products that were earmarked “end of life” or included in the strategic realignment initiative, which are no longer going to be supported or expected to be brought to market. These inventory related charges also had a negative impact our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, which decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 28, 2024, from 49.0% for the year ended December 30, 2023.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment analysis and, based on this assessment, we determined that the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks and goodwill in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $304.0 million. For indefinite-lived intangibles, the fair values were estimated using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, which involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.

For the non-healthcare reporting unit, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of 2024. We used a combination of both an income and a market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market approach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach to calculate projected future discounted cash flows included revenue growth rates, operating margins and a discount rate for the reporting unit. The discount rate was determined using a weighted average cost of capital for risk factors specific to the reporting unit and other market and industry data. For our non-healthcare reporting unit, goodwill was fully impaired such that the impairment expense was approximately $294.0 million.
We review goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of the year or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment, and should our stock price, macro-economic market conditions or related forecast revisions market conditions continue to deteriorate, the result of such review may indicate additional declines in the fair value of goodwill or intangible assets, requiring additional impairment charges in the future. For goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.
We performed a qualitative assessment for our healthcare reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2024. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required on this reporting unit.
During the third quarter of 2023, we experienced declines in our stock price and certain worsening macro-economic market conditions, which contributed to a significant decline in our market capitalization. Based on these factors, we determined that there was a triggering event for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which required an interim impairment assessment. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and a recoverability test for other long lived assets with finite lives. This quantitative assessment indicated that the carrying value of certain trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $7.0 million. In conjunction with this third quarter interim impairment quantitative assessment, we concluded that both the healthcare reporting unit’s and non-healthcare reporting unit’s respective estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. Furthermore, recoverability tests performed for other long-lived assets with finite lives indicated no recoverability issues.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment analysis and, based on this assessment, we determined the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $3.0 million. For indefinite-lived intangibles, the fair values were estimated using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, which involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. For certain of these intangibles, the discount rate assumed in the analysis was 15.0%, and a 1.0% change would equate to approximately $12.0 million in fair value, all other variables remaining constant.
Non-operating Loss
. Non-operating loss consists primarily of interest income, interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses. Non-operating loss for the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was as follows:

Our (benefit) provision for income taxes was $(0.4) million for the year ended December 28, 2024 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 0.1% for the year ended December 28, 2024 compared to 7.5% for the year ended December 30, 2023. This decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2024 resulted primarily from an increase in a non-deductible goodwill impairment, partially offset by a decrease in income tax credits from the year ended December 30, 2023.
We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on approximately $911 million in accumulated earnings from our foreign subsidiaries as we expect that such amounts will continue to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Our actual future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors, including the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of excess tax benefits realized from U.S. stock-based compensation, the amount of our research and development tax credits, the deductibility of executive compensation, changes in tax laws, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and the recognition and derecognition of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions.
Comparison of the Year ended December 28, 2024 to the Year ended December 30, 2023
For a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 28, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 30, 2023, refer to the discussion under the heading “Comparison of the Year ended December 28, 2024 to the Year ended December 30, 2023” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with Item 7, in each case, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Prospective Capital Requirements
Our principal sources of liquidity consist of our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, future funds expected to be generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $608.1 million in working capital, of which approximately $177.6 million was in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to net working capital, we had approximately $245.5 million of available borrowing capacity (net of outstanding letters of credit) under our Credit Revolving Facility as compared to approximately $668.1 million in working capital and approximately $163.0 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 30, 2023.
We currently maintain a Credit Revolving Facility, which provides for $705.0 million of unsecured borrowings. The Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. Proceeds from the Credit Facility are being used for general corporate, capital investment and expenditures and working capital needs. For further information see Note 15, “Debt”, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In managing our day-to-day liquidity and capital structure, we generally do not rely on foreign earnings as a source of funds. As of December 28, 2024, we had cash totaling $78.2 million held outside of the U.S., of which approximately $28.6 million was accessible without additional tax cost and approximately $49.6 million was accessible at an incremental estimated tax cost of up to $0.3 million. We currently have sufficient domestic funds on-hand and cash held outside the U.S. that is available without additional tax cost to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds that are treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, we may be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, market acceptance of our technologies, our continued ability to commercialize new products and to create or improve our technologies and applications, expansion of our global footprint through acquisitions and/or strategic investments in technologies or technology companies, hedging and derivative activities, investments in property and equipment, the renewal of our Credit Facility, the impact of disruptions to the manufacturing industry supply chain for key components, inflation, repurchases of our stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, costs related to our domestic and international regulatory requirements and other long-term commitment and contingencies. For further information see Note 24,“Commitments and Contingencies” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents
Our total cash and cash equivalents and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions may include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facility and cash provided by operations and, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other operational funding needs for the next 12 months.
Should we require additional funds in the future to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes, we may seek to raise such additional funds through debt financing, as well as from other sources such as through our effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-262770) on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable when required.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and form the basis for making management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these estimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on the consolidated financial statements may be material. We believe that the critical accounting policies that are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
Revenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Other Contract Liabilities
We derive the majority of our revenue from four primary sources: (i) direct sales under deferred equipment agreements with end-user hospitals where we provide up-front monitoring equipment at no up-front charge in exchange for a multi-year sensor purchase commitment; (ii) other direct sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other direct customers; (iii) sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to distributors who then typically resell to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other customers; and (iv) sales of integrated circuit boards to OEM customers who incorporate our embedded software technology into their multiparameter monitoring devices. Subject to customer credit considerations, the majority of such sales are made on open account using industry standard payment terms based on the geography within which the specific customer is located.
We generally recognize revenue following a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers and generally provide for the recognition of revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of allowances for estimated returns, discounts or sales incentives, as well as taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities, when control over the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue related to equipment supplied under sales-type lease arrangements is recognized once control over the equipment is transferred to the customer, while revenue related to equipment supplied under operating-type lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
While the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some transactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. As a result, contract interpretation and analysis is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including: (i) the amount of the total consideration, including variable consideration, (ii) whether the arrangement contains an embedded lease, and if so, whether such embedded lease is a sales-type lease or an operating lease, (iii) the identification of the distinct performance obligations contained within the arrangement, (iv) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each performance obligation when multiple performance obligations exist, including the determination of standalone selling price, and (v) when to recognize revenue on the performance obligations. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition.
76
Table of Contents
We enter into agreements to sell our monitoring solutions and services, sometimes as part of arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include various combinations of distinct product sales, equipment leases and services. In the case of contracts with multiple performance obligations, the authoritative guidance provides that the total consideration be allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling prices. When a standalone selling price is not readily observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the product, geographies, type of customer, contractual prices pursuant to Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) contracts, our pricing and discount practices, and other market conditions.
Sales under deferred equipment agreements are generally structured such that we agree to provide certain monitoring-related equipment, software, installation, training and/or warranty support at no up-front charge in exchange for the customer’s commitment to purchase sensors over the term of the agreement, which generally ranges from three to six years. We allocate contract consideration under deferred equipment agreements containing fixed annual sensor purchase commitments to the underlying lease and non-lease components at contract inception. In determining whether any underlying lease components are related to a sales-type lease or an operating lease, we evaluate the customer’s rights and ability to control the use of the underlying equipment throughout the contract term, including any equipment substitution rights retained by us, as well as our expectations surrounding potential contract/lease extensions or renewals and the customer’s likelihood to exercise any purchase options. Revenue allocable to non-lease components is generally recognized as such non-lease components are satisfied. Revenue allocable to lease components under sales-type lease arrangements is generally recognized when control over the equipment is transferred to the customer. Revenue allocable to lease components under operating lease arrangements is generally recognized over the term of the operating lease. We generally do not expect to derive any significant value in excess of such asset’s unamortized book value from equipment underlying our operating leases arrangements.
Revenue from direct sales of our products to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations, other direct customers, distributors and OEM customers is generally recognized by us when control of such products transfer to the customer based upon the terms of the contract or underlying purchase order. Revenue related to OEM rainbow
®
 parameter software licenses is recognized by us upon the OEM’s shipment of its product to its customer, as reported to us by the OEM.
We provide certain customers with various sales incentives that may take the form of discounts or rebates. We estimate and provide allowances for these programs as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. In general, customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund. However, we allow returns under certain circumstances. At the end of each period, we estimate and accrue for these returns as a reduction to revenue. We estimate the revenue constraints related to these forms of variable consideration based on various factors, including expected purchasing volumes, prior sales and returns history, and specific contractual terms and limitations.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates first-in, first-out method and includes material, labor and overhead costs. Inventory valuation reserves are recorded for materials that have become excess or obsolete or are no longer used in current production and for inventory items that have a market price less than the carrying value in inventory. We generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used within one year. However, changes in operating strategy and customer demand, and frequent unpredictable fluctuations in market values for such materials, can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit. We regularly monitor potential inventory excess, obsolescence and lower market values compared to standard costs and, when necessary, reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value.
We determine any required inventory valuation adjustments based on an evaluation of the expected future use of our inventory on an item by item basis. We apply historical obsolescence rates to estimate the loss on inventory expected to have a recovery value below cost. Our historical obsolescence rates are developed from our company specific experience for major categories of inventory, which are then applied to excess inventory on an item by item basis. We also record other specific inventory valuation adjustments when we become aware of other unique events that result in a known recovery value below cost. For inventory items that have been written down, the reduced value becomes the new cost basis. If our assumptions, judgments or estimates for potential inventory losses prove to be too low, our future earnings will be affected when any related additional inventory losses are recorded.

Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. In assessing goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We have two reporting units, healthcare and non-healthcare. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill considers various macro-economic, industry-specific and Company-specific factors, including: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant Company-specific actions; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below its net book value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative analysis, then we perform a quantitative analysis that compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired; otherwise, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the lesser of: (a) the amount that the carrying amount of such reporting unit exceeds its fair value; or (b) the amount of the goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue forecast projections, expected growth rates, future product launches and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in determining our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment testing, unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing, if impairment indicators exist. Impairment for indefinite-lived assets exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets if necessary for impairment testing require significant judgment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors.
We review finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Determining the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue forecast projections, expected growth rates, future product launches and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows and the future market value of our asset group. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in determining our asset group. We base our recoverability estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation awards are currently comprised of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), all of which are equity-classified awards. For equity-classified awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, we estimate the fair value of the award on the date of grant and expense stock-based compensation over the requisite service period. In the case of PSUs, the amount of expense recognized is also dependent upon the expected achievement level for the specified performance criteria. The fair value of RSU and PSU awards is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. To calculate the fair value of stock option awards, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which, in addition to the closing price of our stock on the grant date and the option strike price, requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (the expected term), the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the dividend yield on our common stock. We estimate expected term based on both our specific historical option exercise experience, as well as expected term information available from a peer group of companies with similar vesting schedules. The estimated volatility is based on both the historical and implied volatilities of our share price.

Changes in the types and quantity of equity awards, as well as the fair market value of our stock may impact the cost of future stock option grants. In general, to the extent that the fair market value of our stock increases, the overall cost of granting these options will also increas

Stock-Based Compensation”
 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements i
ncluded in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A tax position that meets a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is recognized in the first reporting period that it becomes more-likely-than-not such tax position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period. Differences between actual results and our assumptions, or changes in our assumptions in future periods, are recorded in the period they become known. We record potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a
 result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court rulings. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2018 and all material state, local and foreign income tax matters for years through 2015. Given the foreg
oing, our actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets (DTA) and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that all or part of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial performance, scheduled reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, availability of taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies. 
Income taxes are highly susceptible to changes from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of our DTAs and the impact of changes in valuation allowances. Any difference in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could results in changes to our results of operations.
Litigation Costs and Contingencies
We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of whether a loss contingency or litigation settlement is probable or reasonably possible involves a significant amount of management judgment, as does the estimation of the range of loss given the nature of contingencies. Liabilities related to litigation settlements with multiple elements are recorded based on the fair value of each element. Legal and other litigation related expenses are recognized as the services are provided. We record insurance and other indemnity recoveries for litigation expenses when both of the following conditions are met: (i) the recovery is probable and (ii) collectability is reasonably assured. The insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements; however, it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot provide assurance that any actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or substantial settlement charges. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are exposed to various market risks that may arise from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation. We do maintain a derivative instrument for cash flow hedging, but do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our cash and cash equivalents and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments. As of December 28, 2024, the carrying value of our cash equivalents approximated fair value. We manage our risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to interest expenses under our Credit Facility by engaging in hedging activities. Since July 2022, we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows associated with our outstanding debt with variable interest rates. The interest rate swap contracts have maturities averaging five years or less. See Note 17, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase or decrease our interest rate yields on our investments, interest income and Credit Facility by approximately $0.1 million for each $10.0 million in interest-bearing investments and by $0.1 million for each additional $10.0 million of debt.
Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $1.0 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, for the quarter ended December 28, 2024 and approximately $0.4 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts for the year ended December 28, 2024.
We sponsor multiple defined benefit pension plans covering certain international employees. The aggregate fair value of the plans’ investments was $22.8 million as of December 28, 2024. The plans’ assets may be subject to market risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, which may affect the value of the plans’ assets and the funding of the plans.
Increases in interest rates globally may impact the value of pension plan assets held by us. When interest rates increase, the value of fixed income securities, such as bonds, may decrease, which can negatively impact the fair value of the pension plan assets. However, interest rate increases may also improve the funded status of plan by increasing the discount rate used to measure the present value of the pension obligations and potentially decreasing our requirement to make contributions to the plan. The most significant actuarial assumption affecting pension expense and pension obligations is discount rates. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis point in discount rates would result in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in the projected benefit obligation. The impact of interest rate increases on the pension plan assets and funded status may not be predictable and may vary from period to period.
See Notes 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and 21, “Employee Benefits” 
to our accompanying consolidated financial statements i
ncluded in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. for further discussion of these assets.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
A majority of our assets and liabilities are maintained in the United States in U.S. Dollars and a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in U.S. Dollars. However, we also transact with foreign customers in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on average exchange rates during a respective period. In addition, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in their respective country’s local currency, which is also their functional currency. As a result, expenses of these foreign subsidiaries, when converted into U.S. Dollars can also vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period. 
We are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as our foreign currency denominated cash balances and certain intercompany transactions. In addition, other transactions between us or our subsidiaries and a third-party, denominated in a currency different from the functional currency, are foreign currency transactions. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these transactions are also included in our statements of operations as incurred.
80
Table of Contents
The balance sheets of each of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average monthly exchange rates applicable during the period. Any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposures are primarily with the Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Swedish Krona, the British Pound, Mexican Peso, Turkish Lira, Australian Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Foreign currency exchange rates may experience significant volatility from one period to the next.
We do not use derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The effect of additional changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows, depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and depending on the directional change (either a 
strengthening or weakening against the U.S. Dollar). We estimate that the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all applicable foreign currency exchange rates from the rates in effect as of December 28, 2024 would have resulted in an estimated reduction of $47.5 million in reported pre-tax income for the year ended December 28, 2024. As our foreign operations continue to grow, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant.
Inflation Risk
We believe that inflationary pressures on commodity prices, labor costs, and transportation directly impacted our business segments during the year ended 2024, in particular, our consumer products and non-healthcare business segment. Though we believe that the easing of interest rates throughout 2024 had a positive impact on the return of consumer discretionary spending, any inherent volatility could have a significant material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. We are unable to estimate or determine the exact impact of inflation on our global business, financial condition or results of operations during the periods presented.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2024.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Masimo Corporation
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Masimo Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Change in accounting principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted new accounting guidance in 2024 related to the disclosure of segment information in accordance with ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The adoption was retrospectively applied to 2023 and 2022.
Basis for opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter 
The critical audit matter

communicated below is a

matter

arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates

to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter

below, providing a

separate opinion

on the critical audit matter

or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Impairment assessment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets – non-healthcare segment
As described further in Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill might be impaired. In addition, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment for both its non-healthcare indefinite-lived intangible assets and its non-healthcare reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2024 as part of its annual impairment assessment. The Company also assessed the recoverability of the non-healthcare segment’s long-lived assets. We identified certain significant assumptions within the valuations performed to determine the fair value of both the non-healthcare indefinite-lived intangible assets and the

non-healthcare reporting unit and the assessment of the recoverability of the non-healthcare long-lived assets as a critical audit matter.
The principal considerations for our determination that certain significant assumptions within the valuations performed to determine the fair value of both the non-healthcare indefinite-lived intangible assets and the non-healthcare reporting unit and the assessment of the recoverability of the non-healthcare long-lived assets is a critical audit matter are that the determination of the fair values and probability weighted recoverability test of such assets required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate used, forecasted revenues, and scenario probabilities, including the potential separation of Sound United scenario. This required a high degree of auditor judgment, including professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, in auditing these assumptions made by management.
Our audit procedures related to certain significant assumptions within the valuations performed to determine the fair value of both the non-healthcare indefinite-lived intangible assets and the non-healthcare reporting unit and the assessment of the recoverability of the non-healthcare long-lived assets included the following, among others. 
•
We tested the probability scenarios used in the probability weighted recoverability test through corroborative inquiry and inspection of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions.
•
We assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies utilized and the discount rate selected by management with the assistance of our valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
•
We tested the forecasted revenues by assessing the reasonableness of management’s forecast compared to historical results and forecasted market and industry trends.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Masimo Corporation
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Masimo Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024, and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of the Company 
Masimo Corporation (the “Company”) is a global technology company that develops, manufactures and markets a wide array of patient monitoring technologies, as well as automation and connectivity solutions. The Company’s mission is to improve patient outcomes, reduce the cost of care and take noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications. The Company operates 
two
 reportable segments: healthcare and non-healthcare.
The Company’s healthcare products and patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor or circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable sensors, software and/or cables. The Company primarily sells its products to hospitals, emergency medical service providers, home care providers, physician offices, veterinarians, long-term care facilities and consumers through its direct sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners.
On April 11, 2022, the Company acquired Viper Holdings Corporation, the parent company of DEI Sales, Inc., d/b/a Sound United (Sound United), via the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Boom Acquisition Corp (Sonic) (Sound United acquisition). For additional information on Masimo’s acquisition of Sound United, see Note 18, “Business Combinations”. 
The Company’s non-healthcare consumer products and home integration technologies are primarily sold or licensed direct-to-consumers, or through authorized retailers and wholesalers.
In addition, the Company updated its financial reporting segments to align with the way it manages its business units post-acquisition. See Note 25, “Segment and Enterprise Reporting”, for additional details.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, our Board approved a strategic realignment initiative of the Company’s healthcare segment to drive progress towards a more streamlined and efficient organization, which included right-sizing the organization, cost rationalization, driving research and development efficiencies and enhancing key launch and innovation processes. The impact of the strategic realignment initiative resulted in charges of approximately $
128.0
 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024, which have been reflected as cost of goods sold for approximately $
61.0
 million, as selling, general and administrative expenses for approximately $
31.0
 million, and as research and development for approximately $
36.0
 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Included in these charges were accrued severance for workforce reductions, of which approximately $
4.3
 million was accrued as of December 28, 2024.
The terms “the Company” and “Masimo” refer to Masimo Corporation and, where applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Periods
The Company follows a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year. Under a conventional 52/53 week fiscal year, a 52 week fiscal year includes four quarters of 13 weeks while a 53 week fiscal year includes three 13 week fiscal quarters and one 14 week fiscal quarter. The Company’s last 53 week fiscal year was fiscal year 2020. Fiscal year 2024 was a 52 week fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. The Company’s next 53 week year will be fiscal year 2025. All references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements are fiscal years unless otherwise noted.
Reclassifications
Certain
 amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including certain balance sheet asset accounts in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
There was no impact on previously reported total assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity or net income.

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Use of Estimates
The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include the determination of standalone selling prices, variable consideration, total consideration allocated to each performance obligation within a contract, inventory valuation, valuation of the Company’s equity awards, valuation of identifiable assets and liabilities connected with business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; derivative and equity instruments, deferred taxes and any associated valuation allowances, deferred revenue, accounting for pensions, uncertain income tax positions, litigation costs, and related accruals.
 See Note 24
, “Commitments and Contingencies” for further details. Actual results could differ from such estimates.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
, which requires that once control is obtained, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, if applicable, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with the exception of acquired contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) from contracts with customers. These are recognized and measured in accordance with 
ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, if applicable, is recorded as goodwill.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company accounts for certain financial instruments at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments using the framework prescribed by ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, and considers the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and the Company’s creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, the Company may utilize financial models to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. In doing so, the Company uses inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement
On a recurring basis, the Company measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, the Company applies valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Authoritative guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:
●    
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for 
identical
 assets or liabilities.
●    
Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for 
similar
 assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
●    
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

______________
(1)     
Due to the timing of a cash transfer, there was a payable as of December 30, 2023, resulting in a negative allocation as of year end.
(2)    
Includes accrued interest.
The Company invests in checking, savings and money market fund accounts, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices. These investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents within the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and its accounting policies.
The Company’s marketable equity securities, 
whose price is based on quoted market price in an active market, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Equity securities are classified as current, short-term investments, or non-current, recorded in other non-current assets, based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. 
The changes in the fair value of those equity securities are measured at each reporting date and changes in the value of these investments between reporting dates are recorded within 
non-operating income (loss)
.
The Company’s pension assets consist of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. The fair values of Level 2 assets are based on observable inputs such as prices or quotes for similar assets, adjusted for any differences in terms or conditions that may affect the value of the instrument being valued. The valuation techniques used for Level 2 assets may include the use of models or other valuation techniques, but these methods are all based on observable market inputs.
The Company also has investments in certain derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
For certain other financial assets and liabilities, including restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value primarily due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. The Company also measures certain non-financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment.
F-13
Table of Contents
MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Furtherm
ore, the Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to specific assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less, or highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, to be cash equivalents. The Company carries cash and cash equivalents at cost, which approximates fair value, and they are Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable consist of trade receivables recorded at the time of invoicing of product sales, reduced by reserves for estimated bad debts and returns. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Collateral is generally not required. The Company records an allowance for credit losses that it does not expect to collect based on relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes they are uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Based on the risk characteristics, the Company has identified U.S. and international customers as separate portfolios for both segments, and measures expected credit losses on such receivables using an aging methodology.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates the first in, first out method, and includes material, labor and overhead costs. Inventory valuation adjustments are recorded for inventory items that have become excess or obsolete or are no longer used in current production and for inventory items that have a market price less than the carrying value in inventory. The Company generally determines inventory valuation adjustments based on an evaluation of the expected future use of its inventory on an item by item basis and applies historical obsolescence rates to estimate the loss on inventory expected to have a recovery value below cost. The Company also records other specific inventory valuation adjustments when it becomes aware of unique events or circumstances that result in an expected recovery value below cost. For inventory items that have been written down, the reduced value becomes the new cost basis.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:
Useful Lives
Buildings and building improvements
7
 to 
39
 years
Computer equipment and software
2
 to 
12
 years
Demonstration units
2
 to 
3
 years
Furniture and office equipment
2
 to 
15
 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of useful life or term of lease
Machinery, equipment and tooling
3
 to 
20
 years
Operating lease assets
Lesser of useful life or term of lease
Transportation, vehicles and other
1
 to 
20
 years
Land is not depreciated and construction-in-progress is not depreciated until placed in service. Normal repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, whereas significant improvements that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the related assets. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss on the sale or retirement is recognized in income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Lessee Right-of-Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an asset underlying an operating lease for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from an operating lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally estimates the applicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the lease commencement date. Many of the Company’s lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which the Company does not include in its lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and liabilities associated with certain equipment leases.
The Company has also made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases and to exclude short-term leases with a term of twelve months or less from its ROU assets and lease liabilities. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, trademarks, software development costs, customer relationships and acquired technology. Costs related to patents and trademarks, which include legal and application fees, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Patent and trademark amortization commences once final approval of the patent or trademark has been obtained. Patent costs are amortized over the lesser of 
10
 years or the patent’s remaining legal life, which assumes renewals, and trademark costs are amortized over 
17
 years, and their associated amortization cost is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For intangibles purchased in an asset acquisition or business combination, which mainly include patents, trademarks, customer relationships and acquired technologies, the useful life is determined largely by valuation estimates of remaining economic life.
The Company’s policy is to renew its patents and trademarks. Costs to renew patents and trademarks are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset. The Company periodically evaluates the amortization period and carrying basis of patents and trademarks to determine whether any events or circumstances warrant a revised estimated useful life or reduction in value. Capitalized application costs are charged to operations when it is determined that the patent or trademark will not be obtained or is abandoned.
Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, 
Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. 
Once technological feasibility has been established, qualifying costs incurred in development are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value.
Intangibles purchased as part of an asset acquisition or business combination historically have included patents, trademarks, customer relationships, developed technologies and contractual licenses. In certain circumstances, the Company has also acquired non-compete agreements tied to certain employment relationships. The useful life for all of these is largely determined by valuation estimates of remaining economic life. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, the Company acquired certain trademarks/tradenames, which are intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. These brands are expected to maintain brand value for an indefinite period of time.

Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. In assessing goodwill impairment, the Company has the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company has 
two
 reporting units, healthcare and non-healthcare. The Company’s qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill considers various macro-economic, industry-specific and Company-specific factors, including: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant Company-specific actions; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of the Company’s financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in the Company’s market capitalization below its net book value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, then the Company performs a quantitative analysis that compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired; otherwise, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the lesser of: (a) the amount that the carrying amount of such reporting unit exceeds its fair value; or (b) the amount of the goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Similar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment testing, unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing, if impairment indicators exist. Impairment for indefinite-lived assets exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets if necessary for impairment testing require significant judgment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors.
The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Employee Defined Benefit Plans
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit plans that cover certain employees in certain international locations. The Company recognizes the funded status, or the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the difference or underfunded status represents the pension liability. The Company records a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations. The liabilities and annual income or expense are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. The Company’s accounting policy includes an annual re-measurement of pension assets and obligations. In addition, the Company r
e-measures pension assets and obligations for significant events, as of the nearest month-end date on the calendar.
 The fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices. See Note 21, “Employee Benefits”, for further details.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized in the first reporting period that it becomes more-likely-than-not such tax position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period. Differences between actual results and the Company’s assumptions, or changes in the Company’s assumptions in future periods, are recorded in the period they become known. The Company records potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from the Company’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more-likely-than-not that all or part of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial performance, scheduled reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, availability of taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies.
Income taxes are highly susceptible to changes from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about the Company’s future income over the lives of its deferred tax assets and the impact of changes in valuation allowances. Any difference in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could result in changes to the Company’s results of operations.
Revenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Other Contract Liabilities 
The Company generally recognizes revenue following a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers and generally provides for the recognition of revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, net of allowances for estimated returns, discounts or sales incentives, as well as taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities when control over the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer.
Healthcare segment
While the majority of the Company’s healthcare segment revenue contracts and transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some transactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. As a result, contract interpretation, judgment and analysis are required to determine the appropriate accounting, including: (i) the amount of the total consideration, as well as variable consideration, (ii) whether the arrangement contains an embedded lease, and if so, whether such embedded lease is a sales-type lease or an operating lease, (iii) the identification of the distinct performance obligations contained within the arrangement, (iv) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each performance obligation when multiple performance obligations exist, including the determination of standalone selling price, and (v) when to recognize revenue on the performance obligations. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from fixed lease payments related to equipment supplied under sales-type lease arrangements is recognized once control over the equipment is transferred to the customer, while revenue from fixed lease payments related to equipment supplied under operating-type lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and variable lease payments are recognized as they occur.

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The Company derives the majority of its healthcare segment revenue from 
four
 primary sources: (i) direct sales under deferred equipment agreements with end-user hospitals where the Company provides up-front monitoring equipment at no up-front charge in exchange for a multi-year sensor purchase commitment; (ii) other direct sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other direct customers; (iii) sales of noninvasive monitoring solutions to distributors who then typically resell to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations and other customers; and (iv) sales of integrated circuit boards to OEM customers who incorporate the Company’s embedded software technology into their multiparameter monitoring devices. Subject to customer credit considerations, the majority of such sales are made on open accounts using industry standard payment terms based on the geography within which the specific customer is located.
The Company enters into agreements to sell its monitoring solutions and services, sometimes as a part of arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include various combinations of product sales, equipment leases, software and services. In the case of contracts with multiple performance obligations, the authoritative guidance provides that the total consideration be allocated to each performance
 obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling prices. When a standalone selling price is not readily observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the product, geographies, type of customer, contractual prices pursuant to Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) contracts, the Company’s pricing and discount practices, and other market conditions.
Sales under deferred equipment ag
reements are generally structured such that the Company agrees to provide certain monitoring-related equipment, software, installation, training and/or warranty support at no up-front charge in exchange for the customer’s commitment to purchase sensors over the term of the agreement, which generally ranges from 
three years
 to 
six years
. The Company allocates contract consideration under deferred equipment agreements containing fixed annual sensor purchase commitments to the underlying lease and non-lease components at contract inception. In determining whether any underlying lease components are related to a sales-type lease or an operating lease, the Company evaluates the customer’s rights and ability to control the use of the underlying equipment throughout the contract term, including any equipment substitution rights retained by the Company, as well as the Company’s expectations surrounding potential contract/lease extensions or renewals and the customer’s likelihood to exercise any purchase options. 
Beginning in 2022, for contracts that contain variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate, the Company classifies as operating leases any lease components that would have otherwise been classified as sales-type leases that would result in a selling loss upon lease commencement. Revenue allocable to non-lease performance obligations is generally recognized as such non-lease performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue allocable to lease components under sales-type lease arrangements is generally recognized when control over the equipment is transferred to the customer. 
Revenue allocable to lease components under operating lease arrangements is generally recognized over the term of the operating lease. The Company generally does not expect to derive any significant value in excess of such asset’s unamortized book value from equipment underlying its operating lease arrangements after the end of the agreement.
Revenue from the sale of products and software, to end-user hospitals, emergency medical response organizations, other direct customers, distributors and OEM customers, is recognized by the Company when control of such performance obligations transfers to the customer based upon the terms of the contract or underlying purchase order.
Revenue related to OEM rainbow
®
 parameter software licenses is recognized by the Company upon the OEM’s shipment of its product to its customer, as reported to the Company by the OEM.
The Company provides certain customers with various sales incentives that may take the form of discounts or rebates. The Company records estimates related to these programs as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. In general, customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund. However, the Company allows returns under certain circumstances. At the end of each period, the Company estimates and accrues for these returns as a reduction to revenue. The Company estimates the revenue constraints related to these forms of variable consideration based on various factors, including expected purchasing volumes, prior sales and returns history, and specific contractual terms and limitations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Non-healthcare segment
Non-healthcare segment revenue is related to hardware and embedded software that is integrated into final products that are manufactured and sold by the Company. Products and related software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and all intended functionality is available to the customer upon purchase. Non-healthcare segment revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or service to customers, which is either upon shipment or upon delivery to the customers, depending on delivery terms.
The Company offers sales incentives and has customer programs consisting primarily of discounts and market development fund programs, and records them as contra revenue. Estimates for sales incentives are developed using the most likely amount and are included in the transaction price to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue would not result once the uncertainty is resolved. In developing these estimates, the Company also considers the susceptibility of the incentive to outside influences, the length of time until the uncertainty is resolved and the Company’s experience with similar contracts. Reductions in revenue related to discounts are allocated to products on a relative basis based on their respective standard selling price if there are undelivered products in a contract. Judgment is required to determine the timing and amount of recognition of marketing funds, which the Company estimates based on past practice of providing similar funds.
Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s distribution channels although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Sales made directly to customers from the Company’s website are paid at the time of product shipment. Prior to determining payment terms for each customer, an evaluation of such customer’s credit risk is performed. Contractual allowances are an offset to accounts receivable.
The Company recognizes non-healthcare royalty revenue associated with certain prepaid license arrangements. The Company recognizes non-healthcare revenue from the prepaid license arrangements based upon sales-based royalties when a subsequent sale occurs.
Shipping and Handling Costs and Fees
All shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Charges for shipping and handling billed to customers are included as a component of revenue.
Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
The Company’s policy is to present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
Deferred Costs and Other Contract Assets
The costs of monitoring-related equipment provided to customers under operating lease arrangements within the Company’s deferred equipment agreements are generally deferred and amortized to cost of goods sold over the life of the underlying contracts. Some of the Company’s deferred equipment agreements also contain provisions for certain allowances to be made directly to the end-user hospital customer at the inception of the arrangement. These allowances are generally allocated to the lease and non-lease components and recognized as a reduction to revenue as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company generally invoices its customers under deferred equipment agreements as sensors are provided to the customer. However, the Company may recognize revenue for certain non-lease performance obligations under deferred equipment agreements with fixed annual commitments at the time such performance obligations are satisfied and prior to the customer being invoiced. When this occurs, the Company records an unbilled contract receivable related to such revenue until the customer has been invoiced pursuant to the terms of the underlying deferred equipment agreement.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized and deferred if the Company expects such costs to be recoverable over the life of the contract and the contract term is greater than one year. Such deferred costs generally relate to certain incentive sales commissions earned by the Company’s internal sales team in connection with the execution of deferred equipment agreements and are amortized to expense over the expected term of the underlying contract.

Warranty
The Company generally provides a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period ranging from 
six months
 to 
forty-eight months
, depending on the product type. In traditional sales activities, including direct and OEM sales, the Company establishes an accrued liability for the estimated warranty costs at the time of revenue recognition, with a corresponding provision to cost of goods sold. Customers may also purchase extended warranty coverage or service level upgrades separately or as part of a deferred equipment agreement. Revenue related to extended warranty coverage and service level upgrades is generally recognized over the life of the contract, which reasonably approximates the period over which such services will be provided. The related extended warranty and service level upgrade costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs
Advertising costs include certain advertising, marketing and endorsement agreement fees. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Endorsement fees associated with product endorsers are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Prepayments made under endorsement agreements are included in other current assets or other non-current assets, depending on the period to which the prepayments applies. Certain endorsement agreements provide for royalty payments to endorsers based on sales of particular products, which the Company records in selling, general and administrative expense as the related sales occur. Advertising costs for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were $
58.2

Research and Development
Costs related to research and development activities are expensed as incurred. These costs include personnel costs, materials, depreciation and amortization on associated tangible and intangible assets and an allocation of facility costs, all of which are directly related to research and development activities
.

Litigation Costs and Contingencies
The Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of whether a loss contingency or litigation settlement is probable or reasonably possible involves a significant amount of management judgment, as does the estimation of the range of loss given the nature of contingencies. Liabilities related to litigation settlements 
with multiple elements are recorded based on the fair value of each element. Legal and other liti
gation related expenses are recognized as the services are provided. The Company records insurance and other indemnity recoveries for litigation expenses when both of the following conditions are met: (a) the recovery is probable, and (b) collectability is reasonably assured. Insurance recoveries are only recorded to the extent the litigation costs to which they relate have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements.

Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s international headquarters is in Switzerland, and its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company has many other foreign subsidiaries, and the largest transactions in foreign currency translations occur in the Japanese Yen, the British Pound, the Chinese Yuan and the European Euro.
The Company records certain revenues and expenses in foreign currencies. These revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars based on the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of a subsidiary that are denominated in the functional currency of such subsidiary are included as a component o
f accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Company, or a subsidiary that are not denominated in the underlying functional currency are included as a component of non-operating (loss) income within
 the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company addresses market risk from changes in interest rates risks through risk management programs, which include the use of derivative instruments. The Company’s exposure to a counterparty’s credit risk is generally limited to the amounts of the net obligation to the counterparty. The Company established policies to enter into contracts only with major investment-grade financial institutions to mitigate such counterparty credit risk. The Company also established a policy to further monitor the counterparty risks throughout the life of the instruments. None of the derivative instruments currently held by the Company were entered into for speculative trading purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as short-term or long-term based on the tenor of the instrument. The Company has elected not to separate a derivative instrument into current and long-term portions. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net liability is classified as current in total. A derivative instrument whose fair value is a net asset and whose current portion is an asset is classified as non-current in total. For a derivative instrument that meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company marks the fair value of the derivative instrument to market periodically through other comprehensive (loss) income. When the hedged items are recorded to income (loss), the associated deferred gains (losses) of the derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income will be reclassified into earnings. Any fluctuation in the fair value of a derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting is recorded to earnings (expense) in the period it occurs.
Comprehensive (Loss) Income
Comprehensive (loss) income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, changes to pension benefits, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges and any related tax benefits (expenses) that have been excluded from net income and reflected in stockholders’ equity.

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Net income per diluted s
hare is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of shares and potential shares outstanding during the period, if the effect of potential shares is dilutive. In periods when the Company has a net loss, equity awards are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. Potential shares include incremental shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of both restricted share units (RSUs) and perfo
rmance stock units (PSUs). For each of the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, weighted options to purchase 
1.1
 million, 
1.2
 million and 
0.8
 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share because the effect of including such shares would have been antidilutive in the applicable period. For each of the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, certain RSUs were considered contingently issuable shares as their vesting was contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Since such events have not occurred and were not considered probable of occurring as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
2.7

On October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate the employment of Mr. Kiani, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective October 24, 2024. In connection with the Board’s determination, the

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The new standard is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU No. 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company retrospectively adopted this standard during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. See Note 25,”Segment and Enterprise Reporting”, for further details on the impact of the adoption of this standard. 
Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The new standard requires companies to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The guidance in ASU No. 2024-03 requires public business entities to disclose in the notes to the financial statements, among other things, specific information about certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory; employee compensation; and depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for each caption on the income statement where such expenses are included. ASU No. 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01 to clarify the effective date of ASU No. 2024-03. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments may be applied prospectively to reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
3. Related Party Transactions 
On October 24, 2024, following a review by outside counsel, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate the employment of Mr. Kiani, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective October 24, 2024. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for further details.
Willow Laboratories, Inc. (Willow), formerly known as Cercacor Laboratories, Inc., is an independent entity that was spun off from the Company to its stockholders in 1998. Joe Kiani, the Company’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is also the Chairman and CEO of Willow. Effective as of January 3, 2016, in connection with changes in the capital structure of Willow, the Company determined that Willow was no longer required to be consolidated. Although the Company believes that Willow continues to be considered a variable interest entity, the Company has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of Willow as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Willow that most significantly impact Willow’s economic performance and has no obligation to absorb Willow’s losses.

6. Lease Receivable

For deferred equipment agreements that contain embedded operating leases, upon lease commencement, the Company defers and records the equipment cost of operating lease assets within property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation. These operating lease assets are subsequently amortized to cost of goods sold over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
For deferred equipment agreements that contain embedded sales-type leases, the Company recognizes lease revenue and costs, as well as a lease receivable, at the time the lease commences. Lease revenue related to both operating-type and sales-type leases for the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was approximately $

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing, unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing, if impairment indicators ex
ist. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis and, based on this assessment, the Company determined the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit were impaired by approximately $
10.0
 million. For indefinite-lived intangibles, the fair values were estimated using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, which involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.
Given the indefinite-lived intangibles impairment, the Company next assessed the recoverability of its other long-lived assets in n
on-healthcare. For unit of account purposes, this included grouping certain assets such as finite-lived intangibles, lessee ROU assets, and property and equipment due to the interdependency of these assets. The v
aluation analysis included a probability-weighted recoverability test, which is subject to assumptions and uncertainties such as scenario probabilities, including the potential separation of Sound United scenario. Based on this valuation analysis, these long-lived assets were determined to be recoverable.
For the non-healthcare reporting unit, the Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment for its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company used a combination of both an income and a market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market approach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach to calculate projected future discounted cash flows included revenue growth rates, operating margins and a discount rate for the reporting unit. Given the potential separation of Sound United, the market approach considered comparable public companies in a similar line of business to Sound United, and multiples were applied based on the relative performance and risk profile of the non-healthcare reporting unit. Discount rates were determined using a weighted average cost of capital for risk factors specific to the reporting unit and other market and industry data. The assumptions used are inherently subject to uncertainty and the Company noted that slight changes in these assumptions and probabilities could have a significant impact on the concluded value and analysis. For the non-healthcare reporting unit, goodwill was fully impaired such that the impairment expense was approximately $
294.0
 million.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include the discount rate and forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins, to calculate projected future discounted cash flows. The non-healthcare forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins assume recovery from the current business downturn while also employing strategies to expand in key market segments. 
These fair value measurements require significant judgements using Level 3 inputs, such as discounted projected cash flows, which are not observable from the market, directly or indirectly. If future actual results adversely deviate from the forecast, assumptions or probabilities in the analysis, there will be a materially differ
ent assessment. As such, the Company will continue to monitor events occurring or circumstances changing which may necessitate further impairment assessments for intangibles and other long-lived assets.
For healthcare goodwill, the Company performed a qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter 2024 for its annual impairment analysis. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required on this reporting unit.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In the third quarter of 2023, declines in the Company’s stock price and certain worsening macro-economic market conditions, including continued slowing in demand for consumer audio products, contributed to a significant decline in the Company’s market capitalization, which led the Company to conclude a trigger event had occurred. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which resulted in recording a $
7.0
 million impairment charge for indefinite-lived trademarks in the non-healthcare reporting unit. In conjunction with this third quarter interim impairment quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that both the healthcare reporting unit’s and non-healthcare reporting unit’s respective estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. Furthermore, recoverability tests performed for other long-lived assets with finite lives indicated no recoverability issues.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles within the non-healthcare reporting unit exceeded their carrying values.

Accordingly, the Company proceeded to perform a quantitative impairment assessment, which resulted in recording a $
3.0
 million impairment charge for indefinite-lived trademarks. For purposes of the impairment test, the fair value of indefinite-lived assets were determined using the same methodology as described in Note 18, “Business Combinations.” The estimates and assumptions applied represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s assumptions in measuring fair value.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis by first electing to complete a qualitative assessment for its healthcare and non-healthcare reporting units. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Accordingly, no further testing was required for the healthcare reporting unit. However, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the non-healthcare reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Therefore, the Company proceeded to perform a quantitative assessment for its non-healthcare reporting unit. 
When a quantitative assessment is required for the impairment test for goodwill, the Company uses a combination of both an income and a market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market approach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach to calculate projected future discounted cash flows included revenue growth rates, operating margins and a discount rate for the reporting unit. Discount rates were determined using a weighted average cost of capital for risk factors specific to the reporting unit and other market and industry data. The assumptions used are inherently subject to uncertainty and the Company noted that slight changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value. 
The estimates and assumptions applied represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by limited or no market activity and reflect the Company’s assumptions in measuring fair value.

11. Lessee ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities

The Company leases certain facilities in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions under operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through January 2032. In addition, the Company leases equipment in the U.S. and Europe pursuant to leases that are classified as operating leases and expire at various dates through November 2028. The majority of these leases are non-cancellable and generally do not contain any material restrictive covenants, material residual value guarantees, or other material guarantees. The Company recognizes lease costs under these agreements using a straight-line method based on total lease payments. Certain facility leases contain predetermined price escalations and in some cases renewal options, the longest of which is for 
five years
.
The Company generally estimates the applicable discount rate used to determine the net present value of lease payments based on available information at the lease commencement date. For the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the weighted-average discount rate used by the Company for all operating leases was approximately 
4.6
% and 
4.1
%, respectively.
The balance sheet classifications for amounts related to the Company’s operating leases for which it is the lessee are as follows:

Table of Contents
MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Healthcare Deferred Revenue
Healthcare deferred revenue primarily relates to undelivered equipment, sensors and services under deferred equipment agreements, extended warranty agreements and maintenance agreements. Expected revenue from remaining contractual performance obligations (Unrecognized Contract Revenue) includes deferred revenue, as well as other amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods when the Company completes its performance obligations. Unrecognized Contract Revenue excludes revenue allocable to monitoring-related equipment that is effectively leased to customers under deferred equipment agreements and other contractual obligations for which neither party has performed. The estimated timing of this revenue is based, in part, on management’s estimates and assumptions about when its performance obligations will be completed. As a result, the actual timing of this revenue in future periods may vary, possibly materially, due to factors such as healthcare facility spending trends, hospital inpatient census and seasonality. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $
1,773.3
 million of Unrecognized Contract Revenue related to executed contracts with an original duration of 
one year
 or more. The Company expects to recognize approximately $
510.7
 million of this amount as revenue within the next 
twelve months
 and the remaining balance thereafter.
Non-Healthcare Deferred Revenue
In October 2020, the Company’s subsidiary, B&W Group Ltd. (B&W), entered into an amendment to a licensing agreement, whereby B&W received a $
20.0
 million royalty prepayment in relation to sound system units manufactured under the Bowers & Wilkins brand for various high-end car manufacturers with a total commitment of $

Credit Facility
On April 11, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (Credit Facility) with financial institutions party thereto as initial lenders (collectively, the Initial Lenders), Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of the West and BofA Securities, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of the West and BofA Securities, Inc., as co-syndication agents.
The Credit Facility provides for an unsecured term loan of $
300.0
 million (Term Loan) and $
500.0
 million of on-going unsecured revolving commitments (Revolver), with an option, subject to certain conditions, for the Company to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity by an additional $
400.0
 million (plus additional unlimited amounts if certain incurrence tests are met) in the future with the Initial Lenders and additional lenders, as required. Debt issuance costs of $
8.4
 million were recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Credit Facility and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
The Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to $
50.0
 million for the issuance of letters of credit. 
Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be deemed, at the Company’s election, either: (a) an Alternate Base Rate (ABR) Loan, which bears interest at the ABR, plus a spread of 
0.000
% to 
0.750
% based upon a Company leverage ratio, or (b) a Term SOFR Loan, which bears interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined below), plus a spread of 
1.000
% to 
1.750
% based upon a Company net leverage ratio. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the ABR is equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York effective rate plus 
0.50
%, and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 
1.0
%. The Adjusted Term SOFR Rate is equal to the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the applicable interest period plus a spread adjustment of 
0.10
%, 
0.15
% and 
0.25
% for the interest periods ending one, three and six months, respectively. At December 28, 2024, the effective interest rate on the Credit Facility was 
5.9
%.
The Company is also obligated under the Credit Facility to pay an unused fee ranging from 
0.150
% to 
0.275
% per annum, based upon a Company leverage ratio, with respect to any non-utilized portion of the Credit Facility.
The Company is subject to certain covenants, including financial covenants related to a net leverage ratio and an interest charge coverage ratio, and other customary negative covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default which, upon the occurrence of any such event of default, provide the Initial Lenders (and any additional lenders) with the right to take either or both of the following actions: (a) immediately terminate the commitments, and (b) declare the loans then outstanding immediately due and payable in full. All unpaid principal under the Credit Facility will become due and payable on April 12, 2027.
On May 16, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment) with the Initial Lenders and Citibank, N.A., as the administrative agent, which amended the Credit Facility. The First Amendment provides for an additional $
205
 million of unsecured revolving commitments, increasing the aggregate amount of the Revolver from $
500
 million to $
705
 million. 
Borrowing rates, maturity date, financial covenants, affirmative and negative covenants and other restricted terms remain unchanged from the Credit Facility. All unpaid principal under the First Amendment will become due and payable on April 12, 2027.

17. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative Instruments - Cash Flow Hedges 
The Company’s cash flow hedges are designed to mitigate the risk of exposure to variability in expected future cash flows of recognized assets, liabilities or any unrecognized forecasted transactions. Since July 2022, the Company has entered into various interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges on a substantial portion of the Company’s outstanding debt. The interest rate swaps reduce the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s long-term debt to an average fixed interest rate of 
3.20
%. These contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of approximately 
three years
. All hedging relationships were highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. The Company used a regression analysis at hedge inception to assess the effectiveness of cash flow hedge and periodically thereafter.
The Company records gains and losses from the changes in the fair value of these instruments as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Deferred gains or losses from these designated cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged items affect earnings. The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments in its consolidated balance sheets for presentation purposes.

Sound United Acquisition
On April 11, 2022, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Sound United, pursuant to a Merger Agreement dated as of February 15, 2022, by and among the Company, Sonic Boom Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), Viper Holdings Corporation (Sound United), and, solely in its capacity as the Seller Representative, Viper Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Sound United, with Sound United continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger).
Sound United is a leading innovator of premium, high-performance audio products for consumers around the world, which operates iconic consumer brands: Bowers & Wilkins
®
, Denon
™
, Marantz
™
, HEOS
™
, Classé
™
, Polk Audio
™
, Boston Acoustics
™
 and Definitive Technology
™
. The brands are linked by a commitment to the highest production standards and a focus on unparalleled audio quality and audio performance. Sound United delivers significant competitive benefits through its platform advantages, including global distribution across online, retail, and custom installation channels; a cloud-connected home ecosystem; and a state-of-the-art research and development function focused on creating the highest-quality consumer products with world-class industrial design.
The Company acquired 
100
% of the equity interests of Sound United for $
1.0575
 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on Sound United’s net working capital, transaction expenses, cash and debt as of the closing of the Merger, payable by the Company in cash. The transaction was primarily funded with the proceeds from the Credit Facility. See Note 15, “Debt”, for additional information about the Credit Facility. There was no contingent consideration resulting from the transaction.
The results of operations of Sound United subsequent to the acquisition date and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including the allocation of goodwill and intangible assets, are included in the non-healthcare segment. For the period of April 11, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the Company recorded revenue of $
694.9
 million and a net loss of $
38.6
 million from Sound United. For the period of January 1, 2023 to December 30, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of $
771.1
 million and a net loss of $
20.9
 million from Sound United. For the period of December 31, 2023 to December 28, 2024, the Company recorded revenue of $
697.4
 million and a net loss of $
309.5
 million from Sound United.
Acquisition Costs
The Company recognized transaction costs related to the Sound United acquisition of $
16.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company recognized 
no
 transaction costs related to the Sound United acquisition for the year ended December 30, 2023 and December 28, 2024.
Purchase Price Allocations
The purchase price allocation for the Sound United acquisition is final. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The measurement period adjustments resulted primarily from valuation inputs pertaining to certain acquired assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from events subsequent to the acquisition date.
The table below summarizes the final allocation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

In determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Other inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates. Contractual license agreements have a weighted-average amortization period of five years until the next renewal term.

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:
Customer relationships
The fair value of customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method involves forecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets and then discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.
Trademarks/tradenames
The fair values of the trademark/tradenames were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was applied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life, royalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate. 
Developed technology
The fair values of the developed technology were determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes, and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Judgment was applied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, survival rates, technology life, royalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.
Contractual licensing agreements
The fair value of the contractual license agreements was determined using a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method. This method involves forecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset and then discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.
Unaudited pro forma financial information
The supplemental pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and is based on the historical financial information of Masimo and Sound United, assuming the transaction occurred on January 1, 2021. The supplemental pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent what the combined companies’ revenue or results of operations would have been had the acquisition of Sound United been completed on January 1, 2021, nor is it intended to be a projection of future operating results of the combined company. It also does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that might be achieved from synergies of combining Masimo and Sound United.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information has been calculated after applying Masimo’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of the combined Company to reflect incremental amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the fair value adjustments for acquired intangible assets, inventory, property, plant and equipment as well as the net decrease to interest expense resulting from the elimination of the historical interest expense on Sound United’s debt that was paid off at closing partially offset by incremental interest expense resulting from the external debt borrowed by Masimo to fund the acquisition, and the corresponding income tax impact of these adjustments.
Also, during the year ended December 31, 2022, Masimo and Sound United incurred $
22.4
 million and $
41.1
 million of acquisition-related costs, respectively. These expenses are included in the pro forma net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 in the table below.
There are no other material non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the Sound United Acquisition included in the reported pro forma revenue and pro forma net income.

Equity

Incentive Plans
2007 Stock Incentive Plan
Effective June 1, 2017, upon the approval and ratification of the Masimo Corporation 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (2017 Equity Plan), the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) terminated, provided that awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of that plan. In addition, upon the effectiveness of the 2017 Equity Plan, an aggregate of 
5.0
 million shares of the Company’s common stock registered under prior registration statements for issuance pursuant to the 2007 Equity Plan were deregistered and concurrently registered under the 2017 Equity Plan.
2017 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2017 Equity Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, performance shares, performance bonus awards and other stock or cash awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any parent or subsidiary of the Company. Upon effectiveness, an aggregate of 
5.0
 million shares were available for issuance under the 2017 Equity Plan. In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase of 
2.5
 million shares to the 2017 Equity Plan. The aggregate number of shares that may be awarded under the 2017 Equity Plan is 
7.5
 million shares. The 2017 Equity Plan provides that at least 
95
% of the equity awards issued under the 2017 Equity Plan must vest over a period of not less than 
one year
 following the date of grant. The exercise price per share of each option granted under the 2017 Equity Plan may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which is generally equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date.
Total stock-based compensation expense under both the 2007 Equity Plan and the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $

On February 26, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the weighted payout percentage for the 2021 PSU awards (

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company awarded 
162,562
 PSUs that will vest 
three years
 from the award date, based on the achievement of certain fiscal year 2024 performance criteria approved by the Compensation Committee. If earned, the PSUs granted will vest upon achievement of the performance criteria after the year in which the performance achievement level has been determined. The number of shares that may be earned can range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target amount; therefore, the maximum number of shares that can be issued under these awards is twice the original award of 
162,562
 PSUs, or 
325,124
 shares.
During the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company awarded 
103,000
 PSUs that will vest

Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions and the cumulative effect of any changes in the probability outcomes is recorded in the period in which the changes occur. If earned, the PSUs granted will vest upon achievement of the performance criteria, which include a relative total shareholder return (TSR) component, in the year following the evaluation and confirmation of the performance achievement criteria. The Company’s TSR is based on the Company’s common stock percentile ranking relative to the constituents of the Nasdaq Composite Index for the performance period beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025. The number of shares that may be earned can range from 
0

The fair value of market-based RSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The fair value of performance-based PSUs is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest, total PSU expense (benefit) for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $
2.7

Risk-free interest rate.
 The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the Company’s stock options.
Expected term.
 The expected term represents the average period that the Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on both the Company’s specific historical option exercise experience, as well as expected term information available from a peer group of companies with a similar vesting schedule.
Estimated volatility.
 The estimated volatility is the amount by which the Company’s share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The Company’s estimated volatilities for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are based on historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s share price over the expected term of the option. 
Expected dividends.
 The Board may from time to time declare, and the Company may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by law. Any determination to declare and pay dividends will be made by the Board and will depend upon the Company’s results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. In the event a dividend is declared, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, timing or frequency of any such dividends. The dividend declared in 2012 was deemed to be a special dividend and there is no assurance that special dividends will be declared again during the expected term. Based on this uncertainty and unknown frequency, for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no dividend rate was used in the assumptions to calculate the stock-based compensation expense.
The Company has elected to recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, net of forfeitures. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur. The total fair value of all options that vested during the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $
8.3
 million, $
9.5
 million and $
12.4
 million, respectively.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options is calculated as the positive difference, if any, between the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise or the respective period end, as appropriate, and the exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, with an exercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of December 28, 2024 was $
108.5
 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable with an exercise price less than the closing price of the Company’s common stock, as of December 28, 2024 was $
105.8
 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $
58.2
 million, $
19.0
 million and $

21. Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution Plans
In the U.S., the Company sponsors 
one
 qualified defined contribution plan or 401(k) plan, the Masimo Retirement Savings Plan (MRSP), covering the Company’s full-time U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. On April 11, 2022, in connection with the Sound United acquisition, the MRSP was amended to allow for participation by eligible Sound United employees.
The MRSP matches 
100
% of a participant’s salary deferral, up to 
3
% of each participant’s compensation for the pay period, subject to a maximum amount. The Company may also contribute to the MRSP on a discretionary basis. The Company contributed $
4.6
 million, $
4.9
 million and $
4.5
 million to the MRSP for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, all in the form of matching contributions.
In addition, some of the Company’s international subsidiaries also have defined contribution plans to which both the employee and employers are eligible to make contributions. The Company contributed $
6.1
 million and $
5.5
 million for the year ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The Company contributed 
immaterial
 amounts to these plans for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors several international noncontributory defined benefit plans. In connection with the Sound United acquisition, the Company assumed sponsorship of several international defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans. All defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans assumed by the Company were closed to new participants prior to the Sound United acquisition.
The service cost component for the defined benefit plans are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All other cost components are recorded in non-operating (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations. 
The following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the Company’s defined benefit plans.

Due to the timing of a cash transfer, there was a payable as of December 28, 2024, resulting in a negative allocation as of year end.
The net decrease in the fair value of the Company’s plan assets for the year ended December 28, 2024 was principally driven by higher benefits paid of $

 million on the plan assets, partially offset by higher employer contributions of $
1.5

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The Plan invests in a diversified portfolio of assets intended to minimize risk of poor returns while maximizing expected portfolio returns. The actual portfolio investment mix may, from time to time, deviate from the established target mix due to various factors such as normal market fluctuations, the reliance on estimates in connection with the determination of allocations and normal portfolio activity such as additions and withdrawals. The target allocations are subject to periodic review, including a review of the asset portfolio’s performance, by the named fiduciary of the plans. Such plans have local independent fiduciary advisors with responsibility for the development and oversight of the investment policy, including asset allocation decisions. In making such decisions, consideration is given to local regulations, investment practices and funding rules. The fair value of investments is included in the fair value hierarchy, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.

While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Plan Contributions
The Company determines expected funding needs of its defined benefit pension plans based on legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax consequences, the cash flow generated by the Company and other factors. The Company made $
1.9
 million and $
0.4

As of December 28, 2024, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
997.5
 million. Because such earnings have previously been subject to U.S. tax are eligible for a dividends received deduction when repatriated, any additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of its foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign withholding and state taxes. The Company considers $
86.5
 million of these accumulated undistributed earnings as no longer permanently reinvested and has accrued foreign withholding and state taxes, net of estimated foreign tax credits, of $
1.9
 million. The Company intends, however, to indefinitely reinvest the remaining $
911
 million of earnings. If the Company decides to distribute such permanently reinvested earnings, the Company would accrue estimated additional income tax expense of up to approximately $

As of December 28, 2024, the Company has $
43.7
 million and $
157.1
 million of net operating losses from federal and various state jurisdictions, which will begin to expire in 2037 and 2025, respectively. Additionally, the Company has $
125.9
 million of net operating losses from foreign jurisdictions that will begin to expire in 2025. The Company also has federal research and development tax credits of $
2.8
 million that will begin to expire in 2031, state research and development tax credits of $
35.8
 million that will carry forward indefinitely, $
2.7
 million of foreign tax credits on research and development expenditures that will begin to expire in 2042 and $
6.8
 million of Swiss tax credits that will begin to expire in 2026. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company established a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets relating to certain acquired operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions that the Company believes are not likely to be realized. During the year ended December 28, 2024, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $
7.6
 million, primarily due to the losses of certain foreign operations and certain state jurisdictions that the Company believes are not likely to be realized.
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:

The amount of unrecognized benefits which, if ultimately recognized, could favorably affect the tax rate in a future period was $
35.6
 million and $
30.6
 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in various jurisdictions may change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements. However, due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of these events, an estimate of the change within the next twelve months cannot currently be made.
For the year ended December 28, 2024 the Company recorded an expense of $
0.6
 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. For the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company recorded a benefit of $
1.0
 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a benefit of $
0.3
 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.
Total accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were $
2.7
 million and $
2.1
 million, respectively.
The Company conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and, as a result, one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal, various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2020. All material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded through fiscal year 2017.
The Company does not believe that the results of any tax authority examination would have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
24. Commitments and Contingencies 
Employment and Severance Agreements
The Company and Mr. Kiani entered into an employment agreement on November 4, 2015 (as thereafter amended and waived, the Amended Employment Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Employment Agreement, upon a “Qualifying Termination” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement), Mr. Kiani would be entitled to receive (i) a cash severance benefit equal to two times the sum of his then-current base salary and the average annual bonus paid to Mr. Kiani during the immediately preceding 
three years
, (ii) immediate vesting of Mr. Kiani’s stock options and equity awards, (iii) 
2.7
 million restricted shares units (RSUs), and (iv) a cash payment of $
35
 million (the Cash Payment and, together with the RSUs, the Special Payment). As set forth in the Amended Employment Agreement, a Qualifying Termination includes a termination by Mr. Kiani for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement), which includes, among other things, (i) any diminution of Mr. Kiani’s responsibilities, duties and authority as set forth in Section 2 of the Amended Employment Agreement, (ii) Mr. Kiani ceasing to serve as Company’s CEO and Chairman (the Chairman Provision), and (iii) a “Change-in-Control” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement).

Additionally, in the event of a Change in Control prior to a Qualifying Termination, Mr. Kiani’s stock options and any other equity awards will vest in accordance with their terms, but in no event later than in two equal installments on each of the one year and two year anniversaries of the Change in Control, subject in each case to Mr. Kiani’s continuous employment through each such anniversary date. 
On January 14, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Amended Employment Agreement (Second Amendment) with Mr. Kiani. The Second Amendment provides that the RSUs granted to Mr. Kiani pursuant to the Amended Employment Agreement will vest in full upon the termination of Mr. Kiani’s employment with the Company pursuant to Mr. Kiani’s death or disability.
On February 8, 2023, Mr. Kiani agreed that the valid election to the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of any two individuals nominated by the Company’s stockholders in lieu of two of the Company’s then-current Board members would not be deemed to constitute a Change in Control for purposes of Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement.
On March 22, 2023, in connection with the Board’s unanimous selection of H Michael Cohen as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Kiani voluntarily irrevocably and permanently waived his right to treat the appointment of any lead independent director as “Good Reason” to terminate his employment under the Amended Employment Agreement, and waived his right to receive contractual separation payments on this basis.
On June 5, 2023, Mr. Kiani, pursuant to a Limited Waiver (Waiver), unconditionally, irrevocably and permanently waived his right, pursuant to the Amended Employment Agreement, to assert that a “Change in Control” has occurred pursuant to Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement unless the individuals who constituted the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding such change, as defined in Section 9(iii) of the Amended Employment Agreement, cease for any reason to constitute one-half or more of the directors then in office. In addition, Mr. Kiani agreed that, for purposes of determining whether such a “Change in Control” has occurred, any individual elected to the Board at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be treated as a member of the Board at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.
As a result of Mr. Kiani’s execution of the Waiver on June 5, 2023, which waived certain of the “Change in Control” provisions in the Amended Employment Agreement, the Company remeasured the expense related to the Award Shares and Cash Payment that would be recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination under the Amended Employment Agreement, as amended by the Second Amendment, and the expense was determined to be approximately $
479.7
 million.
On September 19, 2024, at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company’s stockholders voted to not reelect Mr. Kiani to the Board. Additionally, on September 19, 2024, after the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the Board stating his decision to resign from his position of CEO of the Company and filed a claim in California Superior Court relating to his Amended Employment Agreement (the Kiani California Litigation), seeking, among other things, declaratory relief that he had validly terminated his employment for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement), and that he was entitled to certain benefits provided in the Amended Employment agreement upon termination for “Good Reason”.
Following an investigation by outside counsel, in which counsel collected and reviewed relevant documents, it was determined that the Company had grounds to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment for cause. On October 24, 2024, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment for cause, effective that day. The termination was not a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement). Consequently, the Company believes Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment under the Amended Employment Agreement.

Also on October 24, 2024, the Company filed claims against Mr. Kiani in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Kiani Delaware Litigation), seeking judicial declarations that numerous provisions in Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement, including the Special Payment, are invalid, unenforceable, and amount to a waste of corporate assets and, therefore, that Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment. The Company’s complaint alleges that the Company’s directors at the time of the initial adoption of Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement and at the adoption of subsequent amendments abdicated their fiduciary duties as a matter of Delaware law by approving the Amended Employment Agreement, which contained provisions intended to entrench Mr. Kiani’s control of the Company indefinitely.
On November 13, 2024 we entered into an employment agreement (Brennan Agreement) with Ms. Brennan, who the Board appointed Interim CEO on September 24, 2024. The Brennan Agreement, effective as of the September 24, 2024 appointment, has a term of six months unless earlier terminated by its terms (Brennan Term).
The Brennan Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $
1,042,000
. Additionally, Ms. Brennan is eligible for a discretionary bonus of a target amount equal to $
621,250
 at the end of the Brennan Term, with the actual amount to be determined at the discretion of the Board.
Under the Brennan Agreement, Ms. Brennan has been granted an equity award of 
8,916
 RSUs, which will vest in one installment on the first to occur of (i) the March 24, 2025 and (ii) the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The RSUs will be granted under Company’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, or its successor (2017 Equity Plan) and subject to the terms of the 2017 Equity Plan and an award agreement with terms and conditions consistent with grants made to other Company employees. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Company common stock after the vesting date. 
Ms. Brennan is entitled to participate in all Company employee benefits plans and programs maintained by the Company from time to time, at a level consistent with the benefits provided to other senior executives, subject to the provision of such plans and programs.
As of December 28, 2024, the Company had severance plan participation agreements with 
five
 executive officers. The participation agreements (the Agreements) are governed by the terms and conditions of the Company’s 2007 Severance Protection Plan (the Severance Plan), which became effective on July 19, 2007 and which was amended effective December 31, 2008.
Under each of the Agreements, the applicable executive officer may be entitled to receive certain salary, equity, medical and life insurance benefits if he is terminated by the Company without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason under certain circumstances. Each executive officer is also required to give the Company 
six months
’ advance notice of his resignation under certain circumstances.
On January 17, 2025, the Company and Ms. Catherine Szyman entered into an offer letter (the Offer Letter”) in respect of her service as the next CEO of Masimo, effective as of February 12, 2025 (the “Effective Date”). Under the Offer Letter, Ms. Szyman’s will receive an initial annual base salary of $
1,000,000
, a target annual bonus opportunity of 
100
% of base salary and a maximum annual bonus opportunity equal to 
200
% of such target, and an annual target long-term incentive award opportunity of $
7,000,000
. To the extent that the Company determines after the Effective Date to adopt a policy for the vesting of performance stock units upon retirement, any such retirement policy that applies to Ms. Szyman will be no worse than the attainment of 
60
 years of age and at least 
five years
 of continuous employment with the Company. Ms. Szyman will also be eligible to participate in the Company’s employee benefit plans and programs applicable to senior executives of the Company generally, as may be in effect from time to time.

Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement Provisions
The Company’s Cross-Licensing Agreement with Willow contains annual minimum aggregate royalty obligations for use of the rainbow
®
 licensed technology, which is a perpetual global license. Prior to a change in control, which is defined in the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement to include, among other things, Mr. Kiani ceasing to serve as CEO of either the Company or Willow, the Company’s annual minimum royalty obligation is $
5.0
 million. Upon a change in control of the Company or Willow: (i) all rights to the “Masimo” trademark will be assigned to Willow if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use “Masimo” as a company name and trademark; (ii) the option to license technology developed by Willow for use in blood glucose monitoring will be deemed automatically exercised and a $
2.5
 million license fee for this technology will become immediately payable to Willow; and (iii) the minimum aggregate annual royalties payable to Willow for carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin and/or glucose measurements will increase to $
15.0
 million per year until the exclusivity period of the agreement ends, plus up to $
2.0
 million for each additional rainbow
®
 parameter (with no maximum ceiling for non-vital sign measurements). Any payment due annually to Willow resulting from a change in control of the Company is less than what the Company paid to Willow for licensing rights in 2022 or 2023.
On October 24, 2024, a change in control as defined in the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement occurred when Mr. Kiani’s employment as the Company’s CEO was terminated, resulting in a payment of $
2.5
 million for the licensing of Willow blood glucose monitoring technology. A change in control does not otherwise impact the scope or duration of the license rights. No additional accruals or payments were made in connection with the change in control under the Willow Cross-Licensing Agreement.
Purchase Commitments
Pursuant to contractual obligations with vendors, the Company had $
291.2
 million of purchase commitments as of December 28, 2024 that are expected to be purchased within one year. These purchase commitments have been made for certain inventory items in order to secure sufficient levels of those items, other critical inventory and manufacturing supplies, and to achieve better pricing.
Other

Contractual Commitments 
In the normal course of business, the Company may provide bank guarantees to support government hospital tenders in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $
4.8
 million in outstanding unsecured bank guarantees.
In certain circumstances, the Company also provides limited indemnification within its various customer contracts whereby the Company indemnifies the parties to whom it sells its products with respect to potential infringement of intellectual property, and against bodily injury caused by a defective Company product. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had not incurred any significant costs related to contractual indemnification of its customers.
Fees Agreements 
On January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a one year alternative fee agreement (Fee Agreement) with respect to certain on-going legal fees and costs charged by a vendor. The Fee Agreement imposes certain limits on a quarterly and annual basis for actual legal fees incurred by the vendor that are payable based on work performed related to litigation matters against Apple (see the heading “Litigation” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” for further details). If the vendor is successful in obtaining a favorable judgment for the Company on any claim or counterclaim after exhaustion or dismissal of any appeals, or upon settlement resulting in monetary consideration to the Company, the vendor will be paid a success fee equal to three times the amount of the excess of the annual legal fee limit within 
60
 days after entry of a judgement or the effective date of any settlement. As of December 28, 2024, the potential success fee that could be payable if the above event occurs is approximately $
18.6
 million. Amounts due to the vendor under this Fee Agreement will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.
In connection with the potential separation of the Company’s consumer businesses, the Company entered into contingent or discretionary fee agreement with various service providers, advisors and consultants. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the contingent fees due under these agreement at this time. Amounts due will be recognized when probable and reasonably estimable.

Endorsement Agreements 
The Company entered into 
two
 endorsement agreements, effective on February 1, 2024 and April 12, 2024, respectively, with terms ranging from 
18
 months to 
36
 months, for an approximate total commitment of $
11.5
 million, plus applicable taxes. One of these agreements also contains certain royalty payments provisions based on sales of particular products, with a minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $
0.5
 million.
The Company terminated 
one
 endorsement agreement, effective October 22, 2024, and recorded a charge of $
2.0
 million in connection with such termination, which was recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses.
As of December 28, 2024, the outstanding amount of the obligations under the 
one
 remaining endorsement agreement was approximately $
5.8
 million.
Concentrations
 of 
Risk
The Company is exposed to credit loss for the amount of its cash deposits with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company invests a portion of its excess cash with major financial institutions. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had $
177.6
 million of bank balances, of which $
7.9
 million was covered by either the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit or foreign countries’ deposit insurance organizations.
The Company’s ability to sell its healthcare products to U.S. hospitals depends in part on its relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential healthcare customers for the Company’s products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes exclusively, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members. During the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, revenue from the sale of the Company’s healthcare products to customers that are members of GPOs approximated 
56.9
%, 
53.2
% and 
53.8
% of healthcare revenue, respectively.
For the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had sales through 
one
 just-in-time healthcare distributor that represented 
12.3
%, 
11.2
%, and 
10.1
% of consolidated revenue, respectively. 
As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, 
one
 healthcare customer represented 
8.1
% and 
6.4
%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance. The receivable balance related to such healthcare customer is fully secured by a letter of credit.
As of December 28, 2024, there were no customer concentration risks associated with the Company’s non-healthcare business. 
Litigation
On January 9, 2020, the Company filed a complaint against Apple Inc. (Apple) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for infringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation, and for ownership and correction of inventorship of a number of Apple patents listing one of its former employees as an inventor. The Company is seeking damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment regarding ownership of the Apple patents. Apple filed petitions for Inter Partes review (IPR) of the asserted patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO instituted IPR of the asserted patents. On October 13, 2020, the District Court stayed the patent infringement claims pending completion of the IPR proceedings. In the IPR proceedings, one or more of the challenged claims of 
three
 of the asserted patents were found valid. The challenged claims of 
nine
 of the asserted patents were found invalid. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed all the IPR decisions except it reversed a finding of invalidity for certain dependent claims of one Masimo patent. From April 4, 2023 through May 1, 2023, the District Court held a jury trial on the trade secret, ownership, and inventorship claims. The District Court granted Apple’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on certain trade secrets and denied the remainder of Apple’s motion. On May 1, 2023, the District Court declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The District Court conducted a bench trial on the trade secret, ownership, and inventorship claims which commenced on November 5, 2024. The final argument following the bench trial occurred on for February 3, 2025. The stay of the patent infringement claims has been lifted and those claims will be tried at a later date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
On June 30, 2021, the Company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple for infringement of a number of other patents. The Company filed an amended complaint on July 12, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the ITC issued a Notice of Institution of Investigation on the asserted patents. From June 6, 2022 to June 10, 2022, the ITC conducted an evidentiary hearing. In July and August 2022, Apple filed petitions for IPR of the asserted patents in the PTO. On January 10, 2023, a United States Administrative Law Judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Apple violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 337), as amended, by importing and selling within the United States certain Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry functionality and components, which infringe several claims of the Company’s pulse oximeter patents. On January 24, 2023, the United States Administrative Law Judge further recommended that the ITC issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order on certain Apple Watches. On October 26, 2023, the ITC issued a Notice of Final Determination finding a violation of Section 337 by Apple. The ITC determined that that appropriate form of relief is a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) prohibiting the unlicensed entry of infringing wearable electronic devices with light-based pulse oximetry functionality manufactured by or on behalf of Apple, and a Cease and Desist Order (CDO). The LEO and CDO went into effect after the 60-day Presidential review period expired. The LEO and CDO are currently in effect. Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit is pending. On January 30, 2023, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings for the Company’s pulse oximeter patents that the ITC ruled were infringed. With respect to the other patents asserted at the ITC, the PTO denied institution of IPR proceedings for 
two
 patents and instituted IPR proceedings for 
two
 patents in January and February 2023. In the IPR proceedings, one or more of the challenged claims were found valid, while others were found invalid. Appeals for the two IPRs are pending. On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Exclusion Order Enforcement Branch issued a ruling letter allowing importation of certain Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature disabled.
On October 20, 2022, Apple filed 
two
 complaints against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Masimo W1
® 
watch infringes six utility and four design patents. Apple is seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December 12, 2022, the Company counterclaimed for monopolization, attempted monopolization, false advertising (and related causes of action) and infringement of ten patents. The Company is seeking damages and injunctive relief. On May 5, 2023, the Court ordered that the two cases be coordinated through the pre-trial stage. The Court held a case management conference in March 2024. On October 7, 2024, the Court granted summary judgement dismissing the Company’s inequitable conduct defense and counterclaim. The Court held a jury trial in October 2024 on Apple’s patent claims. The jury found that Company’s current product offerings do not infringe any Apple patents. The jury found a discontinued version of the Masimo W1
®
 watch infringed one design patent and a discontinued version of the Masimo W1
®
 watch charger infringed a second design patent. The jury awarded Apple a total of $
250
. The Company’s patent, false advertising, and antitrust counterclaims will be tried at a later date. The Company intends to vigorously pursue all of its claims against Apple and believes the Company has good and substantial defenses to Apple’s claims, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.
On August 22, 2023, a putative class action complaint was filed by Sergio Vazquez against the Company and members of its management alleging violations of the federal securities laws. On November 14, 2023, the court appointed Boston Retirement System, Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund-Defined Benefit Plan, and Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund-Retirement Income Plan 1987 as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 12, 2024. The amended complaint alleges that the Company and members of its management, from May 4, 2022 through August 8, 2023, disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts relating to the performance of its healthcare business and the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on April 29, 2024. On November 5, 2024, the court granted the motion in part, allowing the surviving claims to proceed to discovery. The Company believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claims in the amended complaint, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 
On May 1, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company, Linda McClellan, filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against certain of Masimo’s current and former executives and directors, and Masimo as nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to Masimo by allowing or permitting false or misleading statements to be disseminated regarding the performance of the Masimo’s healthcare business and the success of the Company’s legacy Sound United business. The complaint also asserts causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C.§ 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.

On May 16, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company, Dianne Himmelberger, filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (collectively, Derivative Actions). On July 22, 2024, the Court consolidated the Derivative Actions and stayed them until the motion to dismiss the Securities Class Action has been (i) denied in whole or in part, and no amended complaint is subsequently filed; or (ii) granted with prejudice, and any appeals pertaining to the motion to dismiss have concluded, or the time for seeking appellate review has passed with no further action from the Securities Class Action parties.
In August 2023, the Company determined to initiate a voluntary recall of select Rad-G
®
 products in connection with an issue that can result in an unintentional change in the power state of the device. On February 14, 2024, the Company initiated a voluntary recall. On February 21, 2024, the Company received a subpoena from the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking documents and information related to the Company’s Rad-G
®
 and Rad-97
®
 products, including information relating to complaints surrounding the products and the Company’s decision to recall the Rad-G
®
. On March 25, 2024, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C §§ 3729-3733, seeking documents and information related to customer returns of the Company’s Rad-G
®
 and Rad-97
®
 products, including returns related to the Company’s recall of select Rad-G
®
 products in 2024. The Company is investigating the reasons for the delay between August 2023 and February 2024 when the recall was initiated. The Company is cooperating with the government and may expend significant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoena and any related investigation or any other future requests for information.
The Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 26, 2024 seeking documents and information relating to allegations of potential accounting irregularities and internal control deficiencies from former employees within the Company’s accounting department.
With respect to each of the subpoenas and the investigative demand described above, the Company is cooperating with the government and may expend significant financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoenas and investigative demand and any related investigation or any other future request for information. In addition, requests and investigation of this nature may lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against the Company, which in turn may lead to material fines, penalties or other liabilities.
On July 15, 2024, the Company commenced litigation against Politan, including Mr. Koffey and Ms. Brennan, members of the Board, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California seeking, among other things, an order declaring that Politan’s proxy materials for the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), enjoining Politan from voting any proxies received by means of Politan’s misleading proxy materials, invalidating any proxies Politan obtained pursuant to the misleading proxy materials, and requiring Politan to correct material misstatements and omissions the proxy materials. On July 19, 2024, the Company filed a request for expedited discovery, which the District Court granted, and a motion for preliminary injunction. On August 26, 2024, the Company filed an amended complaint adding a claim that Politan had violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act for its disclosures related to its investment in the Company. The District Court denied the Company’s motion for a preliminary injunction after a hearing on September 9, 2024. On February 4, 2024, the District Court granted the Company’s request for dismissal of the case with prejudice.
On July 17, 2024, Politan commenced litigation against the Company, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek, members of the Board, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging that Mr. Kiani, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Chapek breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by moving the date of the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from July 25, 2024 to September 19, 2024, and seeking, among other things, the Company set the record date and hold the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as soon as possible, without further adjournment or postponement (Politan Chancery Litigation). On July 19, 2024, the Court of Chancery denied Politan’s request to reschedule the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to an earlier date. On October 25, 2024, Politan voluntarily dismissed the Politan Chancery Litigation without prejudice.
On September 19, 2024, at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company’s stockholder voted not to reelect Mr. Kiani to the Board. On September 19, 2024, after the conclusion of the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the Board starting his decision to resign from his position of CEO of the Company (the September 19 Notice). On September 23, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered a notification to the Board further describing his decision to resign (the September 23 Notice), and, on September 25, 2024, Mr. Kiani delivered an amended notification to the Board stating his decision to resign (the September 25 Notice, and, together with the September 19 Notice and the September 23 Notice, the Notice).
F-59

MASIMO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The Notice further states that Mr. Kiani’s resignation is for “Good Reason” (as such term is defined in Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement) and that the basis for his resignation for Good Reason is diminution of his “responsibilities, duties and authority as the Chairman of the Board and CEO” as defined in the Sections 2 and 7.4 of his amended Employment Agreement.
Additionally, on September 19, 2024, Mr. Kiani filed a claim in California Superior Court relating to his Amended Employment Agreement seeking, among other things, a declaratory relief that he had validly terminated his employment for “Good Reason”, and that he was entitled to certain benefits provided in the Amended Employment Agreement upon a termination for Good Reason, including the Special Payment. On October 31, 2024, Mr. Kiani filed an amended complaint, bringing additional claims for, among other things, breach of contract and violations of the California Labor Code.
The Company is evaluating the claim, and believes it has good and substantial defenses to the claims, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.
On October 24, 2024, the Company filed litigation against Mr. Kiani in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, seeking judicial declarations that numerous provisions in the Mr. Kiani’s Amended Employment Agreement, including the Special Payment, are invalid, unenforceable, and amount to a waste of corporate assets and, therefore, that Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment. The Company’s complaint alleges that Masimo’s directors at the time of the initial adoption of the Employment Agreement and subsequent amendments abdicated their fiduciary duties as a matter of Delaware law by approving the Amended Employment Agreement, which contained provisions intended to entrench Mr. Kiani in control of the Company indefinitely. Mr. Kiani filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 19, 2024.
Following an investigation by outside counsel, in which counsel collected and reviewed relevant documents, it was determined that the company had grounds to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment for cause. On October 24, 2024, the Board adopted resolutions to terminate Mr. Kiani’s employment for cause, effective October 24, 2024. The termination was not a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement). Consequently, the Company believes Mr. Kiani is not entitled to receive the Special Payment under the Amended Employment Agreement.
On October 25, 2024, the Company commenced litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Mr. Kiani, Roderick Wong, Naveen Yalamanchi, RTW Investment, LP, RTW Investments GP, LLC, RTW Master Fund, Ltd,. RTW Offshore Fund One, Ltd., RTW Onshore Fund One, LP, RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd,. RTW Innovation Offshore Fund, Ltd,. RTW Innovation Onshore Fund, LP, and RTW Fund Group GP, LLC, seeking disgorgement of short-swing profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (the SDNY Litigation). The Company filed an amended complaint in the SDNY Litigation on December 30, 2024. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the SDNY Litigation on January 23, 2025. In the SDNY Litigation, the Company alleges that the defendants formed a stockholder group under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act holding 10% or more of the Company’s common stock and engaged in short-swing trading between May and September 2024 as a part of an empty voting scheme to manipulate the vote in Mr. Kiani’s favor for the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company believes the total amount of RTW’s disgorgeable profits could be substantial.
For each of the foregoing matters, the Company is unable to determine whether any loss ultimately will occur or to estimate the range of such loss; therefore, no amount of loss accrued by the Company in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

25. Segment and Enterprise Reporting

The Company’s reportable segments are determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure and the way in which the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), the Company’s interim CEO (as of the end of fiscal year 2024), makes operating decisions, assesses financial performance, and allocates resources.
The 
two
 segments are:
•
Healthcare - develops, manufactures, and markets a variety of noninvasive monitoring technologies and hospital automation
®
 solutions and therapeutics. This segment includes the Company’s core legacy hospital business and new Masimo-technology-enabled consumer products that are distributed through many channels including e-commerce sites, leading national retailers and specialty chains globally.
•
Non-healthcare - designs, develops, manufactures, markets and sells a broad portfolio of premium, high-performance audio products and services, which is currently being evaluated for separation.
The Company’s CODM uses segment gross profit, as presented in the Company’s CODM reports, as the primary measure of segment profitability. The significant segment expenses help the Company to better understand operating results. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. For the year ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, intercompany revenues between healthcare and non-healthcare were $
4.9
 million and $
7.7
 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was 
no
 intercompany revenue between healthcare and non-healthcare. All inter-segment transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation for all periods presented below.
Selected information by reportable segment is presented below for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

26. Subsequent Event
On September 25, 2024, the Company announced that the Board remains committed to the previously announced review of alternatives for both the consumer audio and consumer healthcare businesses, and that the Board had engaged Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a legal advisor. As of year-end, the non-healthcare consumer audio products business remained part of the Company’s continuing operations and as an important part of the Company’s broader ecosystem. Subsequently, the sales process has progressed in 2025, and the Sound United business will be classified as held-for-sale and will be reported in discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2025.
