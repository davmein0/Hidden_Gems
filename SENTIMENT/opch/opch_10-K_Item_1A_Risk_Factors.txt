Governance
The Quality and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors provides board-level oversight of cybersecurity risk. 
As part of its oversight role, the Quality and Compliance Committee receives reports about our practices, programs, or notable threats or incidents related to cybersecurity throughout the year, including through periodic updates from our CISO and other leaders. The Quality and Compliance Committee provides regular reports to the full Board about these matters and other areas within its responsibility, and the CISO and other leaders provide updates regarding cybersecurity matters to the full 
Board
 as appropriate.
Our 
CISO
 reports to our Chief Information Officer and leads our overall cybersecurity function.

Our CISO has over 20 years of experience in various security roles, which include managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, and implementing cybersecurity programs.
 Our CISO collaborates with senior leaders and other members of our organization to identify and analyze cybersecurity risks and implement controls as appropriate and feasible to mitigate these risks. The CISO also supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, including by collaborating with internal and external stakeholders. Our CISO is supported by a management-led Security Council, which consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior leaders throughout our organization, and which reviews and discusses our cybersecurity program as well as emerging cyber risks, threats, and industry trends, among other topics.
