Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to assist the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year-to-year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements.
Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this Annual Report and specifically under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. In addition, the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 in this Annual Report.
Business Overview
Option Care Health and its wholly-owned subsidiaries provide infusion therapy and other ancillary healthcare services through a national network of 185 locations around the United States. The Company contracts with managed care organizations, third-party payers, hospitals, physicians, and other referral sources to provide pharmaceuticals and complex compounded solutions to patients for intravenous delivery in the patients’ homes or other non-hospital settings. Our services are provided in coordination with, and under the direction of, the patient’s physician. Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, including pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and respiratory therapists, work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to each patient’s specific needs. We provide home infusion services consisting of anti-infectives, nutrition support, therapies for neurological disorders and chronic inflammatory disorders, immunoglobulin therapy, and other therapies for chronic and acute conditions. The Company operates in one segment, infusion services.
Update on the Impact of the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident
As previously disclosed, on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, experienced an incident in which a cybersecurity threat actor gained access to some of its information technology systems (“Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident”). Since the time of the system disruption, Option Care Health has worked continuously to find alternative processes to help maintain patient care and overall operations.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not identified any compromise or unauthorized access of its systems or networks due to this third party incident. As of the end of the second quarter of 2024, the Company reconnected to key applications maintained by Change Healthcare and as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company has fully recovered.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company did not experience a material financial impact from the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident on the financial results as reported. The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity and, having resumed submission of all claims to payers, has determined that the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident did not materially impact the Company, including its business operations, financial condition or results of operations.

Table of Contents
Composition of Results of Operations
The following results of operations include the accounts of Option Care Health and our subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Gross Profit
Gross profit represents our net revenue less cost of revenue.
Net Revenue
. Infusion and related healthcare services revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from third-party payers and patients for goods sold and services rendered. When pharmaceuticals are provided to a patient, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the goods. When nursing services are provided, revenue is recognized when the services are rendered.
Due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time goods or services are provided. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payers may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.
Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue consists of the actual cost of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies dispensed to patients. In addition to product costs, cost of revenue includes warehousing costs, purchasing costs, depreciation expense relating to revenue-generating assets, such as infusion pumps, shipping and handling costs, and wages and related costs for the pharmacists, nurses, and all other employees and contracted workers directly involved in providing service to the patient.
The Company receives volume-based rebates and prompt payment discounts from some of its pharmaceutical and medical supplies vendors. These payments are recorded as a reduction of inventory and are accounted for as a reduction of cost of revenue when the related inventory is sold.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries for administrative employees that directly and indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. 
Depreciation within this caption relates to property and equipment and amortization relates to intangibles. Depreciation of revenue-generating assets, such as infusion pumps, is included in cost of revenue.
32
Table of Contents
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Expense, Net
. Interest expense consists principally of interest and fee payments on the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, First Lien Term Loan, Revolver Facility, Senior Notes, amortization of discount and deferred financing fees, payments associated with the interest rate cap, and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below for further discussion of these outstanding borrowings.
Equity in Earnings of Joint Ventures
. Equity in earnings of joint ventures consists of our proportionate share of equity earnings or losses from equity investments in two infusion joint ventures with health systems.
Other, Net
. During the year ended December 31, 2024, other income (expense) primarily includes activity related to non-operating income and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, other income (expense) primarily includes the termination fee, net of merger-related expenses, received on behalf of Amedisys, Inc. (“Amedisys”). On May 3, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Amedisys Merger Agreement”) with Amedisys, a leading provider of healthcare in home health and hospice settings. On June 26, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the Amedisys Merger Agreement (the “Mutual Termination Agreement”). Under the terms of the Mutual Termination Agreement, the Company received a payment of $106.0 million in cash on behalf of Amedisys (the “Termination Fee”).
Income Tax Expense
. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states. The Company’s income tax expense is reflective of the current federal and state tax rates.
Change in Unrealized (Loss) Gain on Cash Flow Hedge, Net of Income Tax Benefit (Expense)
. Change in unrealized (loss) gain on cash flow hedge, net of income tax benefit (expense), consists of the (loss) gain associated with the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments related to the interest rate cap, net of income taxes.

The increase in net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by organic growth in the Company’s portfolio of therapies, consisting of acute revenue that had high single digits growth relative to the prior year while chronic revenue grew in the high teens. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by the growth in revenue, therapy mix, and acute drug supply chain disruption, as well as the comparable impact of certain temporary favorable therapy procurement dynamics in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the launch of certain new higher cost therapies included within chronic growth (including rare and orphan therapies) and to the same comparable impact of certain temporary favorable procurement dynamics in the prior year that did not continue into 2024. Additionally, the Company received notice of a manufacturer’s intention to significantly reduce the spread at which the Company procures a certain therapy relative to drug reference prices beginning in early 2025, which is expected to negatively impact gross profit by approximately $60 million to $70 million in 2025.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in salaries, benefits, and general costs to support the business; however, these expenses have declined as a percentage of revenue to 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 14.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the Company’s focus on leveraging existing infrastructure to control spending.

The decrease in interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to additional interest income generated from our cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in the Company’s First Lien Term Loan principal balance, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 11,

, of the consolidated financial statements for further information.
The decrease in other, net during the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to the $106.0 million payment received on behalf of Amedisys, under the terms of the Mutual Termination Agreement, net of merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $71.8 million and $91.7 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 25.3% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The variance in the Company’s effective tax rate of 25.3% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributable to the difference in state taxes, various non-deductible expenses, and a change in state valuation allowance. The variance in the Company’s effective tax rate of 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the federal statutory rate of 21%, was also primarily attributable to state taxes, various non-deductible expenses, and a change in state valuation allowance. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $21.8 million of tax expense related to the Termination Fee received, under the terms of the Mutual Termination Agreement, net of merger-related expenses, and the release of $5.8 million of state valuation allowance in September 2023.

There was no comparable activity during the year ended December 31, 2024.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the change in unrealized (loss) gain on cash flow hedge, net of income tax benefit (expense) was related to the change in fair market value of the $300.0 million interest rate cap hedge executed in October 2021.
Net comprehensive income decreased to $207.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net comprehensive income of $260.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the changes in net income discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $412.6 million and $343.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $395.9 million of borrowings available under its credit facilities (net of $4.1 million undrawn letters of credit issued and outstanding), described further below. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s positive cash flows from operations have enabled investments in pharmacy, infusion suites, and information technology infrastructure to support growth and create additional capacity in the future, as well as to pursue acquisitions and share repurchases.
The Company’s primary uses of cash and cash equivalents include supporting our ongoing business activities, investment in capital expenditures in both facilities and technology, and the pursuit of acquisitions and share repurchases. Ongoing operating cash outflows are associated with procuring and dispensing drugs, personnel and other costs associated with servicing patients, as well as paying cash interest on outstanding debt and cash taxes. Ongoing investing cash flows are primarily associated with capital projects and business acquisitions, the improvement and maintenance of our pharmacy facilities and investment in our information technology systems. Ongoing financing cash flows are primarily associated with the quarterly principal payments on its outstanding debt, along with potential future share repurchases.
Our business strategy includes the deployment of capital to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing operations. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and view acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy. The Company historically has funded its acquisitions with cash and cash equivalents with the exception of the Merger. The Company may require additional capital in excess of current availability in order to complete future acquisitions. It is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions, and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on acceptable terms.
Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements
The Company’s ability to make principal and interest payments on any borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash and cash equivalents in the future, which to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on our current level of operations and planned capital expenditures, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and expected cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond. We may require additional borrowings under our credit facilities and alternative forms of financings or investments to achieve our longer-term strategic plans.

Credit Facilities
On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2021 (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment, among other things, (i) provides for an additional $50.0 million of incremental First Lien Term Loan indebtedness and (ii) reduces the interest rate on the First Lien Term Loan from Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (including a credit spread adjustment) plus 2.75% to Term SOFR plus 2.25% and removes the credit spread adjustment with respect to such First Lien Term Loan.
The principal balance of the First Lien Term Loan is repayable in quarterly installments of $1.6 million plus interest, with a final payment of all remaining outstanding principal due on October 27, 2028. The quarterly principal payments commenced in March 2022. Under the Third Amendment, interest on the First Lien Term Loan is payable monthly on either (i) SOFR (with a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus an applicable margin of 2.25% for Term SOFR Loans (as such term is defined in the Third Amendment); or (ii) a base rate determined in accordance with the Third Amendment, plus 1.25% for Base Rate Loans (as such term is defined in the Third Amendment).
On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into the second amendment to the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2021 (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment, among other things, provides for revolving credit commitments by the applicable Revolving Credit Lenders in an aggregate amount of $400.0 million (the “Revolver Facility”) pursuant to which such lenders have agreed to make Revolving Credit Loans to the Company. The Revolver Facility matures on the date that is the earlier of (i) December 7, 2028 and (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date applicable to any Term B Loans. Borrowings under the Revolver Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) the Term SOFR applicable thereto plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) the then-applicable Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, which Applicable Rate shall be, subject to certain caveats thereto, as follows (i) until delivery of financial statements and related Compliance Certificate for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the effective date of the Second Amendment, (A) for Term SOFR Loans, 1.75%, or (B) for Base Rate Loans, 0.75% and (ii) thereafter, the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Loans and Base Rate Loans, based upon the Total Net Leverage Ratio as set forth in the most recent Compliance Certificate received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4.1 million of undrawn letters of credit issued and outstanding, resulting in net borrowing availability under the Revolver Facility of $395.9 million.
The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.375% per annum, which are payable semi-annually in arrears on October 31 and April 30 of each year, and which began on April 30, 2022. The Senior Notes mature on October 31, 2029.
Interest payments over the course of long-term debt obligations total an estimated $271.1 million based on final maturity dates of the Company’s credit facilities. Interest payments are calculated based on current rates as of December 31, 2024.  Actual payments are based on changes in SOFR and exclude the interest rate cap derivative instrument.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the $106.0 million payment received on behalf of Amedisys, under the terms of the Mutual Termination Agreement, net of merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in accounts receivable and accrued compensation and employee benefits. Additionally, changes in accounts payable and inventory were driven by organic growth in the Company as well as strategic supply chain purchases. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to prior year acquisition activity with no comparable activity during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 3, 
Business Acquisitions and Divestitures
, of the consolidated financial statements for more information.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to the Company’s debt refinancing in May 2024, in which $50.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt was received, which partially offset $250.0 million in repurchase of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas the cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the Company’s $250.0 million repurchase of common stock.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period presented. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates, and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates.
The following discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the accounting policies, estimates or judgments made in the preparation of our financial statements. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
Net revenue is reported at the net realizable value amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services. Revenues are from commercial payers, government payers, and patients for goods and services provided and are based on a gross price based on payer contracts, fee schedules, or other arrangements less any implicit price concessions.
Due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time goods or services are provided. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. 
The Company assesses the expected consideration to be received at the time of patient acceptance based on the verification of the patient’s insurance coverage, historical information with the patient, similar patients, or the payer. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by the Company. The majority of the Company’s performance obligations are to provide infusion services to deliver medicine, nutrients, or fluids directly into the body. 
The Company provides a variety of infusion-related therapies to patients, which frequently include multiple deliverables of pharmaceutical drugs and related nursing services. After applying the criteria from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”), the Company concluded that multiple performance obligations exist in its contracts with its customers. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone price, determined based on reimbursement rates established in the third-party payer contracts. Pharmaceutical drug revenue is recognized at the time the pharmaceutical drug is delivered to the patient, and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service.
The Company’s accounts receivable are reported at the net realizable value amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services, which is inclusive of adjustments for price concessions. The majority of accounts receivable are due from private insurance carriers and governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Price concessions may result from patient hardships, patient uncollectible accounts sent to collection agencies, lack of recovery due to not receiving prior authorization, differing interpretations of covered therapies in payer contracts, different pricing methodologies, or various other reasons. 
Included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled gross receivables. Delays ranging from one day up to several weeks between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payer-specific documentation from internal and external sources.
After applying the criteria from ASC 606, an allowance for doubtful accounts is established only as a result of an adverse change in the payers’ ability to pay outstanding billings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company recorded an allowance for implicit price concessions based on its historical experience of additional revenue being recorded or revenue being written off when amounts received are greater than or less than the originally estimated net realizable value. The detailed assessments included, among other factors, current over/under payments which had not yet been applied to an account, historical contractual adjustments, and historical payments. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled.

Table of Contents
Business Acquisitions
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations 
(“ASC 805”), with assets and liabilities being recorded at their acquisition date fair values and goodwill being calculated as the purchase price in excess of the net identifiable assets. The application of ASC 805 requires management to make estimates and assumptions when determining the acquisition date fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Management’s estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the future cash flows an asset is expected to generate and the weighted-average cost of capital. See Note 3, 
Business Acquisitions and Divestitures
, for further discussion of business acquisitions.
Item 7A.    
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s primary market risk exposure is to changing SOFR‑based interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding debt of $631.6 million under our First Lien Term Loan with a variable interest rate component. See Note 11, 
Indebtedness
, of the consolidated financial statements for more information.
To reduce interest rate risk, the Company has utilized an interest rate derivative contract to hedge against fluctuations in SOFR rates on the First Lien Term Loan. In conjunction with the October 2021 debt refinancing, the Company entered into an interest rate cap hedge with a notional amount of $300.0 million for a five-year term, effective on November 30, 2021. See Note 12, 
Derivative Instruments
, of the consolidated financial statements for more information.
A hypothetical 100-basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates associated with the unhedged variable-rate debt over a 12-month period would result in a change to interest expense of approximately $3.3 million.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Option Care Health, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Option Care Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Sufficiency of audit evidence over the evaluation of transaction price adjustments
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, net revenue is reported at the net realizable value amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing goods and services. Revenues are from commercial payers, government payers, and patients for infusion therapy and other ancillary health care services. The Company estimates the transaction price adjustments based on the verification of the patient’s insurance coverage, historical price concessions, and historical payments.  
We identified the sufficiency of audit evidence over the evaluation of transaction price adjustments as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained due to the large volume of data and information technology (IT) applications utilized in the transaction price adjustment process to capture and aggregate the data.  
43
Table of Contents
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s transaction price adjustment process, including general IT controls and IT application controls. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in the identification and testing of certain IT systems used by the Company for processing and recording of transaction price adjustments. We tested the relevance and reliability of the underlying data that served as the basis for the transaction price adjustments by agreeing a selection of certain data elements to underlying support. We assessed the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to transaction price adjustments by evaluating the cumulative results of the audit procedures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Corporate Organization and Business 
— The Company’s stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, HC Group Holdings I, LLC. (“HC I”), a former affiliated shareholder, completed sales of

Basis of Presentation 
— The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. GAAP
 requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in determining assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. Actual amounts could differ materially from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation 
— The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Option Care Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company has investments in companies that are 
50
% owned and are accounted for as equity-method investments. The Company’s share of earnings from equity-method investments is included in the line entitled “Equity in earnings of joint ventures” in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See “Equity-Method Investments” within Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
— The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash equivalents consisted of money market funds.
Accounts Receivable
 — The Company’s accounts receivable are reported at the net realizable value amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services, which is inclusive of adjustments for price concessions. The majority of accounts receivable are due from private insurance carriers and governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Price concessions may result from patient hardships, patient uncollectible accounts sent to collection agencies, lack of recovery due to not receiving prior authorization, differing interpretations of covered therapies in payer contracts, different pricing methodologies, or various other reasons. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”), an allowance for doubtful accounts is established only as a result of an adverse change in the Company’s payers’ ability to pay outstanding billings.
 In addition, the company assesses if there have been any changes to historical credit losses to determine if an allowance for credit losses is needed. The Company had an immaterial allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled gross receivables of $
105.3
 million and $
89.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Delays ranging from one day up to several weeks between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payer-specific documentation from internal and external sources.
See 
Revenue Recognition
 for a further discussion of the Company’s revenue recognition policy.
Inventories 
— Inventories, which consist primarily of pharmaceuticals, is stated at the lower of first‑in, first‑out cost or net realizable value basis, which the Company believes is reflective of the physical flow of inventories.
Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets 
— Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are rebates receivable from pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers of $
54.4
 million and $
52.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Leases 
— The Company has lease agreements for facilities, warehouses, office space and property and equipment. At the inception of a contract, the Company determines if the contract is a lease or contains an embedded lease arrangement. Operating leases are included in the operating lease right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
ROU assets, which represent the Company’s right to use the leased assets, and operating lease liabilities, which represent the present value of unpaid lease payments, are both recognized by the Company at the lease commencement date. The Company utilizes its estimated incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of unpaid lease obligations. The rates are estimated primarily using a methodology dependent on the Company’s financial condition, creditworthiness, and availability of certain observable data. In particular, the Company considers its actual cost of borrowing for collateralized loans and its credit rating, along with the corporate bond yield curve in estimating its incremental borrowing rates. ROU assets are recorded as the amount of operating lease liability, adjusted for prepayments, accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of the ROU asset. Tenant improvement allowances used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce the related ROU asset. Tenant improvement allowances are recognized through the ROU asset as a reduction of expense over the term of the lease.
Leases may contain rent escalations; however, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The Company reviews the terms of any lease renewal options to determine if it is reasonably certain that the renewal options will be exercised. The Company has determined that the expected lease term is typically the minimum non-cancelable period of the lease.
The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
 See Note 8, 
Leases
, for further discussion of leases.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Property and Equipment, and Referral Sources 
— Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill under ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles
-
Goodwill and Other. 
The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Company completes its goodwill impairment test annually in the fourth quarter on a qualitative basis. See Note 10, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, for further discussion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets.
Intangible assets arising from the Company’s acquisitions are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Referral sources have a useful life of 
fifteen
 to 
twenty years
. Trademarks/names have a useful life ranging from 
two
 to 
fifteen years
. The useful lives for other amortizable intangible assets range from approximately 
two
 to 
nine years
. The Company does not have any indefinite‑lived intangible assets.
Property and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on owned property and equipment is provided for on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the estimated useful life of the property or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives are 
seven years
 for infusion pumps and 
three
 to 
thirteen years
 for equipment. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized in the property and equipment accounts. Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Computer software is included in property and equipment and consists of purchased software and internally-developed software. The Company capitalizes application-stage development costs for significant internally-developed software projects. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the software’s estimated useful life, generally 
five years
. Costs recognized in the preliminary project phase and the post-implementation phase, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.
The Company assesses long‑lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. If circumstances require that a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Equity-Method Investments 
— The Company’s investments in certain unconsolidated entities are accounted for under the equity method. The balance of these investments is included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of the investments was $
24.5
 million and $
20.9
 million, respectively. The investments are increased to reflect the Company’s capital contributions and equity in earnings of the investees. The investments are decreased to reflect the Company’s equity in losses of the investees and for distributions received that are not in excess of the carrying amount of the investments. The Company’s proportionate share of earnings or losses of the investees is recorded in equity in earnings of joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The Company’s proportionate share of earnings was $
6.0
 million, $
5.5
 million and $
5.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Distributions from the investees are treated as cash inflows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company received distributions from the investees of $
2.4
 million, $
4.0
 million and $
5.9
 million, respectively. See Note 17, 
Related-Party Transactions
, for discussion of related-party transactions with these investees.
Hedging Instruments 
— The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit its exposure to increases in the interest rate of its variable rate debt instruments. The derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. See Note 12, 
Derivative Instruments,
 for additional information.
At inception of the hedge, the Company designated the derivative instruments as a hedge of the cash flows related to the interest on the variable rate debt. For all instruments designated as hedges, the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk management objective of the hedging relationship. For all hedging instruments, the terms of the hedge perfectly offset the hedged expected cash flows.

Revenue Recognition 
— Net revenue is reported at the net realizable value amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing goods and services. Revenues are from government payers, commercial payers, and patients for goods and services provided and are based on a gross price based on payer contracts, fee schedules, or other arrangements less any implicit price concessions.
Due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time goods or services are provided. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available.
The Company assesses the expected consideration to be received at the time of patient acceptance, based on the verification of the patient’s insurance coverage, historical information with the patient, similar patients, or the payer. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by the Company. The majority of the Company’s performance obligations are to provide infusion services to deliver medicine, nutrients, or fluids directly into the body.
The Company provides a variety of infusion-related therapies to patients, which frequently include multiple deliverables of pharmaceutical drugs and related nursing services. After applying the criteria from ASC 606, the Company concluded that multiple performance obligations exist in its contracts with its customers. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone price, determined based on reimbursement rates established in the third-party payer contracts. Pharmaceutical drug revenue is recognized at the time the pharmaceutical drug is delivered to the patient, and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service. 
The Company's outstanding performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year. Therefore, the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient provided by ASC 606 and is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. Any unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of a reporting period are generally completed prior to the patient being discharged.
 See Note 4, 
Revenue 
for a further discussion of revenue.
Cost of Revenue 
— Cost of revenue consists of the actual cost of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies dispensed to patients, as well as all other costs directly related to the production of revenue. These costs include warehousing costs, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, wages and related costs for pharmacists and nurses, along with depreciation expense relating to revenue-generating assets, such as infusion pumps.
The Company also receives rebates from pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers. Rebates are generally volume-based incentives and are recorded as a reduction of inventory and are accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
— Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries for administrative employees that directly and indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.

Stock Based Incentive Compensation
 — The Company accounts for stock-based incentive compensation expense in accordance with ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation
 (“ASC 718”). Stock-based incentive compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock unit awards using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. For awards with a service-based vesting condition, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award. For awards with performance-based vesting conditions, the Company will recognize expense when it is probable that the performance-based conditions will be met. When the Company determines that it is probable that the performance-based conditions will be met, a cumulative catch-up of expense will be recorded as if the award had been vesting on a straight-line basis from the award date. The award will continue to be expensed on a straight-line basis through the remainder of the vesting period and will be updated if the Company determines that there has been a change in the probability of achieving the performance-based conditions. The Company records the impact of forfeited awards in the period in which the forfeiture occurs.
Business Acquisitions
 — The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
, with assets and liabilities being recorded at their acquisition date fair value and goodwill being calculated as the purchase price in excess of the net identifiable assets.
 See Note 3, 
Business Acquisitions and Divestitures
, for further discussion of the Company’s business acquisitions.

Table of 
Contents
Income Taxes 
— The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported for book-tax basis differences and are measured based on currently enacted tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rate on deferred taxes is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.
The Company recognizes income tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained on their technical merits. The Company measures recognized income tax positions at the maximum benefit that is more likely than not, based on cumulative probability, realizable upon final settlement of the position. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in income tax expense (benefit). Tax related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense (benefit).
Concentrations of Business Risk 
— The Company generates revenue from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial third-party payers. Revenue related to the Company’s largest payer was approximately 
15
%, 
14
% and 
14
% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no other managed care contracts that represent greater than 10% of revenue for the years presented.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 
12
%, 
12
% and 
12
%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue was reimbursable through direct government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
11
% and 
12
%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable was related to these programs. Governmental programs pay for services based on fee schedules and rates that are determined by the related governmental agency. Laws and regulations pertaining to government programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change in the near term.
The Company does not require its patients nor other payers to carry collateral for any amounts owed for goods or services provided. Other than as discussed above, concentrations of credit risk relating to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the Company’s diversity of patients and payers. Further, the Company generally does not provide charity care; however, Option Care Health offers a financial assistance program for patients that meet certain defined hardship criteria.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 
58
% of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical supply purchases were from three vendors. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 
72
% and 
73
%, respectively, of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical supply purchases were from four vendors. Although there are a limited number of suppliers, the Company believes that other vendors could provide similar products on comparable terms. However, a change in suppliers could cause delays in service delivery and possible losses in revenue or decreased gross profit, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or operating results.
Fair Value Measurements 
— The fair value measurement accounting standard, ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
 (“ASC 820”), provides a framework for measuring fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The standard establishes a valuation hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on independent market data sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available. The valuation hierarchy is composed of three categories. The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The categories within the valuation hierarchy are described as follows:
•
Level 1 - Inputs to the fair value measurement are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 - Inputs to the fair value measurement include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 - Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.
While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of

different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
— In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. This ASU improves the disclosures around a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions (such as cost of sales, SG&A, and research and development). The amendments in this ASU do not change or remove current presentation requirements or current expense disclosure requirements. However, the amendments affect where this information appears in the notes to financial statements because entities are required to include certain current disclosures in the same tabular format disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements in the amendments. The Company is required to adopt this ASU for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. This ASU addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The ASU allows investors to better assess, in their capital allocation decisions, how an entity’s worldwide operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its income tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. This ASU also improves the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by adding disclosures of pretax income (loss) and income tax expense (benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-X and removing disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant. The Company is required to adopt this ASU for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This ASU improves the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The ASU improves financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities, including those public entities that have a single reportable segment, to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The Company is required to adopt this ASU for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This ASU was adopted during the year ended December 31, 2024 and applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption did not have any material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial position, or disclosures. See Note 18, 
Segment Reporting
, for further discussion.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, 
Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
. This ASU is the result of the Board’s decision to incorporate into the Codification 14 disclosures referred by the SEC. The ASU represents changes to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Topics. Many of the amendments allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the SEC’s requirements. Also, the amendments align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption permitted. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and disclosures.

% and 
25.5
% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is also primarily attributable to the difference in state taxes, various non-deductible expenses, and a change in state valuation allowance.

The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $
21.8
 million of tax expense related to the Termination Fee payment received on behalf of Amedisys, under the terms of the Mutual Termination Agreement, net of merger-related expenses. In September 2023, the Company released $
5.8
 million of state valuation allowance. The variance in the Company’s effective tax rate of 
25.5
% and 
26.8
% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is primarily attributable to the difference in state taxes, various nondeductible expenses, and a change in state valuation allowance.

Deferred tax assets are generally required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $
3.3
 million against certain state net operating losses (“NOL”). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, including the effect in available carryback and carryforward periods, projected taxable income and tax-planning strategies, in making this assessment. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in determining if the valuation allowance is fairly stated.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
35.6
 million of tax-effected federal NOL carryforwards all of which are currently available to offset future taxable income in the United States and reflected as a deferred tax asset of the company. Tax-effected federal NOL carryforwards of $
24.6
 million expire beginning in 2028 through 2036, and $
11.0
 million of tax-effected federal NOLs have an indefinite carryforward period. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
5.8
 million tax-effected amounts of interest limitation carryforwards which have an indefinite carryforward period. At December 31, 2024, the Company also had $
15.3
 million tax-effected amounts of cumulative state NOL carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in various states. These state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2025 through 2043, with some having an indefinite carryforward period.
At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. Tax related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share for its common stock. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income of the Company by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the effects of all potentially dilutive securities.
The earnings are used as the basis of determining whether the inclusion of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive. The computation of diluted shares for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 includes the effect of shares that would be issued in connection with warrants, stock options, restricted stock awards and performance stock unit awards, as these common stock equivalents are dilutive to the earnings per share.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include: a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; the loss of key personnel; a change in reporting units; the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; and the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit.
A qualitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth quarter of 2024, 2023 and 2022, to assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying value. The Company assessed relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the Company’s stock price. The Company determined that there was 
no
 goodwill impairment in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
The determination of fair value for acquisitions and the allocation of that value requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures. Actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company did not recognize any accumulated impairment losses at the beginning of the period.
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill consist of the following activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2021. The Third Amendment, among other things, (i) increases borrowings by $
50.0
 million and (ii) reduces the interest rate on the First Lien Term Loan from Term SOFR (including a credit spread adjustment) plus 
2.75
% to Term SOFR plus 
2.25
% and removes the credit spread adjustment with respect to such First Lien Term Loan.
The principal balance of the First Lien Term Loan is repayable in quarterly installments of $
1.6
 million plus interest, with a final payment of all remaining outstanding principal due on October 27, 2028. The quarterly principal payments commenced in March 2022. Under the Third Amendment, interest on the First Lien Term Loan is payable monthly on either (i) SOFR (with a floor of 
0.50
% per annum) plus an applicable margin of 
2.25
% for Term SOFR Loans (as such term is defined in the Third Amendment); or (ii) a base rate determined in accordance with the Third Amendment, plus 
1.25
% for Base Rate Loans (as such term is defined in the Third Amendment). The interest rate on the First Lien Term Loan was 
6.82
% and 
8.21
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average interest rate incurred on the First Lien Term Loan was 
7.61
% and 
7.83
% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company assessed whether the repayment of the First Lien Term Loan indebtedness resulted in an insubstantial modification or an extinguishment of the existing debt for each loan in the syndication by grouping lenders as follows: (i) Lenders participating in both the First Lien Term Loan and Senior Notes; (ii) previous lenders that exited; and (iii) new lenders. The Company determined that $
0.4
 million of the First Lien Term Loan were extinguished. The First Lien Term Loan had insubstantial modifications for lenders that participated in both debt instruments, which resulted in a cash inflow from financing activities of $
50.0
 million in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company incurred $
1.6
 million in fees, of which $
0.1
 million was capitalized, relative to the First Lien Term Loan and an immaterial amount of the total fees incurred was netted against the $
50.0
 million of debt proceeds as financing activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
0.4
 million included in the line entitled “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Effective June 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement, dated as of June 8, 2023, to amend the First Lien Term Loan to replace LIBOR and related definitions and provisions with SOFR as the new reference rate. The Company entered into the First Lien Term Loan Agreement (the “First Lien Credit Agreement Amendment”), which commenced in October 2021 (the “October 2021 Refinancing”) to provide $
600.0
 million of refinanced borrowings.

Table of 
Contents
On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2021. The Second Amendment, among other things, creates a Revolver Facility which provides for borrowings up to $
400.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
4.1
 million of undrawn letters of credit issued and outstanding, resulting in net borrowing availability under the Revolver Facility of $
395.9
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
5.3
 million of undrawn letters of credit issued and outstanding, resulting in net borrowing availability under the Revolver Facility of $
394.7
 million. The Revolver Facility matures on the date that is the earlier of (i) December 7, 2028 and (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date applicable to any Term B Loans. Borrowings under the Revolver Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) the Term SOFR applicable thereto plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) the then-applicable Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, which Applicable Rate shall be, subject to certain caveats thereto, as follows (i) until delivery of financial statements and related Compliance Certificate for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the effective date of the Second Amendment, (A) for Term SOFR Loans, 
1.75
%, or (B) for Base Rate Loans, 
0.75
% and (ii) thereafter, the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Loans and Base Rate Loans, based upon the Total Net Leverage Ratio as set forth in the most recent Compliance Certificate received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Concurrently with the creation of the Revolver Facility, the Company terminated the asset-based lending revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) with a maturity date of October 27, 2026. Prior to the transition to the Revolver Facility, the ABL Facility had been in effect from August 6, 2019 to December 7, 2023. Effective January 13, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the ABL Facility and increase the amount of borrowing availability from $
175.0
 million by $
50.0
 million to $
225.0
 million total borrowing availability. As a result of the amended agreement, SOFR was established as the new reference rate, replacing LIBOR. Prior to the termination of the ABL Facility in December 2023, the ABL Facility bore interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either (i) a base rate determined in accordance with the ABL Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin, which is equal to between 
0.25
% and 
0.75
% based on the historical excess availability as a percentage of the Line Cap (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement); and (ii) SOFR (with a floor of 
—
% per annum) plus an applicable margin, which is equal to between 
1.25
% and 
1.75
% based on the historical excess availability as a percentage of the Line Cap. The ABL Facility contained commitment fees payable on the unused portion ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.375
%, depending on various factors including the Company’s leverage ratio, type of loan and rate type, and letter of credit fees of 
2.50
%. Borrowings under the ABL Facility were secured by a first priority security interest in the Company’s and each of its subsidiaries’ inventory, accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts and certain assets and property related thereto (the “ABL Priority Collateral”), in each case subject to certain exceptions, and a third priority security interest in each of the Company’s subsidiaries’ capital stock (subject to certain exceptions) and substantially all of the Company’s property and assets (other than the ABL Priority Collateral).
In conjunction with the October 2021 Refinancing, the Company also issued $
500.0
 million in aggregate principal of unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 
4.375
% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on October 31 and April 30 of each year, commencing on April 30, 2022. The Senior Notes mature on October 31, 2029. The interest rate on the Senior Notes was 
4.375
% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The weighted average interest rate incurred on the Senior Notes was 
4.375
% for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to limit the Company’s exposure to its variable interest rate risk. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging strategies subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company’s exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including reviewing credit ratings when appropriate.
In October 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate cap hedge with a notional amount of $
300.0
 million for a 
five-year
 term beginning November 30, 2021. The hedge partially offsets risk associated with the First Lien Term Loan’s variable interest rate. The interest rate cap instrument perfectly offsets the terms of the interest rates associated with the variable interest rate of the First Lien Term Loan.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value measurements are determined by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The hierarchy places the highest priority on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined in Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of

different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
First Lien Term Loan
: The fair value of the First Lien Term Loan is derived from a broker quote on the loans in the syndication (Level 2 inputs). See Note 11, 
Indebtedness
, for further discussion of the carrying amount and fair value of the First Lien Term Loan.
Senior Notes
: The fair value of the Senior Notes is derived from a broker quote (Level 2 inputs). See Note 11, 
Indebtedness
, for further discussion of the carrying amount and fair value of the Senior Notes.
Interest Rate Cap
: The fair value of the interest rate cap is derived from the interest rates prevalent in the market and future expectations of those interest rates (Level 2 inputs). The Company determines the fair value of the investments based on quoted prices from third-party brokers. See Note 12, 
Derivative Instruments
, for further discussion of the fair value of the interest rate cap.
Money Market Funds
: The fair value of the money market funds is derived from the closing price reported by the fund sponsor and classified as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (Level 1 inputs).
There were no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2024 or 2023.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries, and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Company’s business. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company may also be involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property, and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.
The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. The Company does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines, and rulings may occur. As a result, the Company may from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

The 2018 plan is administered by the Company’s Compensation Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Directors. In May 2024, an additional 
4,000,000
 shares were authorized for issuance under the amended 2018 Plan, resulting in a total of

four-year
 period and, in certain instances, may fully vest upon a change in control of the Company. The options also typically have an exercise price that may not be less than 100% of its fair market value on the date of grant and are exercisable 
seven
 to 
ten years
 after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination in certain circumstances.
Compensation expense from stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized compensation expense related to stock options of $
5.9
 million, $
6.5
 million and $
2.5

15.72
 and $
12.51
, respectively. The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model.

Performance Stock Units 
— Performance-based stock units (“PSU”) are generally earned based on the attainment of specified goals achieved over a designated performance period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee approved PSU awards to certain senior executives of the Company with grant dates in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All PSU awards offer a 
three-year
-cliff vesting schedule. Each PSU award reflects a target number of shares (“Target Shares”) that may be issued to the award recipient. PSU awards may be earned upon the completion of a 
two-year
-average or 
three-year
-average performance period.
Whether PSU awards are earned at the end of the performance period will be determined based on the achievement of certain performance objectives over the performance period. The performance objectives include achieving a target growth for adjusted EBITDA and revenue combined in addition to a target growth for cash flows from operations over the performance period. Depending on the results achieved during the performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the Target Shares granted. Each period begins with 
100
% of the Target Shares and true-up or true-down adjustments are considered every quarter-end based on the forecasted performance period results.
The fair value of the Target Shares and PSU awards are based on the fair value of the underlying shares as of market close on the grant date. Compensation expense for PSU awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the PSU awards of $
8.8
 million, $
7.5
 million and $
4.1
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, shares were surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the performance-based stock units with a cost basis of $

SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company has adopted ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
and has revised prior year disclosures to conform with the current year presentation. The Company operates as a single reportable segment, infusion services. Infusion services derives revenue through the clinical management of infusion therapy, nursing support and care coordination in order to provide solutions to complex patient conditions in the home or other nonhospital settings. The Company’s infusion services segment activities are managed on a consolidated basis and therapies are distributed and administered in a similar manner.
Operating segments have been identified based on the financial information utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM uses net income as a measure of profitability to assess segment performance and deciding on how to allocate resources such as capital investments, share repurchases, and acquisitions. The CODM does not use or receive total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Our management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Option Care Health, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
