Our Commercialized Products
Neuroscience
Our Sleep Products
.  We are the leader in the development and commercialization of oxybate therapy for patients with sleep disorders.  Xyrem was approved by FDA in 2002, and is indicated for treating cataplexy and EDS in patients seven years of age or older with narcolepsy.  In 2020, we received FDA approval for Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy.  In August 2021, Xywav became the first and only therapy approved by FDA for the treatment of IH in adults.  Xywav is an oxybate therapy that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem.  Xywav has become a standard of care for patients with narcolepsy and IH.
Xywav
.  In July 2020, FDA approved Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in patients seven  years of age and older with narcolepsy.  Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.  Since there is no cure for narcolepsy and long-term disease management is needed, we believe that Xywav represents an important therapeutic option for patients with this sleep disorder.  Narcolepsy affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the U.S., with symptoms typically appearing in childhood.  There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.  While patients with narcolepsy may not experience all five symptoms, EDS, an essential symptom of narcolepsy, is present in all narcolepsy patients and is characterized by chronic, pervasive sleepiness as well as sudden irresistible and overwhelming urges to sleep (inadvertent naps and sleep attacks).  Narcolepsy may affect many areas of life, including limiting a patient’s education and employment opportunities, and may lead to difficulties at work, school, or in daily life activities like driving, operating machinery or caring for children.  Patients with narcolepsy may also suffer from significant medical comorbidities in both adult and pediatric populations, including increased psychiatric comorbidity (including anxiety disorders and mood disorders), intentional self-injury, attempted suicide, suicide-related mortality,  other sleep disorders (such as periodic limb movement disorder), cardiovascular disorders (such as hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure), and metabolic disorders (such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes). 
Cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness, can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy.  Cataplexy is present in approximately 70% of patients with narcolepsy.  Cataplexy can range from slight weakness or a drooping of facial muscles to the complete loss of muscle tone resulting in postural collapse.  It may also impair a patient’s vision or speech.  Cataplexy is often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise.  Cataplexy can severely impair a patient’s quality of life and ability to function.
Narcolepsy patients, by virtue of their diagnosis, are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and disease, and the impact of sodium on cardiovascular health is well established.  There is also extensive scientific evidence that reducing sodium consumption, which is a modifiable risk factor, is associated with clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk.  Therefore, we believe that reducing sodium intake compared to currently-marketed high-sodium oxybate products by 92% each day is a significant advancement for these patients.  The 92% reduction of sodium translates into a reduction of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 milligrams per day for a patient prescribed high-sodium oxybate, depending on the dose.  Our commercial efforts are focused on educating patients and physicians about the lifelong impact of high sodium intake, and how the use of Xywav enables them to address what is a modifiable risk factor.  When patients transition from Xyrem to Xywav, Xywav treatment is initiated at the same dose and regimen (gram for gram) and titrated as needed based on efficacy and tolerability.  
We view the adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy as a positive indication that physicians and patients appreciate the benefits of a low-sodium oxybate option.  In June 2021, FDA recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav in narcolepsy through July 21, 2027 (which was subsequently extended to January 21, 2028).  Nevertheless, Lumryz, a fixed-dose, high-sodium oxybate, was approved by FDA on May 1, 2023 for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and was launched in the U.S. market in June 2023.  FDA continues to recognize seven years of ODE for Xywav in narcolepsy.  In connection with granting ODE for Xywav, FDA stated that “Xywav is clinically superior to Xyrem by means of greater safety because Xywav provides a greatly reduced chronic sodium burden compared to Xyrem.”  FDA's summary also stated that “the differences in the sodium content of the two products at the recommended doses will be clinically meaningful in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in a substantial proportion of patients for whom the drug is indicated.”  FDA has also recognized that the difference in sodium content between Xywav and Lumryz is likely to be clinically meaningful in all patients with narcolepsy and that Xywav is safer than Lumryz in all such patients.  Lumryz has the same sodium content as Xyrem.  Xywav is the only approved oxybate therapy that does not carry a warning and precaution related to high sodium intake.
On August 12, 2021, FDA approved Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults.  Xywav remains the first and only FDA-approved therapy to treat IH.  We initiated the U.S. commercial launch of Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults on November 1, 2021.  In January 2022, FDA recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav in IH through August 12, 2028.  IH is a debilitating neurologic sleep disorder characterized by chronic EDS (the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in the irrepressible need to sleep or unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness), severe sleep inertia, and prolonged and

non-restorative nighttime sleep.  
Although there are overlapping clinical features with other conditions, including narcolepsy, IH has its own specific diagnostic criteria.  IH can significantly affect social, educational and occupational functioning.
  An estimated 37,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with IH and are actively seeking healthcare.  
We have agreements in place for Xywav with all three major PBMs in the U.S.  To date, we have entered into agreements with various entities and have achieved benefit coverage for Xywav in both narcolepsy and IH indications for approximately 90% of commercial lives.
We have seen strong adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy since its launch in November 2020 and increasing adoption in IH since its launch in November 2021.  In 2024, net product sales of Xywav were $1,473.2 million, which represented 39% of our total net product sales for the year.  
Xyrem.  
Xyrem was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy in 2002 and was approved for treatment of EDS in patients with narcolepsy in 2005.  In October 2018, Xyrem was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in pediatric patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy.
In 2024, net product sales of Xyrem were $233.8 million, which represented 6% of our total net product sales for the year. 
Xywav and Xyrem REMS
.  Our marketing, sales and distribution of Xywav and Xyrem in the U.S. are subject to a REMS, which is required by FDA to mitigate the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, abuse, misuse and diversion of Xywav and Xyrem.  The Xywav and Xyrem REMS has the same requirements for both products.  Under this REMS, all of the Xywav and Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be dispensed and shipped directly to patients or caregivers through a central pharmacy.  Xywav and Xyrem may not be stocked in retail pharmacies.  Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of Xywav and Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient must receive materials concerning the serious risks associated with Xywav and Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product.  The central certified pharmacy must monitor and report instances of patient or prescriber behavior giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of abuse, misuse or diversion of Xywav and Xyrem, and maintains enrollment and prescription monitoring information in a central database.  The central pharmacy ships the product directly to the patient (or caregiver) by a courier service. 
Since 2002, we have had exclusive agreements with ESSDS, the central pharmacy for Xywav and Xyrem, to distribute Xywav and Xyrem in the U.S. and provide patient support services related to Xyrem.  In December 2022, we entered into new agreements with ESSDS with a two-year term and our ability to extend the term for an additional year.  Our current agreements with ESSDS, which expire on December 31, 2025, may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party.
Epidiolex. 
 We acquired Epidiolex (Epidyolex outside the U.S.) in May 2021 as part of our GW Acquisition, which expanded our growing neuroscience business with a global, high-growth childhood-onset epilepsy franchise.  Epidiolex was approved in the U.S. in June 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, LGS and DS, in patients two years of age and older, and subsequently approved in July 2020 for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in patients one year of age and older.  FDA also approved the expansion of the other approved indications, LGS and DS, to patients one year of age and older.  In September 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization under the trade name Epidyolex for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with LGS or DS, in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.  Epidyolex is now launched in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.  The
 clobazam restriction is limited to the EU and 
Great Britain
.
  Epidyolex was also approved for adjunctive therapy in seizures associated with TSC for patients 2 years of age and older in the EU in April 2021 and Great Britain in August 2021, and is approved for this indication in other markets.  Epidiolex/Epidyolex is also approved in markets including Switzerland, Israel, Canada, and Australia.  See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of clinical development activities for Epidiolex. 
LGS and DS are severe childhood-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes.  LGS and DS affect approximately 35,000-50,000 and approximately 10,000 individuals in the U.S., respectively.  TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes non-malignant tumors to form in many different organs and is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy.  TSC affects approximately 50,000 individuals in the U.S.  Epidiolex has received ODE to treat seizures associated with LGS and DS through 2025 and TSC through 2027.

and adult patients one month and older who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase.  Rylaze is the only recombinant Erwinia asparaginase manufactured product that maintains a clinically meaningful level of serum asparaginase activity throughout the entire intended course of treatment.  We developed Rylaze to address the needs of patients and health care providers for an innovative, high-quality Erwinia asparaginase with reliable supply.  See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of clinical development activities for Rylaze.
The initial approved recommended dosage of Rylaze was for an IM administration of 25 mg/m
2
 every 48 hours.  In November 2022, FDA approved an sBLA, for a Monday/Wednesday/Friday 25/25/50 mg/m

 IM dosing schedule.  In September 2023, the EC granted marketing authorization for JZP458 (Rylaze) under the trade name Enrylaze.  Enrylaze was approved in Great Britain in January 2024, and is approved in other markets. 
In 2024, net product sales of Rylaze were $410.8 million, which represented 11% of our total net product sales for the year. 
Zepzelca.
  We acquired U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca in early 2020, and launched six months thereafter, with an indication for treatment of patients with SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.  Zepzelca is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues within DNA.  This triggers a cascade of events that can affect the activity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription factors, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in disruption of the cell cycle and eventual cell death.  Our education and promotional efforts are focused on SCLC-treating physicians.  We are continuing to raise awareness of Zepzelca across academic and community cancer centers. 
Our exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca were acquired through an exclusive license agreement we entered into with PharmaMar in December 2019.  In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with PharmaMar to expand our exclusive license to include rights to develop and commercialize Zepzelca in Canada.  The term of the amended license agreement extends on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of: (i) expiration of the last PharmaMar patent covering Zepzelca in that country (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Zepzelca in that country and (iii) 12 years after the first commercial sale of Zepzelca in that country.  We have the right to terminate the amended license agreement at will upon a specified notice period, and either party can terminate the amended license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. 
Zepzelca was granted orphan drug designation for adults with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy by FDA in August 2018.  In December 2019, PharmaMar submitted an NDA, to FDA for accelerated approval of Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC based on data from a Phase 2 trial, and in February 2020, FDA accepted the NDA for filing with priority review.  In June 2020, FDA granted accelerated approval of Zepzelca for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.  Zepzelca is approved based on response rate and duration of response.  In collaboration with Roche, we have an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for Zepzelca for use as maintenance therapy in first-line extensive-stage SCLC in combination with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) following induction therapy with carboplatin, etoposide and Tecentriq.  In October 2024, we announced positive top-line results from the trial showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for Zepzelca and atezolizumab in combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  We plan to submit a sNDA in the first half of 2025 to support approval of this combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  In addition, our licensor PharmaMar is conducting a confirmatory trial in second-line SCLC.  This is a three-arm trial comparing Zepzelca as either monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan to investigator's choice of irinotecan or topotecan.  Data from either the first-line maintenance trial of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq or the PharmaMar trial could serve to confirm clinical benefit of Zepzelca and support full approval in the U.S.  See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of clinical development activities for Zepzelca.
In 2024, net product sales of Zepzelca were $320.3 million, which represented 8% of our total net product sales for the year. 
Ziihera
.  We acquired our exclusive development and commercialization rights to Ziihera in 2022 through a licensing agreement with a subsidiary of Zymeworks providing development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab across all indications in the U.S., Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks.  The term of the license agreement extends on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such licensed product in such country.  We have the right to terminate the license agreement at will upon a specified notice period, and either party can terminate the license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.
Ziihera is a bispecific HER2-directed antibody that binds to two extracellular sites on HER2.  Binding of zanidatamab-hrii with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the tumor cell surface.  In the U.S., Ziihera is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) BTC, as detected by an FDA-approved test.  Ziihera was launched in December 2024.

In 2024, net product sales of Ziihera were $1.1 million, which represented less than 1% of our total net product sales for the year.
Revenue Diversification
As part of our objective to build a durable, growing commercial portfolio and reduce business risk by diversifying our revenue sources, we have been actively seeking to expand our commercial portfolio thorough a combination of launching internally developed therapies and commercial assets or investigational therapies acquired through corporate development.  In 2020, 74% of total revenue was generated by one product, the high-sodium oxybate Xyrem.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, 11% of total revenue was generated by Xyrem plus high-sodium oxybate AG royalty revenue.

Research and Development Progress 
Our research and development activities encompass all stages of development and currently include clinical testing of new product candidates and activities related to clinical improvements of, or additional indications or new clinical data for, our existing marketed products.  We also have active preclinical programs for novel therapies, including neuroscience and precision medicines in oncology.  We are increasingly leveraging our growing internal research and development function, and we have also entered into collaborations with third parties for the research and development of innovative early-stage product candidates and have supported additional investigator-sponsored trials that are anticipated to generate additional data related to our products.  We also seek out investment opportunities in support of the development of early- and mid-stage technologies in our therapeutic areas and adjacencies.  We have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements with third parties, including biotechnology companies, academic institutions and research-based companies and institutions, related to preclinical and clinical research and development activities in hematology and in precision oncology, as well as in neuroscience. 
Oncology
Zanidatamab
.  Zanidatamab is a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, known as biparatopic binding.  Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials as a treatment for patients with HER2-expressing cancers.  In November 2024, we announced that zanidatamab had been approved by FDA for treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) BTC, as detected by an FDA-approved test.  We have an ongoing Phase 3 randomized clinical trial evaluating zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy plus or minus tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for HER2-expressing GEA, an ongoing Phase 2 trial examining zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy in first-line patients with HER2-expressing metastatic GEA and an ongoing Phase 3 trial examining zanidatamab in first-line patients with HER2-positive BTC.  There are also multiple ongoing clinical trials exploring zanidatamab in breast cancer and other HER2-expressing tumor types.
Zepzelca
.  Our development plan for Zepzelca continues to progress.
In collaboration with Roche, we have an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in use as maintenance therapy in first-line extensive-stage SCLC of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq
®
 (atezolizumab).  In October 2024, we announced positive top-line results from the trial showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for Zepzelca and atezolizumab in combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  In addition, our licensor PharmaMar is conducting a confirmatory trial in second-line SCLC.  This is a three-arm trial comparing Zepzelca as either monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan to investigator's choice of irinotecan or topotecan.  Data from either the first-line maintenance trial of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq or the PharmaMar trial could serve to confirm clinical benefit of Zepzelca and support full approval in the U.S.
We have an ongoing Phase 4 observational study to collect real world safety and outcome data in adult Zepzelca monotherapy patients with SCLC who progress on or after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.
JZP815
.  JZP815 is a pan-RAF kinase inhibitor that targets specific components of the MAPK pathway that, when activated by oncogenic mutations, can be a frequent driver of human cancer.  In October 2022, we enrolled our first patient in a Phase 1 study to investigate the safety, dosing, and initial antitumor activity of JZP815 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring alterations in the MAPK pathway.
JZP898.  
JZP898 is a differentiated, conditionally-activated IFNα INDUKINE™ molecule.  We acquired rights to JZP898 from Werewolf in 2022 under an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Werewolf's investigational WTX-613, now referred to as JZP898.  In November 2023, we enrolled our first patient in a Phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of JZP898 both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. 
Neuroscience

Epidiolex.
  We have an ongoing Phase 3 trial of Epidyolex for LGS, DS and TSC in Japan.  In August 2024, we announced top-line results from the trial.  The trial did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of a pre-specified percentage change in indication-associated seizure frequency during the treatment period (up to 16 weeks) compared to baseline in Japanese pediatric patients; however, numeric improvements were observed in the primary and several secondary endpoints.  No new safety signals were observed in the trial.  We are continuing to collect data in Japanese patients and plan to engage with regulatory authorities in Japan regarding a potential new drug application.
JZP441
.  JZP441 is a potent, highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist with potential application for the treatment of narcolepsy, IH and other sleep disorders.  In May 2022, we announced that we had entered into a licensing agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Europe and other territories for DSP-0187, now referred to as JZP441.  Sumitomo initiated a Phase 1 trial in Japan in November 2021 to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of JZP441 in healthy volunteers.  In November 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 development 
17
Table of Contents
program to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JZP441 in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers.  In November 2023, we announced that the study achieved proof of concept in healthy volunteers based on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test and that the program was being paused as we analyzed safety findings related to visual disturbances and cardiovascular effects; no liver toxicity signals were observed.  Following additional review of the trial findings and input from FDA, we plan to initiate a small Phase 1b trial of JZP441 in narcolepsy Type 1 patients in 2025.  We expect data from this trial will further our understanding of JZP441 and orexin-2 receptor agonism, providing learnings that could inform potential future development efforts.  
We are also pursuing early-stage activities related to the development of JZP324, an extended-release low sodium oxybate formulation that we believe could provide a clinically meaningful option for patients with serious sleep disorders.
Preclinical

Through third parties, we are also pursuing oncology and neuroscience preclinical and clinical research and development activities under a number of licensing and collaboration agreements, including with:
•
XLp for rights to use XLp’s PASylation
®
 technology to extend the plasma half-life of selected asparaginase product candidates; 
•
Redx for preclinical collaboration activities related to the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway program that we purchased from Redx;
•
We are also evaluating the use of our CombiPlex delivery technology platform in a number of therapeutic formulations and combinations in oncology as part of our internal oncology research and development activities; and 
•

Commercialization Activities
We have direct Jazz commercial operations in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada and a network of commercial distributors that represent our commercial interests in other key markets across the globe.  In the U.S., our products are commercialized through a number of teams, including a team of experienced, trained sales professionals who provide education and promote Xywav, Epidiolex, Zepzelca, Rylaze, Ziihera, Vyxeos and Defitelio to healthcare providers in the appropriate specialties for each product.  In addition, we have a team that interacts with payors and institutions to ensure access and coverage for the products, as well as Xyrem, and a team that distributes the products throughout the U.S. healthcare system (wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals, and community and academic institutions) and provides patient services.
In Canada and in approved markets in Europe and Australia where we commercialize Defitelio and Vyxeos, we have a field force of hematology sales specialists.  In markets where these products either are not approved or are unable to be promoted under local regulation, we have medical affairs personnel responsible for responding to medical information requests and for providing information consistent with local treatment protocols with respect to such products.  In certain European markets and Australia, we have a sales team and a team of medical science liaisons supporting our commercialization of Epidyolex.  In addition, we directly market Xywav, Xyrem and Rylaze in Canada.
Other commercial activities include marketing related services, pricing and access, industry analytics and insights, distribution services and commercial support services.  We employ third party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities.  We also provide reimbursement and patient assistance support for our U.S. markets.
We intend to scale the size of our sales force as appropriate to effectively reach our target audience in the specialty markets in which we currently operate.  We promote Zepzelca, Rylaze, Vyxeos, Defitelio and Ziihera to many hematology and oncology specialists who operate in the same hospitals and outpatient clinical sites, and we believe that we benefit from

operational synergies from this overlap.  Continued growth of our current marketed products and the launch of any future products may require a reevaluation of our field force and support organization in and outside the U.S.
High Performance Organization and Human Capital Management
We are committed to creating a high performing company where the culture embodies our corporate purpose to innovate to transform the lives of patients and reflects our key goals: (1) be a purpose-driven, people-centric, and great place to work and (2) live our core values of Integrity, Collaboration, Passion, Innovation, and Pursuit of Excellence.  
Employee Demographics
.  As of December 31, 2024, Jazz employed approximately 2,800 people worldwide, of which approximately 50% were employed in the U.S. and approximately 50% were employed outside the U.S., primarily in the U.K., Ireland and across the EU.  As an innovative biopharmaceutical company, we have over 740 employees — representing approximately 27% of our global workforce — supporting our research and development activities.  We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Company Culture
.  We believe a culture rooted in purpose, centered on people, and focused on performance is key to unlocking our full potential and achieving sustainable success.  By prioritizing a people-centric and performance-based approach, we aim to create a workplace where purpose fuels passion, leading to innovative solutions and exceptional business outcomes. 
We aim to create an environment where our employees live our core values to unlock the full potential of our people as a key to driving business performance.  We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all employees feel they belong, which in turn brings a variety of perspectives that drive innovation and business success.  We strive to create a workplace culture that fosters the ability of our employees to be their authentic selves and contribute boldly.  Our belonging and inclusion strategy includes: (1) cultivating a workforce that reflects unique backgrounds, experiences, and talents and represents the varied perspectives of the patients and customers we serve; (2) investing in talent development and ensuring equal opportunities for all; and (3) creating a culture of inclusion and belonging.  As of December 31, 2024,  
•
50% of our board of directors and 56% of our executive committee is diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity and/or sexual orientation.   
•
Women represent 55% of our global workforce and 46% at the leadership level (employees at executive director and above). 
•
In the U.S., people of color represent 35% of our U.S. workforce and 20% at the leadership level.  
We believe an employee population that reflects the communities that we serve and a culture that fosters belonging and inclusion leads to innovation, employee engagement, and strong business performance.  We have created various employee resource groups with membership open to all employees consisting of three ConcERTos, and six Affinity Forums representing the wide variety of backgrounds of our employees and providing a platform for broader company engagement and education.  Our ConcERTos and Affinity Forums were established as broad self-led teams of employee volunteers with varied backgrounds and perspectives with the aim of connecting Jazz employees with similar visions and interests in inclusive, welcoming, and collaborative settings.  As of the end of 2024, 37% of our global workforce were active in at least one of these groups. 
While we are proud of what we have accomplished to date, we remain committed to our aspiration of providing an inclusive and high-performing workplace that is supportive of all backgrounds, including among our broader leadership. 
Employee Engagement
.  We have a strong employee value proposition anchored in our shared commitment to our purpose to innovate to transform the lives of patients and their families.  We believe employee engagement and the power of our employee voices is foundational to employee belonging and strong performance.  We have transparent and regular communication channels with our employees consisting of many forms – including all employee meetings, regular communication messages from executive leadership, town halls, top leadership forums, pulse check feedback mechanisms and employee feedback surveys.   
Our employee feedback surveys are designed to help us measure overall employee engagement as well as gather insights on other important areas of our employee experience, and we consistently achieve participation rates above 75%.  We consistently have high levels of engagement as measured by employees’ feelings of connection to our purpose, a sense of belonging, as well as Jazz being considered a good place to work by our employees.  We continue to focus on  high-performance practices we have deemed critical, such as decision-making, planning and prioritizing work, speaking up and constructive challenge, accountability, and a growth mindset.  Our survey informs programs and activities aligned with achieving our corporate objectives and achieving our goal of evolving our operating culture for agility and scalability. 
Our Community Beat ConcERTo is made up of employee volunteer teams that promote company culture and create a sense of belonging and camaraderie among our employees.  They organize programs and engagement activities on a local level to connect employees with the company strategy and business goals, support local communities, and promote employee health

and well-being initiatives.  They play a pivotal role in fostering community within our working model by engaging remote employees and maximizing connection during times together at our sites and offices.   
Growth, Development and Total Rewards
.  Our talent strategy focuses on attracting the best talent, recognizing and rewarding the performance of our employees as defined by both what they accomplished and how they accomplished it, and continually developing our talent through new experiences and learning opportunities.  We believe there is ample opportunity for growth and development at Jazz and there is not a one size fits all approach to growing our talent.  We strive to create the best career experience for all of our employees and encourage them to have regular dialogue with their leadership to create meaningful career development plans.  
Our performance management process supports our culture of continual feedback and coaching, and ongoing growth and development through new experiences and learning.  We encourage all employees to have an individual development plan to outline learning and growth interests and focus areas.   
We leverage digital learning platforms to provide on demand, bite-sized learning to all employees that can be accessed 24/7 on a range of topics from leadership, personal effectiveness and well-being.  In addition, we provide a number of self-service learning resources via our intranet site on topics such as High-Performance Teamwork, Decision Making, Hybrid Working, and Digital Skills development.  We continue to offer tuition reimbursement in our major markets aimed at growth and career development.  
In 2024, we continued to focus on developing the capabilities of our Global Leadership Team (Top 80 leaders) to build leadership excellence, strengthen relationships, and encourage cross functional collaboration in pursuit of our enterprise strategic goals.  Our focus in 2024 was on building people manager excellence and behaviors linked to a high-performance culture, e.g., how to create an environment where people feel able to constructively challenge one another. 
Our management and leadership teams place significant focus and attention to capability development and succession planning for critical roles.  We regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions to successfully maintain business operations and develop a pipeline of talent.   
We provide our employees with what we believe to be market competitive and locally relevant compensation and benefits that support our overarching strategy to attract, retain and reward highly talented employees in an extremely competitive and dynamic industry.  This includes broad-based participation in our annual incentive plan, which rewards employees based on the company’s achievement of pre-established goals (or sales targets in the case of sales incentive plans) as well as performance against their personal objectives and our long-term equity incentive plans, which fosters an ownership culture and provides eligible employees with the opportunity to share in the long-term success they help create.  
Fundamental to creating a high performing company is our commitment to building and maintaining a culture of health and wellbeing throughout the organization.  We do this by supporting employees and their families through access to a suite of innovative programs that inspire them to focus on their mind, body, finances and work/life balance.     
•
We provide a robust set of offerings centered on mental and emotional health, including resilience, stress management, mindfulness and managing clinical conditions.  
•
We offer programs that promote activity, healthy nutrition habits, chronic condition prevention and early detection of more serious disease/illness.  
•
We offer an enhanced suite of global paid leave and other time-off polices to address the differing needs of our employee population through varying stages of life, including minimum standards for new parent leave (irrespective of gender or how a family is created), family caregiver leave and bereavement leave.  We offer a global volunteer day to provide employees time off with full pay to give back to their communities.  
•
Our Wellbeing Reimbursement Account reimburses employees for a wide array of expenses that support their overall wellbeing, empowering them to choose what is most important to them. 
•
In 2025, we will hold our first-ever Jazz Wellbeing Week, providing dedicated time off to all employees to focus on wellbeing and self-care. 
Employee Care
.  We are committed to providing a great workplace experience where people feel invested in, valued and cared for, and a sense of belonging.  We strive to enable our employees to live into our values and support one another while doing everything we can to deliver on our patient mission.  Important to this are leader expectations and tools given the rise and complexity of emerging employee demands and needs – including more flexibility to address personal needs, a greater connection to understand the whole person and their lives, and creating supportive and productive work environments for people to thrive.  We provide productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely, including training and toolkits to help leaders effectively lead and manage remote teams; increased flexibility within work schedules and leave programs to support employees caring for children and others; expanded employees assistance and mindfulness programs 
21
Table of Contents
to help employees and their families manage anxiety, stress, and overall wellbeing; and increased investment in resources focused on inclusion and belonging.  
Through direct input from employees, external insights and best practices, we developed our flexible working model; expanding the power of intentional collaboration and our ability to more effectively manage our global and highly distributed team workforce.  This approach to work, called “Jazz Remix,” aims to provide eligible employees with the greatest flexibility and agility to globally connect, collaborate, innovate and perform. 
Environment, Health and Safety
.  Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Ireland, the U.K. and Italy where we have manufacturing facilities.  Our manufacturing activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents.  Environmental and health and safety authorities in Ireland, the U.K. and Italy administer laws governing, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public.  In certain cases, such laws, directives and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste.  Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste.  In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.  
We seek to operate our manufacturing facilities in an environmentally responsible way to protect our people, our business, our environment and the local communities in which we operate.  In light of the potential impact of our business on the environment, we have adopted a number of internal environmental policies and management systems designed to manage our operations in compliance with applicable laws, directives and regulations on environmental protection and in support of environmental sustainability and local biodiversity.  Our environmental policies and management systems include procedures for assessing compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and reporting incidents of non-compliance to applicable governmental authorities.  For example, we have environmental policies governing our manufacturing facilities in Ireland, the U.K. and Italy, which demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability and require us to minimize resource use (e.g., energy and water) and waste generation, optimize the use of raw materials, and undertake continuous improvement in environmental performance, with an emphasis on pollution prevention. 
Competition 
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive.  Our products compete, and our product candidates may in the future compete, with currently existing therapies, product candidates currently under development by us and others and/or future product candidates, including new chemical entities that may be safer, more effective or more convenient than our products.  Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our competitors, which include large global pharmaceutical companies and small research-based companies and institutions, may succeed in developing products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.
With respect to competition we face from generic drugs, certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available.  Generic competition often results in decreases in the net prices at which branded products can be sold. 
In particular, our products and most advanced product candidates face or may face competition as described below: 
•
Xywav and Xyrem
.  Xywav and Xyrem are approved by FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy.  We and others have launched products to treat EDS in narcolepsy and may in the future launch products to treat cataplexy in narcolepsy that are competitive with or disrupt the market.  Xywav and Xyrem face competition from Avadel’s Lumryz, a branded product for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy.  Lumryz, a once-nightly dose, high-sodium oxybate, was launched in the U.S. market in June 2023.  We and Avadel are engaged in various litigation regarding Lumryz and our oxybate products.  We cannot at this time predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the litigation or the impact of the litigation on our sleep products, Xywav and Xyrem.  For additional information on litigation involving this matter, see “
FDA Litigation
” and “
Avadel Litigation
” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
In addition, since January 2023 our oxybate products have faced competition from AG high-sodium oxybate pursuant to a settlement agreement we entered into with an ANDA filer, and since July 2023, an additional AG version of 
22
Table of Contents
high-sodium oxybate from a volume-limited ANDA filer.  Collectively, these AG versions of high-sodium oxybate have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to negatively impact Xyrem and Xywav sales for patients with narcolepsy.  Specifically, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma launched its AG version of high-sodium oxybate in January 2023 and Amneal launched its AG version of high-sodium oxybate in July 2023.  Hikma has elected to continue to sell the Hikma AG product, with royalties to be paid to us, for a total of up to four years beginning in January 2024, which election may be terminated by Hikma in accordance with the notice provisions in the agreements between the parties.  We have the right to receive a meaningful royalty from Hikma on net sales of the Hikma AG product; the royalty rate was fixed for the second half of 2023.  There was also a substantial increase in the royalty rate beginning in January 2024, which will remain fixed for the duration of the agreement's term.  For a description of generic versions of sodium oxybate and/or new products for the treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS that currently compete or could in the future compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, Xywav and Xyrem, as well as a description of our settlement agreements with ANDA filers, see the risk factor under the heading “
The introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect sales of our oxybate products” 
in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  
In addition, Xywav and Xyrem may face competition in the future from other new sodium oxybate formulations for treatment of narcolepsy.  Also, in the future we expect competition from generic versions of sodium oxybate.  For example, we received notices in June 2021 and February 2023, that Lupin and Teva, respectively, filed ANDAs for generic versions of Xywav.  On October 13, 2023, Lupin announced that it has received tentative approval for its application to market a generic version of Xywav.  
Non-oxybate products intended for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy or IH (Xywav is the first and only FDA-approved therapy to treat IH), including new market entrants, even if not directly competitive with Xywav or Xyrem, could have the effect of changing treatment regimens and payor or formulary coverage of Xywav or Xyrem in favor of other products, and indirectly materially and adversely affect sales of Xywav and Xyrem.  Xywav and Xyrem face competition from Sunosi, which we sold to Axsome in 2022.  Xywav and Xyrem may face increased competition from new branded entrants to treat EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy such as pitolisant, which has been approved by FDA for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy.  Harmony Biosciences has announced a phase 3 study for pitolisant for IH after receiving a refusal to file from FDA in February 2025.  Other companies have announced that they have product candidates in various phases of development to treat the symptoms of narcolepsy, such as Axsome’s reboxetine, and various companies are performing research on orexin agonists for the treatment of sleep disorders, including Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Merck & Co., Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and Alkermes plc. 
In addition, we are also aware that prescribers often prescribe branded or generic medications for cataplexy and IH before prescribing or instead of prescribing oxybate therapy, and that payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xywav or Xyrem, even if they are not approved for this use.  For example, prescribers often treat mild cataplexy with drugs that have not been approved by FDA for this indication, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.  We are also aware that branded or generic stimulants may be prescribed off-label for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy.  Wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil, including both branded and generic equivalents, are approved for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and other conditions, and may be used in conjunction with or instead of Xywav or Xyrem.  
•
Epidiolex
.  Patients in the U.S. suffering from seizures associated with DS, LGS or TSC are treated with a variety of FDA-approved products, including clobazam, clonazepam, valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, rufinamide, topiramate, ethosuximide, and zonisamide.  FDA approved Zogenix, Inc.'s low-dose fenfluramine in DS in June 2020, and for LGS in March 2022.  In March 2022, UCB S.A. announced that it had completed its acquisition of Zogenix.  FDA approved Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 deficiency disorder in March 2022.  Ovid Therapeutics Inc./Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Eisai Company Limited and H Lundbeck A/S are developing therapies for treating Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (includes DS and LGS).  Stiripentol has been approved in Europe for several years to treat DS and was approved in 2018 by FDA.  Harmony Biosciences is developing a topical formulation of CBD for which it is working with FDA on a path forward on CONNECT-FX data for Zygel in Fragile X syndrome.  There are a number of public and private companies in various stages of developing genetic therapies for DS, including Stoke Therapeutics, Inc., which has an antisense oligonucleotide, STK-001, in clinical trials.
In addition, there are non-FDA approved CBD preparations being made available from companies in the medical marijuana industry, which might attempt to compete with Epidiolex.  While federal law prohibits the sale and distribution of most marijuana products not approved or authorized by FDA, the vast majority of states and the 
23
Table of Contents
District of Columbia have legalized either CBD or marijuana for either recreational or medical use, or both.  Under the U.S. Farm Bill, enacted in late 2018, certain extracts and other material derived from cannabis are no longer controlled under the CSA.  However, the marketing of such products as a food, dietary supplement, or for medical purposes remains subject to FDA requirements.  With respect to the marketing of CBD as a food or dietary supplement, in January 2023 FDA concluded that the existing regulatory frameworks for foods and supplements were not appropriate for CBD products and denied three citizen petitions that had asked the agency to conduct rulemaking to allow the marketing of CBD products as dietary supplements.  In addition, Congressional efforts related to legalization of marijuana continue.  Although our business is distinct from that of entities marketing FDA-unapproved marijuana and CBD-containing dietary supplements, future legislation or federal government action authorizing the sale, distribution, use, and insurance reimbursement of non-FDA approved marijuana or CBD products could increase competition for and adversely affect our ability to generate sales of Epidiolex and our cannabinoid product candidates.
We are aware of exploratory research into the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, often referred to as THC, and CBD drug formulations; discovery research within the pharmaceutical industry into synthetic agonists and antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors; companies that supply synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis extracts to researchers for pre-clinical and clinical investigation; and various companies that cultivate cannabis plants with a view to supplying herbal cannabis or nonpharmaceutical cannabis-based formulations to patients.  These activities have not been approved by FDA but may in the future compete with our products.
Moreover, we expect that Epidiolex will face competition from generic products in the future.  In November and December 2022, we received notices from various ANDA filers that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) oral solution.  In January 2023, we filed patent infringement suits against these ANDA filers.  For a description of this litigation, see “
Epidiolex Patent Litigation
” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  As a result of these lawsuits, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 30 months will be imposed by FDA on these ANDA filers.
•
Zepzelca.  
Zepzelca faces competition from topotecan, which is also an approved treatment in second line SCLC in the U.S., as well as other regimens for relapsed SCLC currently recommended in compendia guidelines, including rechallenge with first line platinum chemotherapy.  There are also a number of products and immunotherapies for the treatment of second line SCLC in various phases of development, including Amgen Inc.’s tarlatamab, which was approved for use in the U.S. in May 2024.  Moreover, we expect that Zepzelca will face competition from generic products in the future.  In July and August 2024, we received notices from various ANDA filers that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Zepzelca (lurbinectedin).  In September 2024, we filed patent infringement suits against these ANDA filers.  For a description of this litigation, see “
Zepzelca Patent Litigation
” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  As a result of these lawsuits, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 30 months will be imposed by FDA on these ANDA filers.
•
Rylaze.  
Rylaze may face competition from Erwinaze in the future.  Erwinaze was previously approved and commercialized by us as a treatment for ALL patients with hypersensitivity to 
E. coli
-derived asparaginase.  In April 2020, PBL granted Clinigen a global license for Erwinaze.  However, in December 2021, Clinigen announced that FDA issued a complete response letter to PBL’s BLA for Erwinaze, indicating that the BLA cannot be approved in its current form.  Outside of the U.S., Enrylaze faces competition from Erwinase.  Rylaze may also face competition from other companies who have developed or are developing new treatments for ALL.  In addition, some new asparaginase treatments could reduce the rate of hypersensitivity in patients with ALL, and new treatment protocols are being developed and approved for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens, including some for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL patients.
•
Vyxeos
.  With respect to Vyxeos, there are a number of alternative established therapies in AML.  A key consideration in the treatment of AML patients is the patient’s suitability for chemotherapy.  The AML patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA included 60-75 year old fit patients, or those deemed able to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy.  Prior to Vyxeos, the most widely recognized option for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC in fit patients was cytarabine in combination with daunorubicin, known as 7+3, which is still used today in this population, along with other intensive chemotherapy regimens, particularly in patients under the age of 60.  Also, since Vyxeos was approved, several other products have been approved by FDA or are in development as treatment options for newly diagnosed AML patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy, such as targeted agents (e.g. midostaurin, enasidenib and ivosidenib), immunotherapies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy), and agents disrupting leukemia cell survival (e.g., glasdegib).  We are also aware of the increasing use of venetoclax combined with either a hypomethylating 
24
Table of Contents
agent or low-dose cytarabine, a treatment approved by FDA in newly diagnosed AML patients who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.  With ongoing trends in the U.S. towards lower-intensity treatments and away from intensive chemotherapy regimens for AML, we note increasing competition from other therapeutic options as we continue to educate providers on the clinical benefits of Vyxeos in appropriate patients.
•
Defitelio
.  Defitelio is the first and only approved treatment for patients with VOD, sVOD, or VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets.  Utilization of Defitelio is in part driven by evolving treatment practices in HSCT.  While there is currently no direct competition to Defitelio to treat severe VOD, changes in the types of conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT may affect the incidence of VOD diagnosis and demand for Defitelio.  In December 2024, FDA accepted an ANDA for a generic version of Defitelio (defibrotide sodium).  We have yet to receive notice of this ANDA filing.
•
Ziihera
.  Ziihera faces competition from generic chemotherapies, including cisplatin/gemcitabine rechallenge, and other HER2 directed therapies, including Enhertu and trastuzumab.
An important part of our corporate strategy is to build a diversified product pipeline, including by acquiring or in-licensing and developing, or partnering to license and develop, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential.  Our ability to continue to grow our product portfolio requires that we compete successfully with other pharmaceutical companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources, to acquire or in-license products and product candidates.  
Customers 
In the U.S., Xywav and Xyrem are sold to one certified specialty pharmacy, ESSDS, that ships Xywav and Xyrem directly to patients.  Also in the U.S., Epidiolex is sold to specialty pharmacies, wholesalers and specialty distributors.  Defitelio is sold to hospital customers through subsidiary specialty distributors of McKesson.  Zepzelca, Rylaze, Vyxeos and Ziihera are sold to customers through subsidiary specialty distributors of McKesson, Cencora, and Cardinal.  We have distribution services agreements made in the ordinary course of business with McKesson, Cencora and Cardinal and a pharmacy services agreement with ESSDS.  For more information regarding our relationship with ESSDS, see “Business—Our Commercialized Products—Xywav and Xyrem REMS” in this Part I, Item 1.  Purchases are made on a purchase order basis. 
In certain countries in Europe, Defitelio and Vyxeos are sold pursuant to marketing authorizations.  We distribute these products through Durbin PLC, a U.K.-based wholesaler and distributor, and O&M Movianto Nederland BV, our centralized European logistics services provider, to hospitals and local wholesalers in Europe where we market these products directly and, in other markets in Europe and elsewhere where we do not market these products directly, to local distributors and wholesalers.  In certain countries in Europe, Epidyolex is sold pursuant to marketing authorizations.  We distribute Epidyolex through a variety of wholesalers and distributors.  In countries where there is no marketing authorization, Epidyolex is available pursuant to named patient programs, temporary use authorizations or similar authorizations in accordance with local regulations controlling the medical use of unapproved products.  
We commercialize and distribute Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.  Xyrem is also sold in certain countries outside the U.S. and Canada by UCB under the UCB license.  In July 2024, the parties agreed to terminate the UCB license.  UCB has up to two years from the execution of the termination agreement to withdraw the marketing authorization for Xyrem in all applicable territories.
Manufacturing 
We have a manufacturing and development facility in Athlone, Ireland where we manufacture Xywav and Xyrem, a manufacturing and development facility in Kent Science Park, U.K. where we produce Epidiolex/Epidyolex, and a manufacturing plant in Villa Guardia, Italy where we produce defibrotide drug substance.  We currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing or packaging capability for our other products, product candidates or their APIs.  As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends on third party suppliers being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs for API, other raw materials, packaging materials and finished products.  
Marketed Products
Xywav.
  Xywav is manufactured at our Athlone facility.  Xywav, like Xyrem, is a Schedule III controlled substance in the U.S.  The API of Xywav are the calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (as gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is the API for Xyrem), which are Schedule I controlled substances in the U.S.  As a result, Xywav and Xyrem are subject to regulation by the DEA under the CSA, and its manufacturing and distribution are highly restricted.  Quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture or procure calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in the U.S.  For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government

Regulation—Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1.
Xyrem.  
Xyrem is manufactured by us in our Athlone facility and by Patheon under the Patheon Agreement entered into with Patheon in 2015.  We manufacture Xyrem in our Athlone facility for most of our U.S. commercial supply and rely on Patheon to supply Xyrem for other markets, though we are not required to purchase Xyrem exclusively from Patheon.  The current term of the Patheon Agreement will expire in December 2026, subject to further automatic two-yearly extensions if Patheon is then providing manufacturing services for any product, unless either party provides prior notice of termination.  In addition, we may terminate the Patheon Agreement for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice.
Siegfried supply sodium oxybate, the API of Xyrem, to Patheon and our Athlone facility.  Although Siegfried has been our only supplier of sodium oxybate since 2012, we have the right to purchase a portion of our worldwide requirements of sodium oxybate from other suppliers.  The agreement with Siegfried expires in April 2027, subject to automatic three-year extensions until either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.  During the term of the agreement and, under certain circumstances for 18 months after the agreement terminates, Siegfried is not permitted to manufacture sodium oxybate for any other company.
Epidiolex.  
Epidiolex/Epidyolex is manufactured by us in our Kent Science Park facility in the U.K.  Epidiolex is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising highly purified plant-derived CBD.  We cultivate our cannabinoid plants in the U.K. under highly controlled and standardized conditions.
Zepzelca
.  Zepzelca is manufactured by Simtra.  The current term of the agreement with Simtra will expire in December 2025 and will then be subject to automatic two-year extensions, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.  PharmaMar retains manufacturing rights for the API for U.S. and Canadian commercial supply of Zepzelca.
Rylaze.
  Rylaze is currently manufactured by Patheon, and the API of Rylaze is manufactured by AGC Biologics A/S.  The initial term of the agreement with Patheon will expire in December 2025 and will then be subject to automatic two-year extensions, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.  The initial term of the agreement with AGC Biologics A/S will expire in October 2026 and will then be subject to automatic three-year extensions, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.
Vyxeos.  
Vyxeos is manufactured by Simtra, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location, using our CombiPlex technology platform.  CombiPlex products represent formulations with increased manufacturing complexities associated with producing drug delivery vehicles encapsulating two or more drugs that are maintained at a fixed ratio and, in the case of Vyxeos, two drugs that are co-encapsulated in a freeze-dried liposomal format.  Our manufacturing agreement with Simtra expires in August 2025, subject to automatic three-year renewal terms, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.  While other contract manufacturers may be able to produce Vyxeos, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable.  The marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos also requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments.
Defitelio.
  We are our own sole supplier of, and we believe that we are currently the sole worldwide producer of, defibrotide API.  We manufacture defibrotide API from porcine DNA in a single facility located in Villa Guardia, Italy.  Patheon currently processes defibrotide API into its finished vial form under a specific product agreement entered into under a separate agreement with Patheon.  Patheon is the sole provider of our commercial and clinical supply of Defitelio; however, we are not required to purchase Defitelio exclusively from Patheon.  If Patheon does not or is not able to supply us with Defitelio for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another processor, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from Defitelio and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.
Ziihera.  
Ziihera is manufactured by WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited at their manufacturing site in WuXi, China.  The initial term of the agreement with WuXi will expire in March 2029 and will then be subject to automatic three year extensions, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.  We have the right to appoint an alternate contract manufacturer at our discretion.
Product Candidates 
For discussion of the challenges we face with respect to supply of our products and product candidates, see the risk factor under the heading “
Delays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects”

Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek to patent, or to acquire or obtain licenses to third party patents, to protect our products and product candidates and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business.  We own a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of issued patents and patent applications.  Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, used to treat particular conditions, distribution methods and methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles and methods of making and use.  Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.  The patent laws of ex-U.S. countries differ from those in U.S., and the degree of protection afforded by ex-U.S. patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents.  In addition to patents, our products and product candidates are in some instances protected by various regulatory exclusivities.  For a description of those exclusivities and their regulatory background, see “Business—Government Regulation—Marketing Exclusivity—The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1.
The patents, patent applications and regulatory exclusivities that relate to our marketed products include:
•
Xywav. 
 We have 15 U.S. patents that relate to Xywav.  These patents expire from 2033 to 2041.  In addition, we have patent applications that relate to Xywav for use in additional indications that would, if issued, expire between 2040 and 2041.  Xywav has been granted ODE by FDA to treat narcolepsy through January 2028 (inclusive of six months of pediatric exclusivity) and to treat IH through August 2028.  Some of our Xywav patents have been subject to patent litigation with the companies who filed ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xywav.  For example, we received notices in June 2021 and February 2023, that Lupin and Teva, respectively, filed ANDAs for generic versions of Xywav.  For additional information on litigation involving these matters, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
•
Xyrem
.  We currently have seven issued patents in the U.S. relating to Xyrem listed in the Orange Book.  Our patents relate to a DDI between Xyrem and divalproex sodium.  In October 2018, due to FDA’s grant of pediatric exclusivity, an additional six months was added to the original expiration dates of all of our Orange Book-listed patents that existed at that time.  As a result, our Orange Book-listed patents have periods of exclusivity between December 2022 (with an additional six months for pediatric exclusivity) and September 2033.  Some of our Xyrem patents have been subject to patent litigation with the companies who filed ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xyrem, including challenge through the IPR procedures of the PTAB.  The PTAB dismissed some of the IPR petitions.  However, in July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld on appeal PTAB decisions finding that six patents associated with the Xywav and Xyrem REMS and three claims of a seventh REMS patent were unpatentable.  As a result, we will not be able to enforce patents or claims that the PTAB found unpatentable.  Although we have settled all patent litigation against the ten companies that filed ANDAs, additional companies may challenge our U.S. patents for Xyrem in the future.  For a description of our Xyrem settlements, see the risk factor under the heading “The introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect sales of our oxybate products” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  For additional information on litigation involving our Orange Book-listed patents, see “
Avadel Litigation
” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
The European Patent Office issued a method of administration patent relating to the DDI between Xyrem and divalproex sodium that expires in 2034.
•
Epidiolex.  
Our patent portfolio relating to the use of CBD in the treatment of epileptic encephalopathies includes 32 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book.  These patents claim the use of CBD for the treatment of convulsive, drop and atonic seizures associated with both LGS and DS, an oral composition of CBD, as well as the use of CBD in combination with clobazam, and the teaching that dose adjustment may be needed when concomitantly prescribed.  The patents currently listed in the Orange Book will expire between 2035 and 2041.  We have filed corresponding patent applications in many jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, U.K., Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.  The USPTO has granted two patents based on data that demonstrates that Epidiolex provides a benefit over synthetic CBD in an animal model of epilepsy, which will expire in 2039 and which are listed in the Orange Book.  Epidiolex has received ODE to treat seizures associated with LGS and DS through 2025 and TSC through 2027.  Some of our Epidiolex patents have been subject to patent litigation with the companies who filed ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Epidiolex.  In November and December 2022, ten companies sent us notices that they had filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of Epidiolex.  For additional information on litigation involving these matters, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

Zepzelca
.  In December 2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with PharmaMar pursuant to which we obtained exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca.  In October 2020, we entered into the amended license agreement which expanded our exclusive license to include rights to develop and commercialize Zepzelca in Canada.  We have a portfolio of in-licensed U.S. and Canadian patents for lurbinectedin relating to compositions, methods of use, and processes.  For example, one Orange Book listed U.S. patent (expiring in 2029, with granted patent term extension) covers a genus of compounds, including lurbinectedin, and use in treating various cancers.  A request for extension (CSP) has also been filed in Canada.  Zepzelca has also been granted ODE for the treatment of adults with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy until 2027 and new chemical entity exclusivity until 2025 in the U.S.  In July and August 2024, we received notices from various ANDA filers that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Zepzelca (lurbinectedin).  In September 2024, we filed patent infringement suits against these ANDA filers.  For a description of this litigation, see “
Zepzelca Patent Litigation
” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  As a result of these lawsuits, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 30 months will be imposed by FDA on these ANDA filers.
•
Rylaze
.  In 2016, we obtained worldwide rights from Pfenex, including Pfenex’s patent rights relating to Rylaze, to develop and commercialize multiple early-stage hematology product candidates, including a license to two U.S. process patents relating to Rylaze, with respective expirations in 2026 and 2038.  Pfenex has been acquired by Ligand.  Rylaze has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with ALL or LBL.  We have two patent application families relating to dosing regimens.  One covers the dosing regimen (25mg/m
2
 intramuscularly every 48 hours), while the other covers various dosing regimens of interest.  If issued, these would expire in 2040 and 2042, respectively.  Another patent application relating to formulations of asparaginase would expire in 2042, if issued.
•
Vyxeos.  
We have a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications for Vyxeos and the CombiPlex technology platform relating to various compositions and methods of making and use.  These include seven U.S. patents covering Vyxeos compositions and methods of use expiring between 2025 and 2032 and two U.S. patents covering CombiPlex (which also cover Vyxeos) expiring in January 2027.  These patents are listed in the Orange Book.  FDA granted Vyxeos ODE for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC, which expired in August 2024.  In March 2021, FDA approved an expanded label for Vyxeos for the treatment of t-AML or AML-MRC in pediatric patients 1 year and older.  In addition, Vyxeos was granted OME by the EC until August 2028, ten years from its EC approval for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC.  Vyxeos was approved by Health Canada for treatment of adults with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC in April 2021.  Vyxeos was approved in March 2024 in Japan and designated as an orphan drug.
•
Defitelio
.  The unique process of deriving defibrotide from porcine DNA is extensive and uses both chemical and biological processes that rely on complex characterization methods.  We have U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to various compositions, methods of use and methods of characterization, with the issued patents expiring at various times between 2021 and 2035.  Three U.S. patents are listed in the Orange Book.  In December 2024, FDA accepted an ANDA for a generic version of Defitelio (defibrotide sodium).  We have yet to receive notice of this ANDA filing.  Defibrotide has also been granted orphan drug designation by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD and by the EC for the prevention of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease.  We acquired the rights to defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in North America, Central America and South America from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2014.
•
Ziihera.  
In 2022, we obtained a license from Zymeworks BC Inc., which included rights to a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications, including compositions and methods of using Ziihera.  The portfolio contains a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Ziihera, which expires in 2034 (excluding any adjustments or extensions).
The patents and/or patent applications that relate to our product candidates include:
•
JZP815
.  Through a collaboration agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Redx in 2019, we acquired a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications, including rights relating to compositions and methods of using JZP815.  The portfolio contains a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to JZP815, which expires in 2035 (excluding any adjustments or extensions).

.  Through the acquisition of Cavion in 2019, we obtained a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications, including rights relating to compositions and methods of using suvecaltamide.  The portfolio includes a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to suvecaltamide, which expires in 2027, but which may be extended to 2032 depending on regulatory approval.  A U.S. patent to the treatment of ET may provide supplemental protection to 2039.
•
JZP441
.  Through a license agreement with Sumitomo in 2022, we obtained a license to a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications, including rights relating to compositions and methods of using JZP441.  The portfolio contains a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to JZP441, which expires in 2040 (excluding any adjustments or extensions).
In addition, we have rights to a number of trademarks and service marks, and pending trademark and service mark applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world to further protect the proprietary position of our products.  For a discussion of the challenges we face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection, see the risk factors under the heading “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Government Regulation 
As a global pharmaceutical company, our activities are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Europe and other countries where we do business.  Regulatory requirements encompass the entire life cycle of pharmaceutical products, from research and development activities to marketing approval, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event and safety reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, pricing and reimbursement, recordkeeping, distribution, importing and exporting.  Regulations differ from country to country and are constantly evolving.
Testing and Approval of Pharmaceutical Products
We are not permitted to market a product in a country until we receive approval from the relevant regulatory authority, such as FDA in the U.S. and the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states.  An application for marketing approval must contain information generated by the applicant, also called a sponsor, demonstrating the quality, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, including data from preclinical and clinical trials, proposed product packaging and labeling and information pertaining to product formulation and the manufacture and analytical testing of the API and the finished product.  
In the U.S., FDA reviews and, if warranted, approves applications for marketing approval.  The process for obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. for a drug or biologic product candidate generally includes:
•
conducting preclinical laboratory and animal testing and submitting the results to FDA in an IND application requesting approval to test the product candidate in human clinical trials; 
•
conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in the desired indication; 
•
submitting an NDA, sNDA, BLA or sBLA as appropriate, to FDA seeking approval for a specific indication; and
•
completing inspections by FDA of the facilities where the product candidate is manufactured, analyzed and stored to demonstrate compliance with cGMP, and any requested FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data supporting the application.
Human clinical trials conducted before approval of a product generally proceed in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap.  In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate in humans, the product candidate is typically tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and tolerability, including side effects associated with increasing doses.  Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.  If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients.  Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with specific protocols, as well as FDA requirements related to conducting the trials and recording and reporting the results, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, to ensure that the resulting data are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.  FDA enforces good clinical practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites.
Once an NDA, sNDA, BLA or sBLA has been compiled and submitted, FDA performs an initial review before it accepts the application for filing.  FDA may refuse to file an application and/or request additional information before acceptance.  Once accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review of the application.  Under the current goals and policies agreed to by FDA under the PDUFA for a new molecular entity, FDA has ten months from the filing decision in which to complete its initial 
29
Table of Contents
review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing decision for a priority application.  FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and in certain circumstances, the PDUFA goal date may be extended. 
FDA also has various programs, including Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and Accelerated Approval (Subpart H and E), RTOR pilot program, that are intended to expedite the process for reviewing certain applications and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints or restricted distribution.  Generally, products may be eligible for one or more of these programs if they are intended for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, have potential to address unmet medical needs, or may provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments.  For example, FDA granted Vyxeos Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations and granted Priority Review with respect to our NDA for Vyxeos for the treatment of t-AML and AML-MRC that was approved in August 2017.  In addition, a PRV may be used to obtain priority review by FDA for one of our future regulatory submissions.  We used the PRV we acquired in May 2018 to obtain priority review for our Xywav sNDA for the treatment of IH, which was approved by FDA in August 2021.  In June 2020, FDA granted Accelerated Approval to Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC.  In December 2020, we initiated the submission of a BLA for Rylaze for ALL under the RTOR pilot program, which was approved by FDA in June 2021.
During its review of an application, FDA evaluates whether the product demonstrates the required level of safety and efficacy for the indication for which approval is sought and conducts the inspections and audits described above.  FDA may also refer an application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a non-binding recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  When FDA completes its evaluation, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter.  A complete response letter generally outlines what FDA considers to be the deficiencies in the application and may indicate that substantial additional testing or information is required prior to FDA approval of the product.  If and when identified deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction after a review of the resubmission of the application FDA will issue an approval letter.  
Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on FDA’s interpretation of the data submitted in the application.  For example, as a condition of approval, FDA may require the sponsor to agree to certain post-marketing requirements, such as conducting Phase 4, or post-approval, clinical trials to gain additional safety data or to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under Accelerated Approval regulations.  FDA’s approval of the NDA for Defitelio included a number of post-marketing commitments and requirements, including the requirement that we conduct a clinical trial to analyze the safety of defibrotide versus best supportive care in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients.  For its approval of Vyxeos, FDA required that we conduct a safety study to characterize infusion-related reactions in patients treated with Vyxeos and a clinical trial to determine dosing to minimize toxicity in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  Further, FDA granted Accelerated Approval to Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC based on data from a Phase 2 trial, which approval is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a post-marketing clinical trial.  
In addition, if FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include a proposed REMS (either as part of the application or after approval), which may include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits; a plan for communication to healthcare providers; or conditions on the product’s prescribing or distribution referred to as elements to assure safe use.  Xywav and Xyrem are required to have a REMS.  For more discussion regarding the Xywav and Xyrem REMS, see the risk factors under the headings “
The distribution and sale of our oxybate products are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a REMS, and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xywav and Xyrem
” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
The EU and many individual countries have regulatory structures similar to the U.S. for conducting preclinical and clinical testing and applying for marketing approval or authorization, although specifics may vary widely from country to country.  Clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation and applicable good clinical practice standards.  In the EU, there are several procedures for requesting marketing authorization which can be more efficient than applying for authorization on a country-by-country basis.  There is a “centralized” procedure allowing submission of a single marketing authorization application to EMA.  If EMA issues a positive opinion, the EC will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).  The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biotechnology-derived medicinal products, and optional for others.  There is also a “decentralized” procedure allowing companies to file identical applications to several EU member states simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state and a “mutual recognition” procedure allowing companies that have a product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states.  The U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU.  Among the changes that have had a direct impact are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is now treated as a third country.  To mitigate the immediate impact of this in December 2020, the EU and U.K. reached an agreement in principle on 
30
Table of Contents
the framework for their future relationship, the EU-U.K. TCA.  With regard to EU regulations, Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU regulatory rules.  As part of the TCA, the EU and the U.K. recognize GMP, inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other party.  The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures.  Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release.  The U.K. has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release; there is a list of approved countries for import into Great Britain, currently including EU and EEA countries, which require no import testing or U.K. “qualified person” release certification.  However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory.  This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the U.K. must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use.  As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain has introduced a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization.  Northern Ireland, however, continues to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the EC.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an application in the EU under the centralized procedure is 210 days, subject to certain exceptions and clock stops.  An initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years, with renewal subject to re-evaluation of the risk-benefit profile of the product.  Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.  
In the EU, if an applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the product under normal conditions of use cannot be provided due to certain specified objective and verifiable reasons, products may be granted marketing authorization “under exceptional circumstances.”  A marketing authorization granted under exceptional circumstances is valid for five years, subject to an annual reassessment of conditions imposed by the EC.  The marketing authorization in the EU for Defitelio was granted under exceptional circumstances because it was not possible to obtain complete information about the product due to the rarity of the disease and because ethical considerations prevented conducting a study directly comparing Defitelio with best supportive care or a placebo.  As a result, the marketing authorization requires us to comply with a number of post-marketing obligations, including obligations relating to the manufacture of the drug substance and finished product, the submission of data concerning patients treated with the product collected through a third-party patient registry and the establishment of a multi-center, multinational and prospective observational patient registry to investigate the long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio during normal use.  We are in the process of conducting the post-authorization study in the EU to provide further data on long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio in normal use.  
Similar to the use of REMS in the U.S. to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks, in the EU and other countries we are required and may, in the future in relation to new products, be required to agree to post-marketing obligations or conditions in the marketing authorization for our products, to include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits, to implement a plan for communication to healthcare providers, and to impose restrictions on the product’s distribution.  For example, the marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. 
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, modifying a REMS, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further regulatory review and approval.  Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use.  Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.
Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations.  We and the third party suppliers of our products are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards as defined by FDA, the EC, EMA, competent authorities of EU member states and other regulatory authorities.  FDA also periodically inspects manufacturing facilities and the sponsor’s and manufacturer’s records related to manufacturing, and assesses compliance with cGMP.  Following such inspections, FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters.  In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements may result in suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, withdrawal of the product from the market, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, among other enforcement remedies both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries.
In the EU, a manufacturing authorization is required to manufacture medicinal products, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance.  These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing products and their APIs, including APIs

manufactured outside of the EU with the intention of importing them into the EU.  In addition to inspection reports, manufacturers and marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in cases of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to manufacturing.
Sales and Marketing of Pharmaceutical Products 
Advertising and Promotional Activities
FDA regulates advertising and promotional activities for products in the U.S., requiring advertising, promotional materials and labeling to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  FDA actively investigates allegations of off-label promotion in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities.  FDA routinely issues informal and more formal communications such as untitled letters or warning letters interpreting its authority over these matters.  While such communications may not be considered final agency decisions, many companies may decide not to contest the agency’s interpretations so as to avoid disputes with FDA, even if they believe the claims they were making to be truthful, not misleading and otherwise lawful. 
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices.  For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s SmPC as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval.  The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product.  Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU.  Other applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and to health care professionals.  Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. 
Fraud and Abuse
We are also subject to numerous fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally.  In the U.S., there are a variety of federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws.  Our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.  The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value to induce (or in return for) the referral of business, including the purchase, recommendation or prescription of a particular drug reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.  The statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution and administrative sanction, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the DOJ and the OIG.  Practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.  For example, in November 2020, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert to highlight certain inherent risks of remuneration related to speaker programs sponsored by drug and device companies, which may not in all circumstances qualify under either safe harbor or statutory exception protection.  The Special Fraud Alert sent a clear signal that speaker programs will be subject to potentially heightened enforcement scrutiny, in particular for those programs with certain characteristics identified as risk factors by OIG, including meals exceeding modest value or where alcohol is made available; lack of substantive or new content presented; programs held at venues not conducive to the exchange of educational information; repeat attendees or attendees without a legitimate business interest; sales or marketing influence on speaker selection; and excessive speaker compensation.  Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without providing specific intent to violate the statute, and may be punishable by civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties, damages, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid.  A claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim.  The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery.  Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties (including mandatory penalties on a per claim or statement basis), treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to other federal false claim and statements laws, some of which extend to non-government health benefit programs.  For example, the healthcare fraud provisions under HIPAA impose criminal liability for, 
32
Table of Contents
among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.  Violations of HIPAA fraud provisions may result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties, fines and damages, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The majority of individual states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Other states restrict whether and when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to health care professionals or engage in other marketing-related activities, and certain states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives.  
Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation
Safety Reporting/Pharmacovigilance
FDA, EMA and other governmental authorities track information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval.  We are required to file periodic safety update reports with the authorities concerning adverse events.  If, upon review, an authority determines that any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing, require post-approval safety studies, require a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market.  For example, if EMA has concerns that the risk-benefit profile of a product has changed, it can, following an investigation procedure, adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be varied or suspended and requiring the marketing authorization holder to conduct post-authorization safety studies.  The opinion is then submitted for approval by the EC.  Also, from time to time, FDA issues drug safety communications on its adverse event reporting system based on its review of reported adverse events. 
FDA and the competent authorities of the EU member states on behalf of EMA also periodically inspect our records related to safety reporting.  Following such inspections, FDA may issue notices on FDA Form 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities.  An FDA Form 483 notice, if issued, can list conditions FDA investigators believe may have violated relevant FDA regulations or guidance.  Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in a warning letter or other regulatory enforcement action.  Similarly, EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee may propose to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the marketing authorization holder be required to take specific steps.  Non-compliance can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
Sunshine Act and Transparency Laws
The Sunshine provisions require tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their families, and reporting to the federal government and public disclosure of these data.  Since 2022, reporting has been required of information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.  A number of states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare providers in the states.  Government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports.  
Outside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct.  The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU member states, as described below in “Business—Government Regulation—Anti-Corruption Legislation” in this Part I, Item 1.  Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.  Certain EU member states, or industry codes of conduct, require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed.  Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states.  Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Controlled Substance Regulations
A drug product approved by FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA depending on the drug’s potential for abuse.  Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA.  The DEA classifies controlled substances into five 
33
Table of Contents
schedules.  Schedule I substances have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S.  Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the U.S. may be classified as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse.  The API of Xywav and Xyrem, oxybate salts, are regulated by the DEA as Schedule I controlled substances, and Xywav and Xyrem drug products are regulated as Schedule III controlled substances.  Certain product candidates we are developing contain controlled substances as defined in the CSA.  Drug products approved by FDA that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts may be controlled substances and will be rescheduled to Schedules II-V after approval or, like Epidiolex, removed completely from the schedules by operation of other laws.
The DEA limits the quantity of certain Schedule I and II controlled substances that may be manufactured and procured in the U.S. in any given calendar year through a quota system and, as a result, quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and procure oxybate salts in the U.S.  Accordingly, we require DEA quotas for Siegfried, our U.S. based sodium oxybate supplier, to manufacture sodium oxybate and for Patheon, our U.S.-based Xyrem supplier, to procure sodium oxybate from Siegfried in order to manufacture and supply us with Xyrem drug product.  We also require DEA quotas for Patheon to manufacture and procure the API of Xywav oxybate salt.  Xywav and Xyrem manufactured at our plant in Ireland enter the U.S. as Schedule III drugs and therefore do not require a DEA manufacturing or procurement quota.
As Schedule III drugs, Xywav and Xyrem are also subject to DEA and state regulations relating to the importation, manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills.  In addition, the third parties who perform our clinical and commercial manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and clinical studies for Xywav and Xyrem are required to maintain necessary DEA registrations and state licenses.  The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. 
Other Regulations
There are many other requirements and restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere imposed on pharmaceutical companies and their activities, including those related to the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes, the export and importation of products, required authorizations for distributors, the identification or licensing of sales representatives, restrictions on the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs, implementation of required compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct, protection of the environment, taxation and work safety.  Non-compliance with such requirements may result in civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act.  The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other countries generally prohibit the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to U.S. or non-U.S. government officials in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure an improper advantage, or obtain or retain business.  The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  The U.K. Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including U.K. and non-U.K. government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person.  In addition, under the U.K. Bribery Act, companies that carry on a business or part of a business in the U.K. may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including U.K. and non-U.K. government officials and private persons in any country, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company.  Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available under the U.K. Bribery Act and certain other laws; under the FCPA, it might be considered as a mitigating factor.  
As described above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with government officials in many countries.  Additionally, in certain countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws.  Recently the SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies.  In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private individuals who report to the SEC original information that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award.

We engage in ongoing efforts designed to ensure our compliance with these laws, including conducting due diligence of our business partners, requiring training of our employees on FCPA requirements, and implementing and maintaining policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws.  However, there is no certainty that all employees and third party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws.  In 
34

particular, we do not control the actions of our suppliers and other third party agents, although we may be liable for their actions.  Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, disgorgement of past profits, and could cause disruption to our business, including through procurement bans or similar administrative actions.  It is possible that an adverse outcome in an FCPA action could materially affect our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position and result in parallel civil litigation such as securities class actions and shareholder derivative suits.
Data Protection and Privacy
We are subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations globally, which restrict the processing of personal data.  The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve with an increased attention in countries globally that could potentially affect our business.  In particular, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes penalties up to 4% of annual global revenue, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act, and numerous other federal, state, national and international laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of the personal data we collect and maintain.  These laws and regulations applicable to our business, increase potential enforcement and litigation activity.  In order to manage these evolving risks, we have adopted a global privacy program that governs the processing of personal data across our business. 
Marketing Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The marketing approval process described above for the U.S. is premised on the applicant being the owner of, or having obtained a right of reference to, all of the data required to prove the safety and effectiveness of a drug product.  This type of marketing application, sometimes referred to as a “full” or “stand-alone” NDA, is governed by Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA.  A Section 505(b)(1) NDA contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, which includes the results of preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in addition to other information.  As an alternative, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides two abbreviated approval pathways for certain drug products.
The first path, under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, usually is used for the approval of a product that is similar, but not identical, to a previously-approved brand-name product, referred to as the RLD.  Under this path, the applicant is permitted to rely to some degree on FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective and must submit its own product-specific data on safety and effectiveness only to the extent necessary to bridge the differences between the products.  The second abbreviated path established under the Hatch-Waxman Act is for the approval of generic drugs.  Section 505(j) of the FDCA permits the submission of an ANDA for a generic version of an approved, brand-name drug.  Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and the RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent.  This data and information are provided instead of data and information independently demonstrating the proposed generic product’s safety and effectiveness.
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant to certify that there are no patents listed for that product in the Orange Book, or that for each Orange Book-listed patent either the listed patent has expired, the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product.  A certification that approval is sought after patent expiration is called a “Paragraph III Certification.”  A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s Orange Book-listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a “Paragraph IV Certification.”  If a relevant patent covers an approved method of use, an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can also file a statement, called, in the case of an ANDA, a “section viii statement,” that the application does not seek approval of the method of use covered by the listed patent.  With such a statement, the applicant must “carve out” the protected method of use (typically an indication and related material) from the proposed product’s labeling.  If the applicant makes a Paragraph III Certification, the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA will not be approved until the listed patents claiming the RLD have expired.  
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to FDA, the applicant must also send a notice of that certification to the NDA holder and the relevant patent holders once FDA accepts the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for filing.  The NDA and patent holders then have 45 days to initiate a patent infringement lawsuit.  Filing the lawsuit triggers an automatic stay on FDA’s approval of the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months after the NDA holder’s receipt of the notice of Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, certain settlements of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.  FDA may issue tentative approval of an application if the application meets all conditions for approval but cannot receive effective approval because the 30-month stay or another period of regulatory exclusivity has not expired.  If an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA is approved before conclusion of any relevant patent litigation, the applicant can choose to launch the product, but does so “at risk” of being liable for damages, and potentially treble damages, if the RLD sponsor or patent holder ultimately prevails in patent litigation.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from statutory periods of non-patent marketing exclusivity that can potentially delay review or approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application.  For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning a drug containing an active moiety that FDA has not previously approved.  During this period, FDA cannot accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for a product containing the same moiety, except that an application containing a Paragraph IV Certification may be submitted after four years, which may trigger the litigation and stay described above.  The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity with the approval of an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for a product containing a previously-approved moiety but that incorporates a change (such as a new indication, dosage form or strength) from an approved product with the same moiety, if the change required clinical data from new investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  This three-year exclusivity does not preclude submission of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA for such a product, but prevents FDA from giving final approval to such product.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years (but not beyond 14 years from the date of approval) for an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, that is approved for a product that contains an active ingredient that has not previously been approved.  The extension, which compensates for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process, is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of an NDA, and all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.  It is available for only one patent for a given product, and it must be a patent that claims the product or a method of using or manufacturing the product.  The USPTO, in consultation with FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.  
In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier qualify for eight years’ data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years’ market exclusivity.  Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced.  However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter.  The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.  In April 2023, the European Commission proposed the “Pharmaceutical Package”, which aims to revise and replace existing pharmaceutical legislation to enhance the availability, accessibility, and affordability of medicinal products across the EU.  This package includes a proposal for a new directive and a new regulation that would replace the current pharmaceutical legislation in the EU.  Among others, the standard data protection period is proposed to decrease from eight to six years but would allow extensions of up to 12 years if specific conditions are met.  As of January 2025, the legislative process is ongoing.  Once an agreement is reached between the Council and the European Parliament, the legislation will be formally adopted and published.  Its adoption is likely to occur in 2026, with implementation following thereafter.
Orphan Drug and Other Exclusivities
Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.  FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product and making it available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from U.S. sales of the product.  Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review process or lower the approval standards, but can provide important benefits, including consultation with FDA.  If a product is approved for its orphan designated use, it may be entitled to ODE, which blocks FDA from approving for seven years any other application for a product that is the same drug for the same indication.  If there is a previously-approved product that is the same drug for the same indication, orphan drug designation requires the sponsor to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the approved product, whereas ODE requires the sponsor to actually demonstrate clinical superiority.  Clinical superiority can be established by way of greater efficacy, greater safety, or making a major contribution to patient care.  Additionally, a later product can be approved if the sponsor holding ODE consents, or cannot adequately supply the market.  ODE does not prevent approval of another sponsor’s application for different indications or uses of the same drug, or for different drugs for the same indication.  Defibrotide was granted ODE by FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023.  Vyxeos was granted ODE by FDA for the treatment of AML until August 2024.  Epidiolex has received ODE to treat seizures associated with LGS and DS through 2025 and TSC through 2027.  In June 2021, FDA, recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav stating that Xywav is clinically superior to Xyrem by means of greater safety due to reduced chronic sodium burden.  Xywav has been granted ODE by FDA to treat narcolepsy through January 2027 and to treat IH through August 2028.  Rylaze has been granted ODE for the treatment of patients with ALL or LBL until 2028.

Biologic products approved under a BLA are subject to the BPCIA, which authorizes an abbreviated approval pathway for a biological product that is “biosimilar” to an already approved biologic, or reference product.  The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from competition by biosimilars.  FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar cannot be licensed until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.  
Under certain circumstances, the exclusivity periods applicable to drugs and biologics and the patent-related protections applicable to drugs may be eligible for a six-month extension if the sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data.  This exclusivity may be granted even if the data does not support a pediatric indication.  We consider seeking pediatric exclusivity for our products whenever appropriate.  For example, in response to a written request from FDA, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Xyrem in children and adolescents aged seven to 17 who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, and submitted study results in a supplement to the Xyrem NDA, seeking approval for this indication.  In October 2018, FDA approved the sNDA and notified us that we had been granted pediatric exclusivity, extending by six months the preclusive effect of our Orange Book-listed patents for Xyrem, as well as the three-year regulatory exclusivity period granted to the Xyrem pediatric indication because of the clinical studies that were necessary for approval of the sNDA.
In the EU, orphan designation may be granted to products that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives.  Orphan designated medicinal products are entitled to a range of benefits during the development and regulatory review process and ten years of OME in all EU member states upon approval.  As in the U.S., a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication may be approved, notwithstanding OME, if the exclusivity holder gives consent or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.  The period of OME granted in relation to the original orphan medicinal product may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated, on the basis of available evidence, that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.  Defibrotide was granted orphan drug designation by the EC for the treatment of VOD and prevention of GvHD until October 2023, by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, and by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD.  Vyxeos has been granted OME by the EC until August 2028.  Epidyolex has been granted OME for use as adjunct therapy of seizures associated with DS and LGS until September 2029, and for  use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with TSC until April 2031.
Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access 
Pricing and Reimbursement 
Successful commercialization of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers.  Third party payors decide which drugs will be reimbursed and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels and conditions for reimbursement.  Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services by examining their cost effectiveness, as demonstrated in pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive products, when available, through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement, co-pay and prior authorization policies.  The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.  Third party payors may require prior approval before covering a specific product, or may require patients and health care providers to try other covered products first.  Third party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.  For certain categories of products, third party payors, principally through contracted PBMs negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers for inclusion of products on their formularies in specific positions or coverage criteria.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have been entering into agreements with certain PBMs or similar organizations to provide rebates for our products where coverage was provided and products were listed in certain formulary positions, among other conditions. 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low‑income and disabled beneficiaries.  Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government covering individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities.  Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products.  Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, as a condition of having federal funds made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program.  Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the CMS, the federal agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price

for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.  If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due.  We are required to provide ASP information for certain of our products to CMS on a quarterly basis.  The ASP is calculated based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS.  This information may be used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. 
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B program, in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B.  The 340B program, which is administered by the HRSA requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered drugs used in an outpatient setting.  These 340B covered entities include certain qualifying community health clinics, a variety of entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, and multiple categories of hospitals, including children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals and hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement.  A regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019.  We also are required to report our 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis and HRSA then publishes them to 340B covered entities.  In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
A provision in The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 eliminated, effective January 2024, the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  The elimination of the cap on rebates means that manufacturer discounts to Medicaid may rise beginning in 2024 and, in certain circumstances, rebates could exceed the amount that state Medicaid programs pay for the drug.  This policy change will have the greatest impact on drugs whose prices have reached the 100 percent Average Manufacturer Price rebate cap.  Further, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 among other things, requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary to negotiate, with respect to Medicare units and subject to a specified cap, the price of a set number of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals per year starting in 2026, penalizes manufacturers of certain Medicare Parts B and D drugs for price increases above inflation, and makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs and a change in manufacturer liability under the program, which could negatively affect our business and financial condition. 
Effective January 2023, a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires a manufacturer of single source drugs or biologicals in single-use packages or single dose containers to pay a refund on discarded amounts of drug under Medicare Part B where the discarded amount exceeds an applicable threshold. 
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also participate in the VA FSS pricing program.  Under this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price to certain federal agencies that is no higher than the statutory FCP.  The FCP is based on the Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis.  We also participate in the Tricare program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries.  The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP.  Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts, which can change and evolve over time.
In addition, in the U.S., drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to companies that have increased the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies.  There are numerous ongoing efforts at the federal and state level seeking to indirectly or directly regulate drug prices to reduce overall healthcare costs using tools such as price ceilings, value-based pricing and increased transparency and disclosure obligations.  Numerous states have passed or are considering legislation that requires or purports to require companies to report pricing information, including proprietary pricing information.  For example, in 2017, California adopted a prescription drug price transparency state bill requiring advance notice of and an explanation for price increases of certain drugs that exceed a specified threshold.  Additionally, some individual states have begun establishing Prescription Drug Affordability Boards to review high-cost drugs and, in some cases, set upper payment limits.  Similar bills have been previously introduced at the federal level and additional legislation could be introduced in the near future.

 Similar to what is occurring in the U.S., political, economic and regulatory developments outside of the U.S. are also subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes and challenges.  Pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels continue to exist.  In various EU member states, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as voluntary and temporary sales rebates, lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative.  HTA of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets.  The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted.  HTA generally compares attributes of individual medicinal products, as compared with other treatment options available on the market.  The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states.  In December 2021, the EC adopted a HTA regulation intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products.  The HTA regulation entered into application in January 2025 and provides that EU member states must use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU.  However, individual EU member states continue to be responsible for drawing conclusions on the overall value of a new health technology for their healthcare system, and pricing and reimbursement decisions. 
In the EU, our products are marketed through various channels and within different legal frameworks.  The making available or placing on the EU market of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited.  However, the competent authorities of the EU member states may exceptionally and temporarily allow and reimburse the supply of such unauthorized products, either on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process, to individual patients or a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product.  Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient or compassionate use programs expire or is terminated or if marketing authorization is granted for the product.  In some EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.  After initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries.  In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states.
For more information, including with respect to recent legal developments regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part B, and the 340B program, see the risk factors under the headings “
Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products and we may be unable to successfully contract for coverage from pharmacy benefit managers and group purchasing organizations, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably; conversely, to secure coverage from these organizations, we may be required to pay rebates or other discounts or other restrictions to reimbursement that could diminish our sales,”
 “
The pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition” 
and 
“If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects”

Patient Copay Assistance and Free Product Programs
We have various patient programs to help patients access and pay for our products, including co-pay coupons for certain products, services that help patients determine their insurance coverage for our products, and a free product program.  We also make grants to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients with their premium, and co-pay and co-insurance obligations.  There has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, as well as reimbursement support offerings.
The OIG has established guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturers who make donations to charitable organizations providing co-pay assistance to Medicare patients.  Such donations are unlikely to run afoul of the anti-kickback laws provided that the organizations receiving donations, among other things, are 
bona fide 
charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product.  In 2016 and 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients.  In April 2019, we finalized our civil settlement agreement with the DOJ and OIG, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement requiring us to maintain our ongoing corporate compliance program and obligating us to

implement or continue, as applicable, a set of defined corporate integrity activities to ensure compliance with OIG’s policies around charitable contributions for a period of five years from the effective date of the corporate integrity agreement.  As of August 2024, we have fulfilled the terms and OIG closed out our corporate integrity agreement.
