Item 5.
Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
Market Information
Our ordinary shares trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “JAZZ.” 
Holders of Ordinary Shares
As of February 19, 2025, there were 882 holders of record of our ordinary shares.  Because almost all of our ordinary shares are held by brokers, nominees and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders.
Dividends
Under Irish law, dividends may only be paid, and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded only out of, “distributable reserves.”  In addition, the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions by us in respect of our ordinary shares, subject to, among other exceptions, (1) a general exception for dividends and other restricted payments not to exceed in the aggregate the greater of $350 million and 3.5% of consolidated total assets (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) when made, (2) an exception that allows for dividends and other restricted payments equal to an amount tied to our financial performance, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement and the total net leverage ratio (as defined in in the Amended Credit Agreement) on a pro forma basis does not exceed 5:1, and (3) an exception that allows for additional dividends and other restricted payments, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement and the total net leverage ratio (as defined in our Amended Credit Agreement) on a pro forma basis is not greater than 4:1.  Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will, subject to Irish legal requirements, be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement or other future borrowing arrangements, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
Irish Law Matters
As we are an Irish incorporated company, the following matters of Irish law are relevant to the holders of our ordinary shares.
Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital
Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies.  Dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.  It is an offense under Irish law (pursuant to various statutory instruments) to transfer funds or make funds or economic resources available, directly or indirectly to any person or entity in contravention of Irish, EU or United Nations sanctions or to otherwise contravene Irish, EU or United Nations sanctions.  Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, securities involving a person or entity that is currently the subject of Irish, EU or United Nations sanctions or any person or entity controlled by any of the foregoing, or any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.  The Financial Transfers Act, 1992 gives power to the Minister for Finance of Ireland to restrict financial transfers between Ireland and other countries and persons.  Financial transfers are broadly defined and include all transfers that would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the member states of the EU.  The acquisition or disposal of interests in shares issued by an Irish incorporated company and associated payments falls within this definition.  In addition, dividends or payments on redemption or purchase of shares and payments on a liquidation of an Irish incorporated company would fall within this definition.  The 1992 Act and underlying EU regulations prohibit financial transfers with certain persons and entities listed in the EU Consolidated Financial Sanctions List and United Nations Security Council Consolidated List, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland. 
Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.
Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders
Irish Tax on Dividends.
  While we have no current plans to pay dividends, dividends on our ordinary shares would generally be subject to Irish Dividend Withholding Tax at the standard rate (currently 25%), unless an exemption applies.

Table of Contents
Irish Tax on Capital Gains
.  A shareholder who (i) is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes and (ii) does not use or hold, and did not acquire, our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholder in Ireland through a branch or agency generally should not be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of our ordinary shares.
A shareholder who is an individual and who is temporarily not resident in Ireland may, under Irish anti-avoidance legislation, still be liable for Irish tax on capital gains on any chargeable gain realized upon the disposal of our ordinary shares during the period in which such individual is a non-resident.
Capital Acquisitions Tax
.  Irish CAT is comprised principally of gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties.  This is because our ordinary shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland as our share register must be held in Ireland.  The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT.
CAT is levied at a rate of 33% above certain tax-free thresholds.  The appropriate tax-free threshold is dependent upon (i) the relationship between the donor and the donee and (ii) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same category of relationship for CAT purposes.  Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT.  Our shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to any tax consequences of holding our ordinary shares, including whether CAT is creditable or deductible in computing any domestic tax liabilities.
Stamp Duty. 
 Irish stamp duty (if any) may become payable in respect of ordinary share transfers.  However, a transfer of our ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired shares through DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.  A transfer of our ordinary shares (i) by a seller who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC to any buyer or (ii) by a seller who holds the ordinary shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired ordinary shares outside of DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares acquired, if greater).  The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the buyer or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or for less than market value, all parties to the transfer.
A shareholder who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC may transfer those ordinary shares into DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer into DTC there is no sale of those book-entry interests to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  Similarly, a shareholder who holds ordinary shares through DTC may transfer those ordinary shares out of DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer, and at the time of the transfer out of DTC there is no sale of those ordinary shares to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  In order for the share registrar to be satisfied as to the application of this Irish stamp duty treatment where relevant, the shareholder must confirm to us that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) (or vice-versa) as a result of the transfer and there is no agreement being contemplated for the sale of the related book-entry interest or the ordinary shares or an interest in the ordinary shares, as the case may be, by the shareholder to a third party.

This table does not include ordinary shares that we withheld in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting and release of restricted stock units.  No ordinary shares were otherwise repurchased during the three-month period ended December 31, 2024. 
2.
On July 31, 2024, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the use of up to $500.0 million to repurchase our ordinary shares under the New Repurchase Program.  Under the New Repurchase Program, which has no expiration date, we may repurchase ordinary shares from time to time by any methods and/or structures permitted by applicable law.  The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of our ordinary shares, alternative investment opportunities, restrictions under our outstanding credit agreement and the indenture for our Secured Notes, corporate and regulatory requirements and market conditions.  The New Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without our prior notice.  The ordinary shares reported in the table above were purchased pursuant to the New Repurchase Program.  The New Repurchase Program replaces and supersedes the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in November 2016, which, as of July 25, 2024, the date it was replaced and superseded by the New Repurchase Program, had authorized the repurchase of ordinary shares having an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.5 billion, exclusive of any brokerage commissions.  On July 25, 2024, the amount remaining authorized for repurchase under the Old Repurchase Program was $47,475, exclusive of any brokerage commissions, which amount is included in the $500.0 million authorized for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program.

Neuroscience
We are the global leader in the development and commercialization of oxybate therapy for patients with sleep disorders.  Xyrem was approved by FDA in 2002, and is indicated for treating cataplexy and EDS in patients seven years of age or older with narcolepsy.  In 2020, we received FDA approval for Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy.  In August 2021, Xywav became the first and only therapy approved by FDA for the treatment of IH in adults.  Xywav is an oxybate therapy that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem.  Xywav has become a standard of care for patients with narcolepsy and IH.
Since there is no cure for narcolepsy and long-term disease management is needed, we believe that Xywav represents an important therapeutic option for patients with this sleep disorder.  Our commercial efforts are focused on educating patients and physicians about the lifelong impact of high sodium intake, and how the use of Xywav enables them to address what is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity.  We view the adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy as a positive indication that physicians and patients appreciate the benefits of a low-sodium oxybate option.
In June 2021, FDA recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav in narcolepsy.  ODE extends through January 2028.  Nevertheless, Lumryz, a fixed-dose, high-sodium oxybate, was approved by FDA on May 1, 2023, for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and was launched in the U.S. market by Avadel.  FDA continues to recognize seven years of ODE for Xywav in narcolepsy.  In connection with granting ODE, FDA stated that "Xywav is clinically superior to Xyrem by means of greater safety because Xywav provides a greatly reduced chronic sodium burden compared to Xyrem.”  FDA's summary also stated that "the differences in the sodium content of the two products at the recommended doses will be clinically meaningful in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in a substantial proportion of patients for whom the drug is indicated."  FDA has also recognized that the difference in sodium content between Xywav and Lumryz is likely to be clinically meaningful in all patients with narcolepsy and that Xywav is safer than Lumryz in all such patients.  Lumryz has the same sodium content as Xyrem.  Xywav is the only approved oxybate therapy that does not carry a warning and precaution related to high sodium intake.

On August 12, 2021, FDA approved Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults.  Xywav remains the first and only FDA-approved therapy to treat IH.  We initiated the U.S. commercial launch of Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults in November 2021.  In January 2022, FDA recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav in IH that extends through August 2028.  IH is a debilitating neurologic sleep disorder characterized by chronic EDS (the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in the irrepressible need to sleep or unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness), severe sleep inertia, and prolonged and non-restorative nighttime sleep.  An estimated 37,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with IH and are actively seeking healthcare.
We have agreements in place for Xywav with all three major PBMs in the U.S.  To date, we have entered into agreements with various entities and have achieved benefit coverage for Xywav in both narcolepsy and IH indications for approximately 90% of commercial lives.
We have seen strong adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy since its launch in November 2020, and increasing adoption in IH since its launch in November 2021.  Exiting 2024, there were approximately 14,150 patients taking Xywav, including approximately 10,250 patients with narcolepsy and approximately 3,900 patients with IH.  
We acquired Epidiolex (Epidyolex outside the U.S.) in May 2021 as part of the GW Acquisition, which expanded our growing neuroscience business with a global, high-growth childhood-onset epilepsy franchise.  Epidiolex was approved in the U.S. in June 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, LGS and DS, in patients two years of age and older, and subsequently approved in July 2020 for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in patients one year of age and older.  FDA also approved the expansion of all existing indications, LGS and DS, to patients one year of age and older.  The rolling European launch of Epidyolex is also underway following EC approval in September 2019 for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with LGS or DS, in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.  The clobazam restriction is limited to the EU and Great Britain.  Epidyolex is now launched in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.  Epidyolex was also approved for adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with TSC for patients 2 years of age and older in the EU in April 2021 and Great Britain in August 2021, and is approved or under review for this indication in other markets.  Outside the U.S. and Europe, Epidiolex/Epidyolex is approved in Israel, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan.
Oncology
Rylaze was approved by FDA in June 2021 under the Real-Time Oncology Review program, and was launched in the U.S. in July 2021 for use as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with ALL or LBL in pediatric and adult patients one month and older who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase.  Rylaze is the only recombinant erwinia asparaginase manufactured product approved in the U.S. that maintains a clinically meaningful level of asparaginase activity throughout the entire course of treatment.  We developed Rylaze to address the needs of patients and health care providers for an innovative, high-quality erwinia asparaginase with reliable supply.  The initial approved recommended dosage of Rylaze was for an IM administration of 25 mg/m2 every 48 hours.  In November 2022, FDA approved an sBLA for a Monday/Wednesday/Friday 25/25/50 mg/m2 IM dosing schedule.  In September 2023, the EC granted marketing authorization for JZP458 under the trade name Enrylaze.  This product has also been approved in Great Britain, Canada and Switzerland.
We acquired U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca in early 2020, and launched six months thereafter, with an indication for treatment of patients with SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.  Our education and promotional efforts are focused on SCLC-treating physicians.  We are continuing to raise awareness of Zepzelca across academic and community cancer centers.  In collaboration with Roche, we have an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of Zepzelca for use as maintenance therapy in first-line extensive-stage SCLC in combination with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) following induction therapy with carboplatin, etoposide and Tecentriq.  In October 2024, we announced positive top-line results from the trial showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for Zepzelca and atezolizumab in combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  We plan to submit an sNDA in the first half of 2025 to support this combination in the first-line maintenance setting.    
We acquired exclusive development and commercialization rights to Ziihera in 2022 through an exclusive licensing agreement with a subsidiary of Zymeworks providing development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab across all indications in the U.S., Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks.  The term of the license agreement extends on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such licensed product in such country.  We have the right to terminate the amended license agreement at will upon a specified notice period, and either party can terminate the amended license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.
Ziihera is a bispecific HER2-directed antibody that binds to two extracellular sites on HER2.  Binding of zanidatamab-hrii with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the tumor cell surface.  In the U.S., Ziihera

was approved by FDA in November 2024 and is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) BTC, as detected by an FDA-approved test.
Defitelio is the first and only approved treatment for patients with VOD, sVOD, or VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets.  Utilization of Defitelio is in part driven by evolving treatment practices in HSCT, and we are continuing to educate healthcare professionals on the clinical profile of Defitelio and its role in treating VOD and/or severe VOD following HSCT.
Vyxeos is a treatment for adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML, or AML-MRC.  In March 2021, FDA approved a revised label to include a new indication to treat newly-diagnosed t-AML, or AML-MRC, in pediatric patients aged one year and older.  We continue to expand into new markets internationally as the product receives approvals and reimbursement in relevant markets.  In the U.S., with ongoing trends towards lower-intensity treatments and away from intensive chemotherapy regimens for AML, we have seen increasing competition from other therapeutic options.
Research and Development Progress 
Our research and development activities encompass all stages of development and currently include clinical testing of new product candidates and activities related to clinical improvements of, or additional indications or new clinical data for, our existing marketed products.  We also have active preclinical programs for novel therapies, including neuroscience and precision medicines in oncology.  We are increasingly leveraging our growing internal research and development function, and we have also entered into collaborations with third parties for the research and development of innovative early-stage product candidates and have supported additional investigator-sponsored trials that are anticipated to generate additional data related to our products.  We also seek out investment opportunities in support of the development of early- and mid-stage technologies in our therapeutic areas and adjacencies.  We have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements with third parties, including biotechnology companies, academic institutions and research-based companies and institutions, related to preclinical and clinical research and development activities in hematology and in precision oncology, as well as in neuroscience. 
Within our oncology R&D program, in October 2022, we announced an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement with Zymeworks providing us the right to acquire development and commercialization rights to Zymeworks' zanidatamab across all indications in the U.S., Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks.  In December 2022, we exercised the option to continue with the exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab.  Under the terms of the agreement, Zymeworks received an upfront payment of $50.0 million, and following the exercise of our option to continue the collaboration, a second, one-time payment of $325.0 million.  Zymeworks is also eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $1.4 billion, for total potential payments of $1.76 billion.  Zymeworks is eligible to receive tiered royalties between 10% and 20% on our net sales.  Zanidatamab is a bispecific HER2-directed antibody that binds to two extracellular sites on HER2.  Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials as a treatment for patients with HER2-expressing cancers.  Following positive data from a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating zanidatamab monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic HER2-amplified BTC, we completed a BLA submission in second-line BTC in March 2024.  In May 2024, FDA granted Priority Review of the BLA; we received FDA approval for this BLA in November 2024.  EMA has validated our MAA for zanidatamab in second-line BTC; we anticipate a response to our MAA in 2025.  In addition, we have an ongoing Phase 3 randomized clinical trial evaluating zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy plus or minus tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for HER2-expressing GEA, an ongoing Phase 2 trial examining zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy in first-line patients with HER2-expressing metastatic GEA and an ongoing Phase 3 trial examining zanidatamab in first-line patients with HER2-positive BTC.  In July 2024, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 EmpowHER-BC-303 to evaluate zanidatamab plus chemotherapy or trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer whose disease has progressed on previous T-DXd treatment.  There are also multiple ongoing clinical trials exploring zanidatamab in breast cancer and other HER2-expressing tumor types.  
Our development plan for Zepzelca continues to progress.  We are collaborating with Roche on a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq for use as maintenance therapy in first-line extensive-stage SCLC.  In October 2024, we announced positive top-line results from the trial showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for Zepzelca and atezolizumab in combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  We plan to submit an sNDA in the first half of 2025 to support this combination in the first-line maintenance setting.  In December 2021, our licensor PharmaMar initiated a confirmatory trial in second-line SCLC.  This ongoing three-arm trial is comparing Zepzelca as either monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan to investigator's choice of irinotecan or topotecan.  Data from either the first-line trial of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq or the PharmaMar trial could serve to confirm clinical benefit of Zepzelca and secure full approval in the U.S.
In addition, we have an ongoing Phase 4 observational study to collect real world safety and outcome data in adult Zepzelca monotherapy patients with SCLC who progress on or after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.  Preliminary findings from this study presented at the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer demonstrated Zepzelca provided clinical

benefit when administered as second-line SCLC therapy.  The safety and tolerability profile observed in this study was consistent with prior findings, with no new safety signals reported. 
In June 2022, we announced FDA had cleared our Investigational New Drug application for JZP815 and, in October 2022, we enrolled the first patient in a Phase 1 trial.  JZP815 is an investigational stage pan-RAF kinase inhibitor that targets specific components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that, when activated by oncogenic mutations, can be a frequent driver of human cancer.
In April 2022, we announced that we had entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Werewolf to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to Werewolf's investigational WTX-613, now referred to as JZP898.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $15.0 million to Werewolf, and Werewolf is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $1.26 billion.  If approved, Werewolf is eligible to receive a tiered, mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of JZP898.  This transaction underscores our commitment to enhancing our pipeline to deliver novel oncology therapies to patients, and also provides us with an opportunity to expand into immuno-oncology.  JZP898 is a differentiated, conditionally-activated IFNα INDUKINE™ molecule.  We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of JZP898 in late 2023.
Our neuroscience R&D efforts include an ongoing Phase 3 trial of Epidyolex for LGS, DS and TSC in Japan.  In August 2024, we announced top-line results from the trial.  The trial did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of a pre-specified percentage change in indication-associated seizure frequency during the treatment period (up to 16 weeks) compared to baseline in Japanese pediatric patients; however, numeric improvements were observed in the primary and several secondary endpoints.  No new safety signals were observed in the trial.  We are continuing to collect data in Japanese patients and plan to engage with regulatory authorities in Japan regarding a potential new drug application. 
In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for suvecaltamide (JZP385), for ET.  Additionally, in November 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of suvecaltamide in patients with Parkinson's disease tremor.  In June 2024, we announced the ET trial did not achieve statistical significance on the primary and key secondary endpoint for the 30 mg dose.  In January 2025, we announced that consistent with the results from the ET trial, results from the Parkinson's disease tremor trial did not show statistical significance on the primary and key secondary endpoint.  Based on these results, we will not continue the ET or PDT development program.  We are exploring options for the suvecaltamide program.  We are also pursuing early-stage activities related to the development of JZP324, an extended-release low sodium, oxybate formulation that we believe could provide a clinically meaningful option for narcolepsy patients.
In May 2022, we announced that we had entered into a licensing agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Europe and other territories for JZP441, also known as DSP-0187, a potent, highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist with potential application for the treatment of narcolepsy, IH and other sleep disorders.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $50.0 million to Sumitomo, and Sumitomo is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $1.09 billion.  If approved, Sumitomo is eligible to receive a tiered, low double-digit royalty on our net sales of JZP441.  In November 2023, we announced that we achieved initial proof-of-concept in our Phase 1 clinical trial program in healthy volunteers as demonstrated by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT).  At that time, we also noted the program was being paused as we analyzed safety findings related to visual disturbances and cardiovascular effects; no liver toxicity signals were observed.  Following additional review of the trial findings and input from FDA, we plan to initiate a small Phase 1b trial of JZP441 in narcolepsy Type 1 patients in 2025.  We expect data from this trial will further our understanding of JZP441 and orexin-2 receptor agonism, providing learnings that could inform future development efforts.

Challenges, Risks and Trends Related to Our Business
Our operating plan assumes that Xywav, with 92% lower sodium compared to high-sodium oxybates (depending on the dose) absence of a sodium warning and dosing titration option, will remain 
the #1 branded oxybate treatment for narcolepsy; the position it held based on revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024
.  In June 2021, FDA recognized seven years of ODE for Xywav in narcolepsy through July 21, 2027 (which was subsequently extended to January 21, 2028), stating that Xywav is clinically superior to Xyrem by means of greater safety due to reduced chronic sodium burden.  While we expect that our business will continue to meaningfully depend on oxybate revenues, there is no guarantee that oxybate revenues will remain at current levels.  
Our ability to successfully commercialize Xywav depends on, among other things, our ability to maintain adequate payor coverage and reimbursement for Xywav and acceptance of Xywav by physicians and patients, including of Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults.  In an effort to support strong adoption of Xywav and patient success, we are focused on facilitating payor coverage for Xywav and providing robust patient copay and savings programs.
Xywav and Xyrem face competition from a branded product for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy.  Avadel’s Lumryz was launched in the U.S. market in June 2023.  On June 22, 2023, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaration that FDA’s approval of the NDA for Avadel's Lumryz was unlawful.  In the complaint, we alleged that FDA acted outside its authority under the Orphan Drug Act, when, despite ODE protecting Xywav, FDA approved the Lumryz NDA and granted Lumryz ODE based on FDA’s finding that Lumryz makes a major contribution to patient care and is therefore clinically superior to Xywav and Xyrem.  On September 15, 2023, we filed a motion for summary judgment.  On October 20, 2023, Avadel and FDA filed cross motions for summary judgment.  Oral argument on these motions was held on May 10, 2024, and on October 30, 2024, the District Court issued an order denying our motion for summary judgment and granting Avadel’s and FDA’s cross-motions for summary judgment.  We have appealed the matter to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  We cannot at this time predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this litigation or the impact of this litigation on our business.

In addition, in January 2023, our oxybate products began to face competition from an AG version of high-sodium oxybate pursuant to a settlement agreement we entered into with an ANDA filer.  In July 2023, a volume-limited ANDA filer launched an AG version of high-sodium oxybate.  These AG products have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to negatively impact Xyrem and Xywav sales for patients with narcolepsy.  Specifically, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma launched its AG version of sodium oxybate in January 2023 and Amneal launched its AG version of sodium oxybate in July 2023.  Hikma has elected to continue to sell the Hikma AG product, with royalties to be paid to us, for a total of up to four years beginning in January 2024, which election may be terminated by Hikma in accordance with the notice provisions in the agreements between the parties.  We have the right to receive a meaningful royalty from Hikma on net sales of the Hikma AG product; the royalty rate was fixed for the second half of 2023.  There was a substantial increase in the royalty rate beginning in January 2024, which will remain fixed for the duration of the agreement's term.  We are also paid for supply of the Hikma AG product and reimbursed by Hikma for a portion of the services costs associated with the operation of the Xywav and Xyrem REMS, and distribution of the Hikma AG product.  We also granted Hikma a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product but, if it elects to launch its own generic product, Hikma will no longer have the right to sell the Hikma AG product.  In addition, Hikma would need to set up its own REMS (or join an existing REMS operated by another company), which must be open to any other company seeking to commercialize a sodium oxybate product.  In our settlements with Amneal, Lupin, and Par, we granted each party the right to sell a limited volume of an AG product in the U.S. beginning on July 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025, with royalties to be paid to us.  Amneal launched its AG version of high-sodium oxybate in July 2023.  At this time, Amneal has rights to sell a low-single-digit percentage of historical Xyrem sales over each 6-month sales period.  At this time, Lupin and Par have elected not to launch an AG product.  AG products will be distributed through the same REMS as Xywav and Xyrem.  We also granted each of Amneal, Lupin and Par a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including the circumstance where Hikma elects to launch its own generic product.  If Amneal, Lupin or Par elects to launch its own generic product under such circumstance, it will no longer have the right to sell an AG product.  In addition, any company commercializing a generic version of high-sodium oxybate would need to establish its own REMS, or join an existing REMS operated by another company. 
 In the future, we expect our oxybate products to continue to face competition from generic versions of high-sodium oxybate pursuant to settlement agreements we entered into with multiple ANDA filers.  In addition, we received notices in June 2021 and February 2023, that Lupin and Teva, respectively, filed ANDAs for generic versions of Xywav.  On October 13, 2023, Lupin announced that it has received tentative approval for its application to market a generic version of Xywav.  Generic competition can decrease the net prices at which branded products, such as Xywav and Xyrem are sold, as can competition from other branded products.  In addition, we have increasingly experienced pressure from third party payors to agree to discounts, rebates or restrictive pricing terms, and we cannot guarantee we will be able to agree to commercially reasonable terms with PBMs, or similar organizations and other third party payors, or that we will be able to ensure patient access and acceptance on formularies.  Entering into agreements with PBMs or similar organizations and payors to ensure patient access has and may continue to result in decreased net prices for some of our products.  Moreover, generic or AG high-sodium oxybate products or branded high-sodium oxybate entrants in narcolepsy, such as Avadel’s Lumryz, have had and may continue to have the effect of changing payor or formulary coverage of Xywav or Xyrem in favor of other products, and indirectly adversely affect sales of Xywav and Xyrem.
In any event, we expect that the approval and launch of AG products or other generic versions of Xyrem or Xywav and the approval and launch of any other sodium oxybate product, such as Avadel’s Lumryz, or alternative product that treats narcolepsy will continue to have a negative impact on, and could have a material adverse effect on, our sales of Xywav and Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects are also dependent on our ability to maintain or increase sales of Epidiolex/Epidyolex in the U.S. and Europe, which is subject to many risks and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to successfully commercialize Epidiolex/Epidyolex for its approved indications.  The commercial success of Epidiolex/Epidyolex depends on the extent to which patients and physicians accept and adopt Epidiolex/Epidyolex as a treatment for seizures associated with LGS, DS and TSC, and we do not know whether our or others’ estimates in this regard will be accurate.  Physicians may not prescribe Epidiolex and patients may be unwilling to use Epidiolex/Epidyolex if coverage is not provided or reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost.  Additionally, any negative development for Epidiolex/Epidyolex in the market, in clinical development for additional indications, or in regulatory processes in other jurisdictions, may adversely impact the commercial results and potential of Epidiolex/Epidyolex.  Moreover, we expect that Epidiolex will face competition from generic products in the future.  For example, in November and December 2022, we received notices from ten ANDA filers that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Epidiolex.  In addition, there are non-FDA approved cannabidiol preparations being made available from companies through the state-enabled medical marijuana industry, which might attempt to compete with Epidiolex.  Thus, significant uncertainty remains regarding the commercial potential of Epidiolex/Epidyolex.

In addition to our neuroscience products and product candidates, we are commercializing a portfolio of oncology products, including Rylaze, Zepzelca, Ziihera, Defitelio and Vyxeos.  An inability to effectively commercialize Rylaze, Zepzelca, Ziihera, Defitelio and Vyxeos and to maximize their potential where possible through successful research and development activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
A key aspect of our growth strategy is our continued investment in our evolving and expanding R&D activities.  If we are not successful in the clinical development of our product candidates, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, or if sales of an approved product do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from our product candidates would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.  
In addition to continued investment in our R&D pipeline, we intend to continue to grow our business by acquiring or in-licensing, and developing, including with collaboration partners, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential.  Failure to identify and acquire, in-license or develop additional products or product candidates, successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products or product candidates into our portfolio or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing, such as the GW Acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to healthcare cost containment and drug pricing scrutiny by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and internationally.  If new healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for our products may be affected, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.  For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 among other things, requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary to negotiate, with respect to Medicare units and subject to a specified cap, the price of a set number of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals per year starting in 2026, penalizes manufacturers of certain Medicare Parts B and D drugs for price increases above inflation, and makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs and a change in manufacturer liability under the program, that could negatively affect our business and financial condition.  In addition, under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, rebates owed by manufacturers are no longer subject to a cap on the rebate amount, which could adversely affect our rebate liability.  We are also subject to increasing pricing pressure and restrictions on reimbursement imposed by payors.  If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate formulary positions and institutional access for our current products and future approved products, we will not be able to achieve a return on our investment and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially adversely affected. 
While certain preparations of cannabis remain Schedule I controlled substances, if such products are approved by FDA for medical use in the U.S. they are rescheduled to Schedules II-V, since approval by FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement; or such products may be removed from control under the Controlled Substances Act entirely.  If any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will make a scheduling determination.  U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies may request additional information regarding the abuse potential of our products which may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost, delay the approval and/or delay the launch of that product.
Finally, business practices by pharmaceutical companies, including product formulation improvements, patent litigation settlements, and REMS programs, have increasingly drawn public scrutiny from legislators and regulatory agencies, with allegations that such programs are used as a means of improperly blocking or delaying competition.  Government investigations with respect to our business practices, including as they relate to the Xywav and Xyrem REMS, the launch of Xywav, our Xyrem patent litigation settlement agreements or otherwise, could cause us to incur significant monetary charges to resolve these matters and could distract us from the operation of our business and execution of our strategy.  In addition, from June 2020 to May 2022, a number of lawsuits were filed on behalf of purported direct and indirect Xyrem purchasers, alleging that the patent litigation settlement agreements we entered with certain generic companies violate state and federal antitrust and consumer protection laws.  For additional information on these lawsuits and other legal matters, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  It is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed against us making similar or related allegations.  We cannot predict the outcome of these or potential additional lawsuits; however, if the plaintiffs were to be successful in their claims against us, they may be entitled to injunctive relief or we may be required to pay significant monetary damages.  Moreover, we are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of various claims, legal proceedings, and government investigations apart from those set forth above that have arisen in the ordinary course of business that have not yet been fully resolved and that could

adversely affect our business and the execution of our strategy.  Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

Product Sales, Net
 Xywav product sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes of 16% and, to a lesser extent, a higher selling price, offset by higher gross to net deductions.  We continue to see Xywav adoption in patients 
87
Table of Contents
with narcolepsy driven by educational initiatives around efficacy and the benefit of lowering sodium intake.  In addition, Xywav product sales were positively impacted by adoption in IH; Xywav is the only oxybate therapy approved to treat IH and we see continued growth of new prescribers.  Exiting 2024, there were 10,250 patients taking Xywav for narcolepsy and 3,900 taking Xywav for IH, an increase of approximately 8% and 41%, respectively, compared to 2023.  Xywav product sales increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased sales volumes of 28% and, to a lesser extent, a higher selling price.  Xyrem product sales decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to decreased sales volumes of 57%, due to high-sodium oxybate competition and the adoption of Xywav by existing Xyrem patients and higher gross to net deductions, partially offset by a higher selling price.  Xyrem product sales decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to decreased sales volumes of 49%, reflecting the adoption of Xywav by existing Xyrem patients and the impact of high-sodium oxybate competition, offset by a higher selling price and lower gross to net deductions.  Epidiolex/Epidyolex product sales increased by 15% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes of 12% due to increased demand, and, to a lesser extent, geographic expansion and a higher average selling price.  Epidiolex/Epidyolex product sales increased by 15% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased sales volumes of 15% due to increased demand and expansion in European markets and, to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price, partially offset by higher gross to net deductions.
 Rylaze/Enrylaze product sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a higher average selling price, partially offset by higher gross to net deductions.  Rylaze sales volumes in 2024 have been negatively impacted due to an update to the COG pediatric treatment protocols for ALL, which impacts the timing of asparaginase administration.  While this had a temporary negative impact on Rylaze product sales in the latter part of 2024, we do not expect it will affect ongoing demand and we still expect our product sales to normalize by early 2025.  Rylaze remains the only therapy available to patients in the U.S. who have a hypersensitivity reaction to E. coli-derived asparaginase.  Rylaze product sales increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased sales volumes of 37% and, to a lesser extent, a higher selling price, offset by higher gross to net deductions.  The increased sales volumes reflected the significant unmet patient need for a high-quality, reliable supply of Erwinia asparaginase for patients with ALL.  Zepzelca product sales increased by 11% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes and a higher selling price, offset by higher gross to net deductions.  Zepzelca product sales increased by 7% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a higher selling price and increased sales volumes, offset by higher gross to net deductions.  Defitelio/defibrotide product sales increased by 18% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes, and to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price.  Defitelio/defibrotide product sales decreased by 5% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a higher selling price.  Vyxeos product sales increased by 10% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by a lower average selling price due to regional mix.  Vyxeos product sales increased by 15% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased sales volumes and to a lesser extent, a higher selling price, partially offset by higher gross to net deductions.
We expect product sales, net will increase in 2025 over 2024, primarily driven by growth across our commercial portfolio, offset by a decrease in sales of Xyrem due to the impact of high-sodium oxybate competition.
Royalties and Contract Revenues
Royalties and contract revenues increased in 2024 compared to 2023 and in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to royalty revenue received from Hikma on net sales of their high-sodium oxybate AG.  We expect royalties and contract revenues to increase in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to increased royalty revenues arising from net sales of high-sodium oxybate AG.
Cost of Product Sales
Cost of product sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, due to increased inventory provisions and changes in product mix, offset by a decrease in the fair value step-up expense, of $16.4 million.  Cost of product sales decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a reduction in the fair value step-up expense of $121.9 million and the impact of an expense for past royalties recorded in 2022 in connection with a settlement agreement with Otsuka, partially offset by changes in product mix.  Gross margin as a percentage of net product sales was 88.3% in both 2024 and 2023 and 85.2% in 2022.  The increase in our gross margin percentage in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value step-up expense in 2023 and the impact of the Otsuka royalty expense in 2022.  
We expect our cost of product sales to increase in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily driven by changes in product mix.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses of $72.6 million, primarily driven by higher headcount and increased investment in sales and marketing of $19.3 million, in support of our commercial portfolio and increased litigation costs of $13.6 million, partially offset by costs relating to the impairment of facility assets of $61.7 million and program terminations of $23.5 million incurred in 2023.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the loss on

disposal of Sunosi of $40.8 million, restructuring costs of $22.1 million and GW related integration costs of $21.1 million incurred in 2022, together with a reduction in costs related to program terminations of $19.1 million and in compensation related expenses, partially offset by an impairment of facility assets of $61.7 million in 2023.  We expect selling, general and administrative expenses in 2025 to increase compared to 2024, primarily due to investment in our commercial portfolio, including the launch of Ziihera, along with increased compensation-related expenses.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to clinical studies and outside services, personnel expenses, milestone expenses and other research and development costs.  Clinical study and outside services costs relate primarily to services performed by clinical research organizations, materials and supplies, and other third party fees.  Personnel expenses relate primarily to salaries, benefits and share-based compensation.  Other research and development expenses primarily include overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs.  We do not track fully-burdened research and development expenses on a project-by-project basis.  We manage our research and development expenses by identifying the research and development activities that we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on our assessment of which development activities are important to our business and have a reasonable probability of success, and by dynamically allocating resources accordingly.  We also continually review our development pipeline projects and the status of their development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our development pipeline projects that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.  
The following table provides a breakout of our research and development expenses by major categories of expense (in thousands):

Research and development expenses increased by $34.3 million in 2024 compared to 2023.  Clinical studies and outside services costs increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the addition of costs related to clinical programs for zanidatamab, partially offset by a reduction in costs related to JZP150 (post-traumatic stress disorder) and JZP385.  Personnel expenses increased by $32.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased compensation related expenses in support of our development programs.  Research and development expenses increased by $259.2 million in 2023 compared to 2022.  Clinical studies and outside services costs increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the addition of costs related to clinical programs for zanidatamab, and, to a lesser extent, JZP385 and JZP441, partially offset by a reduction in costs related to JZP458 (Rylaze).  Personnel expenses increased by $34.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased headcount in support of our development programs.  Milestone expenses of $5.5 million in 2023 primarily related to a milestone expense of $5.0 million under our collaboration and license agreement with Werewolf.  Milestone expenses of $6.3 million in 2022 primarily related to a milestone expense of $5.0 million made under our asset purchase and collaboration agreements with Redx.  We incurred restructuring costs of $10.3 million in 2022.
For 2025, we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease compared to 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in clinical studies and outside services costs relating to JZP385 and continued portfolio prioritization.
Intangible Asset Amortization
Intangible asset amortization increased by $19.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the foreign exchange impact on our sterling-denominated intangible assets.  Intangible asset amortization for 2023 was in line with 2022.  Intangible asset amortization in 2025 is expected to be broadly in line with 2024. 
Acquired In-Process Research and Development 
Acquired IPR&D expense in 2024 related to the upfront payment made in connection with our asset purchase agreement with Redx, of $10.0 million.  Acquired IPR&D expense in 2023 primarily related to the upfront payment made in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement with Autifony of $18.0 million.  Acquired IPR&D expense in 2022 primarily related to the upfront payments made in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreements with Zymeworks and Werewolf of $375.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and our licensing agreement with Sumitomo of $50.0 million.

Table of Contents
Intangible Asset Impairment Charge
In 2022, we recorded an acquired IPR&D asset impairment charge of $133.6 million as a result of the decision to discontinue our nabiximols program.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net decreased by $51.3 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher interest income on investments driven by our increased deposits and higher interest rates and lower interest expense on the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans following the 2024 repricings described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreement” below, offset by the inclusion of interest expense on our 2030 Notes.  Interest expense, net increased by $1.2 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher interest rates on our outstanding term loan borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income on investments and the inclusion of interest expense on the now repaid Euro Term Loan, in 2022.  
We expect interest expense, net to decrease in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to lower interest expense following the voluntary repayment of $750.0 million on our Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans in January 2025, partially offset by lower interest income and interest expense on the 2030 Notes.  For further information on this please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Foreign Exchange (Gain) Loss 
The foreign exchange (gain) loss is primarily related to the translation of sterling and euro-denominated net monetary liabilities, primarily intercompany balances, held by subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency and related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments.
Income Tax Benefit
Our income tax benefit was $91.4 million, $119.9 million and $158.6 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to tax arising on income or losses in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, offset by deductions on subsidiary equity, patent box benefits, foreign derived intangible income benefits and originating tax credits.  Our income tax benefit in 2024 decreased compared to 2023 primarily due to the change in income mix across jurisdictions, partially offset by patent box benefits.  Our income tax benefit in 2023 decreased compared to 2022 primarily due to pretax losses from payments for acquired IPR&D made in 2022 and the impact of the 2022 impairment of our acquired IPR&D asset as a result of the decision to discontinue our nabiximols program, partially offset by the change in income mix across jurisdictions. 
Equity in Loss of Investees
Equity in loss of investees relates to our share in the net loss of companies in which we have made investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.0 billion, borrowing available under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $885.0 million and a long-term debt principal balance of $6.2 billion.  Our long-term debt included $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes, $1.0 billion principal amount of the 2026 Notes and $1.0 billion principal amount of the 2030 Notes.  During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations which we expect will enable us to operate our business and de-lever our balance sheet over time.
Since the closing of the acquisition of GW in May 2021, we have fully repaid our Euro Term Loan.  With respect to our Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, we have made voluntary repayments of 
$1.1 billion, $300.0 million in September 2022 and $750.0 million in January 2025, along with mandatory repayments of $108.5 million.  
In August 2024, we repaid the $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes.
We have a significant amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis.  For a more detailed description of our debt arrangements, including information relating to our scheduled maturities with respect to our long-term debt see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K
.  This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to the factors set forth in in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” o
f this Annual Report on Form 10‑K under the headi
ng “We have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position, and our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.”
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments balances, cash we expect to generate from operations and funds available under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and to meet our 
90
Table of Contents
existing obligations for the foreseeable future.  The adequacy of our cash resources depends on many assumptions, including primarily our assumptions with respect to product sales and expenses, as well as the other factors set forth in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K under the headings “Risks Related to our Lead Products and Product Candidates” and 
“To continue to grow our business, we will need to commit substantial resources, which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate and grow our business.”  
Our assumptions may prove to be wrong or other factors may adversely affect our business, and as a result we could exhaust or significantly decrease our available cash resources, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations which could, among other things, force us to raise additional funds and/or force us to reduce our expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
To continue to grow our business over the longer term, we plan to commit substantial resources to product acquisition and in-licensing, product development, clinical trials of product candidates and expansion of our commercial, development, manufacturing and other operations.  In this regard, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate a wide array of strategic transactions as part of our strategy to acquire or in-license and develop additional products and product candidates.  Acquisition opportunities that we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur additional indebtedness, seek equity capital or both.  We regularly evaluate the performance of our products and product candidates to ensure fit within our portfolio and support efficient allocation of capital.  In addition, we may pursue new operations or continue the expansion of our existing operations.  Accordingly, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies to expand our operations or for general corporate purposes.  Raising additional capital could be accomplished through one or more public or private debt or equity financings, collaborations or partnering arrangements.  However, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide resulting from the effects of inflationary pressures, potential future bank failures, or otherwise.  Accordingly, we could experience an inability to access additional capital or our liquidity could otherwise be impacted, which could in the future negatively affect our capacity for certain corporate development transactions or our ability to make other important, opportunistic investments.  In addition, under Irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any ordinary shares, including ordinary shares that are part of our authorized but unissued share capital, and we currently have such authorization.  Moreover, as a matter of Irish law, when an Irish public limited company issues ordinary shares to new shareholders for cash, the company must first offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis, unless this statutory pre-emption obligation is dis-applied, or opted-out of, by approval of its shareholders.  At our annual general meeting of shareholders in July 2024, our shareholders voted to approve our proposal to dis-apply the statutory pre-emption obligation.  This current pre-emption opt-out authority is due to expire in January 2026.  If we are unable to obtain further pre-emption authorities from our shareholders in the future, or otherwise continue to be limited by the terms of new pre-emption authorities approved by our shareholders in the future, our ability to use our unissued share capital to fund in-licensing, acquisition or other business opportunities, or to otherwise raise capital, including at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2026 Notes, the 2030 Notes and/or the Secured Notes, are required to repay outstanding amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement, or pay cash upon exchange of the 2026 Notes or the 2030 Notes, could likewise be adversely affected.  In any event, an inability to borrow or raise additional capital in a timely manner and on attractive terms could prevent us from expanding our business or taking advantage of acquisition opportunities and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.  In addition, if we use a substantial amount of our funds to acquire or in-license products or product candidates, we may not have sufficient additional funds to conduct all of our operations in the manner we would otherwise choose.  Furthermore, any equity financing would be dilutive to our shareholders, and could require the consent of the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement that provides for (i) the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, and the indenture for the Secured Notes for certain financings.

In July 2024, our board of directors authorized the New Repurchase Program.  Under the New Repurchase Program, which has no expiration date, we may repurchase ordinary shares from time to time by any methods and/or structures permitted by applicable law.  The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of our ordinary shares, alternative investment opportunities, restrictions under the Amended Credit Agreement and the indenture for our Secured Notes, corporate and regulatory requirements and market conditions.  The New Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without our prior notice.  The New Repurchase Program replaces and supersedes the Old Repurchase Program.  In 2024, we spent a total of $311.4 million to purchase 2.8 million of our ordinary shares under the repurchase programs at an average total purchase price, including commissions, of $110.06 per share.  The repurchases in 2024 included a total of $150.0 million to repurchase 1.4 million of our ordinary shares, all under the New Repurchase Program, at a purchase price, including commissions, of $109.32 per share and $161.4 million to repurchase 1.5 million of our ordinary shares, all under the Old Repurchase Program, at a purchase price, including commissions, of $110.75 per share.  The repurchases made under the New Repurchase Program in 2024 were effected in privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the 2030 Notes concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the 2030 Notes.  In 2023, we spent a total of $269.8 million to purchase 2.1 million of our ordinary shares under the Old Repurchase Program at an average total purchase price, including commissions, of $126.65 per share.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  As of December 31, 2024, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases under the New Repurchase Program was $350.0 million, exclusive of any brokerage commissions.

Credit Agreement
On May 5, 2021, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, Jazz Lux, and certain of our other subsidiaries, as borrowers, or, collectively with Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and Jazz Lux, the “Borrowers”, entered into the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) the Dollar Term Loan, which was drawn by Jazz Lux on the closing date thereof in U.S. dollars (ii) the Euro Term Loan, which was drawn by Jazz Lux on the closing date thereof in Euros and (iii) the Initial Revolving Credit Facility.
In January 2024, Jazz Lux entered into the Repricing Amendment No.1, to the Credit Agreement.  Upon entry into the Repricing Amendment No.1, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan into the Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans, and Jazz Lux borrowed $201.9 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan that was not converted.  
In July 2024, Jazz Lux entered into the Repricing Amendment No. 2, to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No. 1.  Upon entry into the Repricing Amendment No. 2, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans into the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, and Jazz Lux borrowed $289.6 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans that were not converted.
The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans are a separate class of term loans under the Credit Agreement, as amended by Repricing Amendment No. 1 and Repricing Amendment No. 2, with the same material terms (including with respect to maturity, prepayment, security, covenants and events of default) as the previously outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans and the initial Dollar Term Loan incurred on May 5, 2021, with the interest rate amended as described below and the credit spread adjustment removed.  The principal amount of Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans outstanding immediately prior to the Repricing Amendment No. 2 and the outstanding principal amount of Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans immediately following the Repricing Amendment No.2, each totaled $2.7 billion.  
The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) Term SOFR, or (b) the prime lending rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans is 2.25% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 1.25% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate), a decrease, in each case, of 75 basis points from the applicable margin on the Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans.  The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans are subject to a Term SOFR floor of 0.50%.  As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate and effective interest rate on the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans were 6.61% and 8.27%, respectively.
In November 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No. 1 and Repricing Amendment No. 2, to increase the Initial Revolving Credit Facility from $500.0 million to $885.0 million and extend the maturity date from May 5, 2026 to the Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, provided that:
•
if, as of any date from March 16, 2026 to the 2026 Notes Springing Maturity Date, (x) any 2026 Maturity Indebtedness remains outstanding and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and its subsidiaries is less than an amount equal to 125% of the aggregate principal amount of 2026 Maturity Indebtedness outstanding, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to the 2026 Notes Springing Maturity Date;
•
if, as of February 4, 2028, (x) more than $500,000,000 of the Term Loan Indebtedness remains outstanding and (y) the maturity date of such Term Loan Indebtedness is not later than the date that is 91 days after the Amended 
93
Table of Contents
Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to February 4, 2028; and
•
if, as of the Senior Notes Springing Maturity Date, (x) more than $500,000,000 of the Senior Note Indebtedness remains outstanding and (y) the maturity date with respect to such Senior Note Indebtedness is not later than the date that is 91 days after the Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to October 16, 2028.
Initially, the applicable margin for the loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be 2.00% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 1.00% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate).  Thereafter, the applicable margin for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.75% to 2.75% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 0.75% to 1.75% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate), depending on our first lien secured net leverage ratio level, and any loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are subject to a Term SOFR floor of 0.00%.  The Amended Revolving Credit Facility has a commitment fee payable on the undrawn amount ranging from 0.25% to 0.45% per annum based upon our first lien secured net leverage ratio.  As of December 31, 2024, we had an undrawn Amended Revolving Credit Facility totaling $885.0 million.
2029 Senior Secured Notes
On April 29, 2021, Jazz Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, closed the offering of the Secured Notes in a private placement.  We used the proceeds from the Secured Notes to fund, in part, the cash consideration payable in connection with the GW Acquisition. 
Interest on the Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2022, at a rate of 4.375% per year.  The Secured Notes mature on January 15, 2029.
The Secured Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by us and each of our restricted subsidiaries, other than Jazz Securities, that is a borrower, or a guarantor, under the Amended Credit Agreement.  The Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured by a first priority lien (subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions), equally and ratably with the Amended Credit Agreement, on the collateral securing the Amended Credit Agreement.
Some or all of the Secured Notes, may be redeemed at any time and from time to time at a specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, to the redemption date.  In addition, Jazz Securities may redeem all but not part of the Secured Notes at its option at any time in connection with certain tax-related events at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Secured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If we undergo a change of control, Jazz Securities will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to certain exceptions. 
The indenture governing the Secured Notes contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of junior indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.  If Jazz Securities or our restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, Jazz Securities will be required under certain circumstances to make an offer to purchase the Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  
As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate and effective interest rate on the Secured Notes were 4.375% and 4.64%, respectively.
Exchangeable Senior Notes
2030 Notes. 
 In September 2024, Jazz Investments, our wholly owned subsidiary, completed a private placement of $1.0 billion principal amount of the 2030 Notes.  
Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2025, at a rate of 3.125% per year.  In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay additional amounts as a result of any applicable tax withholding or deductions required in respect of payments on the 2030 Notes.  The 2030 Notes mature on September 15, 2030, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased.
The holders of the 2030 Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2030 Notes for cash at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date in the event we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes), such as specified change of control transactions, our liquidation or 
94
Table of Contents
dissolution or the delisting of our ordinary shares from any of The New York Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market (or any of their respective successors).  
Additionally, the terms and covenants in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes include certain events of default after which the 2030 Notes may be due and payable immediately.  
Prior to September 15, 2030, we may redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole but not in part, in connection with certain tax-related events.  We also may redeem the 2030 Notes on or after September 20, 2027 and prior to June 15, 2030, in whole or in part (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes), if the last reported sale price per ordinary share has been at least 130% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The 2030 Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 6.5339 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $153.05 per ordinary share.  Upon exchange of the 2030 Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, ordinary shares or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes being exchanged.  The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain make-whole fundamental changes (as defined in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes) that occur prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its 2030 Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change or exchange its 2030 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period.  Prior to June 15, 2030, the 2030 Notes will be exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
2026 Notes
.  In June 2020, Jazz Investments completed a private placement of $1.0 billion principal amount of the 2026 Notes.  We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase for cash $332.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2021, through privately-negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the 2026 Notes.  Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2020, at a rate of 2.00% per year.  In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay additional amounts as a result of any applicable tax withholding or deductions required in respect of payments on the 2026 Notes.  The 2026 Notes mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed.
The holders of the 2026 Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes for cash in the event we undergo certain fundamental changes, such as specified change of control transactions, our liquidation or dissolution or the delisting of our ordinary shares from any of The New York Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market (or any of their respective successors).  Additionally, the terms and covenants in the indenture related to the 2026 Notes include certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be due and payable immediately.  Prior to June 15, 2026, we may redeem the 2026 Notes, in whole but not in part, subject to compliance with certain conditions, if we have, or on the next interest payment date would, become obligated to pay to the holder of any 2026 Notes additional amounts as a result of certain tax-related events.  We also may redeem the 2026 Notes prior to March 15, 2026, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price per ordinary share has been at least 130% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide the notice of redemption.
The 2026 Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 6.4182 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $155.81 per ordinary share.  On July 22, 2024, we irrevocably elected to fix the settlement method for exchange of the 2026 Notes to a combination of cash and ordinary shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc with a specified cash amount per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged equal to or in excess of $1,000.  As a result, for any 2026 Notes exchanged subsequent to such notice, an exchanging holder will receive (i) up to $1,000 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged and (ii) cash, ordinary shares, or any combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged.  The exchange rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain make-whole fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, we will in certain circumstances increase the exchange rate for holders of the 2026 Notes who elect to exchange their 2026 Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period.  Prior to March 15, 2026, the 2026 Notes will be exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

2024 Notes.
  In 2017, Jazz Investments completed a private placement of $575.0 million principal amount of 2024 Notes.  We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $500.0 million in outstanding loans under the Initial Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses.  We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Interest on the 2024 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2018, at a rate of 1.50% per year.  The 2024 Notes were exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 4.5659 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes, which was equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $219.02 per ordinary share.  
On August 15, 2024, the maturity date for the 2024 Notes, we repaid the $575.0 million aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Contractual Obligations
Our primary contractual obligations relate to our outstanding indebtedness, as described above.  We also have obligations under lease agreements and third-party manufacturing agreements.  For information relating to our scheduled maturities with respect to our long-term debt and our lease liabilities see Note 11 Debt and Note 12 Leases, respectively, and for information relating to our noncancelable purchase commitments due within one year see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  Our long-term noncancelable purchase commitments were $31.7 million at December 31, 2024, primarily related to agreements with third party manufactures. 
We also have potential future milestone payments or royalty obligations to third parties under asset purchase, product development, license and other agreements as the timing and likelihood of such milestone payments are not known, and, in the case of royalty obligations, as the amount of such obligations are not estimable.  Our contingent obligations to third parties, in the form of development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, as of December 31, 2024 included $1,362.5 million under our license and collaboration agreement with Zymeworks, $1,255.0 million under our global license and collaboration agreement with Werewolf, $1,090.0 million under our license agreement with Sumitomo, $1,065.0 million under our asset purchase agreements with Redx, $752.5 million under our license and collaboration agreement with Autifony, $581.0 million under our amended license agreement with PharmaMar, $375.0 million under the asset purchase and exclusive license agreement with SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., $260.0 million in connection with our acquisition of Cavion, $155.5 million under our license agreement with Ligand, and $492.4 million related to other agreements.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates
A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  
Product Sales, Net
Product sales revenue is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time, which is typically on delivery to the customer or, in the case of products that are subject to consignment agreements, when the customer removes product from our consigned inventory location for shipment directly to a patient. 
Items Deducted from Gross Product Sales
.  
Revenues from sales of products are recorded net of government rebates and rebates under managed care plans and commercial payor contracts, estimated allowances for sales returns, government chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, patient coupon programs, and specialty distributor and wholesaler fees.  Calculating certain of these items involves estimates and judgments based on sales or invoice data, contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in applicable regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates and channel inventory data.  We review the adequacy of our provisions for sales deductions on a quarterly basis.  Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate and to reflect actual experience.  The most significant items deducted from gross product sales where we exercise judgment are rebates, sales returns and chargebacks.

Total items deducted from gross product sales were $1,238.2 million, $1,019.3 million and $966.0 million, or 24.5%, 21.4% and 21.0% as a percentage of gross product sales, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates.  
Rebates
We are subject to rebates on sales made under governmental managed-care pricing programs and commercial payor contracts in the U.S.  The largest of these rebates is associated with sales covered by commercial payor contracts and Epidiolex Medicaid.  We participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs under the terms of which discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities.  We offer rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations and commercial payors in the U.S.  In estimating our provisions for rebates, we consider relevant statutes with respect to governmental pricing programs and contractual sales terms with managed-care providers, commercial payors and group purchasing organizations.  We estimate the rebate provision based on historical utilization rates, historical payment experience, new information regarding changes in regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates and channel inventory data obtained from our major distributors in accordance with our inventory management agreements.  Estimating these rebates is complex, in part due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability.  We believe that the methodology we use to estimate rebates on product sales made under governmental managed-care pricing programs and commercial payor contracts is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances.  However, estimates may vary from actual experience.
Rebates were $820.9 million, $651.2 million and $630.3 million, or 16.2%, 13.7% and 13.7% as a percentage of gross product sales, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Rebates as a percentage of gross product sales in 2024 increased compared to 2023, primarily due to higher rebate rates with commercial payors.  Rebates as a percentage of gross product sales in 2023 were in line with 2022.  Rebates as a percentage of gross product sales are expected to increase in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to higher rebate rates in commercial payor contracts.
Sales returns
For certain products, we allow customers to return product within a specified period before and after the applicable expiration date and issue credits which may be applied against existing or future invoices.  We account for sales returns as a reduction in net revenue at the time a sale is recognized by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the estimated value of products expected to be returned.  The sales return accrual is estimated principally based on historical experience, the level and estimated shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel, our return policy and expected market events including generic competition.
Sales returns were $15.9 million, $2.5 million and $13.2 million, or 0.3%, 0.1% and 0.3% as a percentage of gross product sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Sales returns as a percentage of gross product sales are not expected to change materially in 2025 compared to 2024.
Chargebacks 
We participate in chargeback programs with a number of entities, principally Federal Supply Schedule, Group Purchasing Organizations, and other public parties, under which pricing on products below wholesalers’ list prices is provided to participating entities.  These entities purchase product through wholesalers at the contract price and the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower negotiated price.  We record the difference as allowances 
97
Table of Contents
against accounts receivable.  We determine our estimate of the chargebacks provision primarily based on historical experience on a product and program basis, current contract prices under the chargeback programs and channel inventory data.
Chargebacks were $212.4 million, $185.9 million and $135.9 million, or 4.2%, 3.9% and 2.9% as a percentage of gross product sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Chargebacks as a percentage of gross product sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher chargeback utilization.  Chargebacks as a percentage of gross product sales increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher chargeback utilization.  Chargebacks as a percentage of gross product sales are not expected to change materially in 2025 compared to 2024.
Discounts and distributor fees
Discounts and distributor fees comprise prompt payment discounts, patient coupon programs and specialty distributor and wholesaler fees.  We offer customers a cash discount on gross product sales as an incentive for prompt payment.  We estimate provisions for prompt pay discounts based on contractual sales terms with customers and historical payment experience.  To help patients afford our products, we have various programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs, a free product voucher program and co-pay coupon programs for certain products.  We estimate provisions for these programs primarily based on expected program utilization, adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience on a product and program basis.  Specialty distributor and wholesaler fees comprise fees for distribution of our products.  We estimate provisions for distributor and wholesaler fees primarily based on sales volumes and contractual terms with our distributors.
Discounts and distributor fees were $189.1 million, $179.7 million and $186.6 million, or 3.7%, 3.8% and 4.1% as a percentage of gross product sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Discounts and distributor fees as a percentage of gross product sales in 2024 were in line with 2023.  Discounts and distributor fees as a percentage of gross product sales in 2023 were broadly in line with 2022.  Discounts and distributor fees as a percentage of gross product sales are not expected to change materially in 2025 compared to 2024.
Acquisitions and Valuation of Intangibles
We make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations.  If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets.  We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities.  If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  We test goodwill for impairment annually in October and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products.  In performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value, including goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.  We have determined the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization, as determined by our traded share price, plus a control premium.  The control premium used was based on a review of such premiums identified in recent acquisitions of companies of similar size and in similar industries.  We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in October 2024 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill.  As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.7 billion of goodwill resulting from acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. 
In transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones generally is not recognized at the acquisition date.  In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPR&D projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use.  In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement.
Valuation of Intangible Assets
We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through asset acquisitions or business combinations.  When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date.  Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:
•
estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;
•
projecting regulatory approvals;
98
Table of Contents
•
estimating future cash flows including revenues and operating profits resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and
•
developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.
We believe the fair values that we assign to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.  No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected cash flows will transpire as estimated.  In addition, we are required to estimate the period of time over which to amortize the intangible assets, which requires significant judgment. 
Impairment of Intangible Assets
Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to sixteen years.  The estimated useful lives associated with intangible assets are consistent with the estimated lives of the products and may be modified when circumstances warrant.  Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted.  Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a product in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.  An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.  Estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves estimates and assumptions.  If our assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss or, in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense.
IPR&D is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value may be below the carrying value of the asset.  If the carrying value of the assets is not expected to be recovered, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $4.8 billion of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $3.3 billion related to the Epidiolex intangible asset which we acquired in the GW Acquisition and $1.0 billion related to the Vyxeos intangible asset which we acquired in the Celator Acquisition.  As part of our annual impairment assessment, we reviewed these intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 and determined the carrying value is recoverable.  Cash flow models used in our assessment are based on our commercial experience to date and require the use of significant estimates, which include, but are not limited to, patient-related assumptions, including patient population and segmentation, patient growth and treatment rates, and long-range pricing expectations.
We did not recognize an impairment charge related to our intangible assets in 2024 or 2023.  In 2022, we recorded an acquired IPR&D asset impairment charge of $133.6 million as a result of the decision to discontinue our nabiximols program.  
Please refer to Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, for further information about our intangible assets and the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024. 
Income Taxes 
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  We provide a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.  
Our most significant tax jurisdictions are Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S.  Certain estimates are required in determining our expense for income taxes.  Some of these estimates are based on management’s interpretations of jurisdiction-specific tax laws or regulations and the likelihood of settlement related to tax audit issues.  Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years’ items, the impact of accounting for share-based compensation, changes in our international organization, likelihood of settlement, and changes in overall levels of income before taxes.
Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, the amount and timing of which are uncertain.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including cumulative income in recent fiscal years, our forecast of future taxable income exclusive of certain reversing temporary differences and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business.  In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of certain temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.  
99

These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions, which are based on our commercial experience to date and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage our underlying business.  
We maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where realizability is not certain.  We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.  This determination depends on a variety of factors, some of which are subjective, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors.  If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period.
We have also provided for unrecognized tax benefits that we believe are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities.  The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.  We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions.  Our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more-likely-than-not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process.  We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews.  We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Interest Rate Risk
.  The primary objectives of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and competitive yield.  Although our investments are subject to market risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or certain types of investment.  Our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. federal government and federal agency securities, corporate bonds or commercial paper issued by U.S. corporations, money market instruments, certain qualifying money market mutual funds, certain repurchase agreements, and tax-exempt obligations of states, agencies and municipalities in the U.S.  Our cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2024 consisted of money market funds and time deposits which are not subject to significant interest rate risk.
We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates in connection with our term loan borrowings.  In May 2021 we entered into the Credit Agreement which provided for (i) the Dollar Term Loan, (ii) the Euro Term Loan and (iii) the Initial Revolving Credit Facility.  In January 2024, we entered into the Repricing Amendment No.1 to the Credit Agreement.  Upon entry into the Repricing Amendment No.1, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan into the Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans and we borrowed $201.9 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan that was not converted.  In July 2024, we entered into the Repricing Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No.1.  Upon entry into the Repricing Amendment No. 2, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans into the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans and we borrowed $289.6 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans that were not converted.  In November 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No.1 and Repricing Amendment No.2, to increase the Initial Revolving Credit Facility from $500.0 million to $885.0 million and extend the maturity date from May 5, 2026 to November 26, 2029.  
There were no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility or the Euro Term Loan as of December 31, 2024.  Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans borrowings of $2.7 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and subject to an either (a) Term SOFR, or (b) the prime lending rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans is 2.25% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 1.25% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate).  To achieve a desired mix of floating and fixed interest rates on our Tranche B-2 Dollar 
100
Table of Contents
Term Loans, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in April 2023.  The interest rate swap agreements have a notional amount of $500.0 million and are effective until April 2026.  As a result of these agreements, the interest rate on a portion of our term loan borrowings is fixed at 3.9086%, plus the borrowing spread, until April 30, 2026.  The net asset fair value of outstanding interest rate swap contracts was 
$1.0 million
 as of December 31, 2024.  The impact of a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts would be offset by a change in the value of the underlying liability.  If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1%, interest expense for 2025 would increase or decrease by approximately $15.5 million, based on the unhedged portion of our outstanding variable rate borrowings.
In September 2024, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes.  In April 2021, we issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes.  In June 2020, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes.
The 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the 2026 Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 3.125%, 4.375% and 2.000%, respectively, and we therefore do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the 2026 Notes.  However, the fair values of the 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the 2026 Notes are exposed to interest rate risk.  Generally, the fair values of the 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the 2026 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and 
decrease as interest rates rise.  The fair values of the 2030 Notes and the 2026 Notes are also affected by volatility in our ordinary share price.  As of December 31, 2024, the fair values of the 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the 2026 Notes were estimated to be $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively
.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
.  We have significant operations in Europe as well as in the U.S.  The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is generally the local currency.  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.  The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, and at the average exchange rate for the reporting period for revenue and expense accounts.  The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  The reported results of our foreign subsidiaries will be influenced by their translation into U.S. dollars by currency movements against the U.S. dollar.  Our primary currency translation exposure is related to our subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in sterling and euro.  A hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the rates used to translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in sterling and euro would have increased or decreased net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $78.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency.  Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.  The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the appropriate functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are reported in foreign exchange gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income (loss).  As of December 31, 2024, our exposure to transaction risk primarily related to sterling and euro denominated net monetary liabilities, including intercompany loans, held by subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency.  We have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage this currency risk.

These foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedges; gains and losses on these derivative instruments are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet exposures.  As of December 31, 2024, we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $461.2 million.  The net liability fair value of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $7.9 million as of December 31, 2024.  Based on our foreign currency exchange rate exposures as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would decrease the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts by approximately $6.9 million.  The resulting loss on these forward contracts would be offset by a positive impact on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
.  We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected.  Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
  During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  
The following report is provided by management in respect of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act):
1.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
2.
Our management used the COSO framework to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Management believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation of financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of our internal control over financial reporting, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.
3.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was effective.  There were no material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified by management.
4.
KPMG, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, included herein, and has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules at item 15(a)2 (collectively, ‘the consolidated financial statements’), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes and financial statement schedules at item 15(a)2 (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission”, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these (consolidated) financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Assessment of Epidiolex Medicaid Rebate Accrual
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, sales made under governmental and managed-care pricing programs and commercial payor contracts in the U.S. are subject to rebates and requires significant judgment in determining the sales utilization percentage used in calculating the Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual. As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reported rebates and other sales deductions of $342,717 thousands, which included rebates related to the Epidiolex Medicate rebate program in the U.S..
We identified the assessment of the Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual as a critical audit matter. Significant and complex auditor judgment was required to assess the Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual, specifically due to the significant judgment required in determining the sales utilization percentage used in the calculation of the Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual amount. 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.
- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual. 
F-1
Table of Contents
- We compared the Company’s historical Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual amount to the actual claims received to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. 
- We assessed the assumption for reasonableness by comparing it against a sales utilization percentage range that was independently developed based on historical utilization rates.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and include the accounts of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and our subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of businesses we have acquired from the date of each acquisition for the applicable reporting periods.
F-10
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.  The amendments are effective retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023.  The new guidance has not had a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.
Significant Risks and Uncertainties
We expect that our business will continue to meaningfully depend on oxybate revenues; however, there is no guarantee that oxybate revenues will remain at current levels.  In this regard, our ability to maintain oxybate revenues and realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in Xywav are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those related to the commercialization of Xywav for the treatment of IH in adults and adoption in that indication; competition from the introduction of two AG versions of high-sodium oxybate and a branded fixed-dose, high-sodium oxybate, Avadel’s Lumryz, for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy in the U.S. market, as well as potential future competition from additional AG versions of high-sodium oxybate and from generic versions of high-sodium oxybate and from other competitors; increased pricing pressure from, changes in policies by, or restrictions on reimbursement imposed by, third party payors, including our ability to maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for Xywav; increased rebates required to maintain access to our products; challenges to our intellectual property around Xywav and/or Xyrem, including from pending antitrust and intellectual property litigation; and continued acceptance of Xywav and Xyrem by physicians and patients.  A significant decline in oxybate revenues could cause us to reduce our operating expenses or seek to raise additional funds and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, including on our ability to acquire, in-license or develop new products to grow our business.
In addition to risks related specifically to Xywav and Xyrem, we are subject to other challenges and risks related to successfully commercializing a portfolio of oncology products and other neuroscience products, and other risks specific to our business and our ability to execute on our strategy, as well as risks and uncertainties common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry with development and commercial operations, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with: ongoing clinical research activity and related outcomes; obtaining regulatory approval of our late-stage product candidates; effectively commercializing our approved products such as Epidiolex, Rylaze, Zepzelca and Ziihera; obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; contracting and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and similar organizations that reduce our net revenue; increasing scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing and resulting changes in healthcare laws and policy; market acceptance; regulatory concerns with controlled substances generally and the potential for abuse; future legislation; action by the U.S. Federal Government authorizing the sale, distribution, use, and insurance reimbursement of non-FDA approved cannabinoid products; delays or problems in the supply of our products; loss of single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations; delays or problems with third parties that are part of our manufacturing and supply chain; identifying, acquiring or in-licensing additional products or product candidates; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired or in-licensed products or product candidates, such as Epidiolex and Ziihera, at the expected levels, with the expected costs and within the expected timeframe; pharmaceutical product development and the inherent uncertainty of clinical success; the challenges of protecting and enhancing our intellectual property rights; complying with applicable regulatory requirements; and possible restrictions on our ability and flexibility to pursue certain future opportunities as a result of our substantial outstanding debt obligations.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments and derivative contracts.  Our investment policy permits investments in U.S. federal government and federal agency securities, corporate bonds or commercial paper issued by U.S. corporations, money market instruments, certain qualifying money market mutual funds, certain repurchase agreements, and tax-exempt obligations of U.S. states, agencies and municipalities and places restrictions on credit ratings, maturities, and concentration by type and issuer.  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding our cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent recorded on the balance sheet.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We manage our foreign currency transaction risk and interest rate risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives.  All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.  
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $
461.2
 million and $
511.7
 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net liability fair value of $
7.9
 million and a net asset fair value of $
17.4
 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $
500.0
 million.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these outstanding interest rate swap contracts had a net asset fair value of $
1.0
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively.  
The counterparties to these contracts are large multinational commercial banks, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not significant.
We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales.  We monitor our exposure within accounts receivable and record a reserve against uncollectible accounts receivable as necessary.  We extend credit to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and specialty pharmaceutical distribution companies, primarily in the U.S., and to other international distributors and hospitals.  Customer creditworthiness is monitored and collateral is not required.  We monitor economic conditions in certain European countries which may result in variability of the timing of cash receipts and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding. 
 Historically, we have not experienced significant credit losses on our accounts receivable and as of December 31, 2024, allowances on receivables were not material.  As of December 31, 2024, five customers accounted for 
80
% of gross accounts receivable, including ESSDS, which accounted for 
39
% of gross accounts receivable, ASD, which accounted for 
15
% of gross accounts receivable and McKesson, which accounted for 
13
% of gross accounts receivable.  As of December 31, 2023, five customers accounted for 
79
% of gross accounts receivable, including ESSDS, which accounted for 
41
% of gross accounts receivable, ASD, which accounted for 
13
% of gross accounts receivable and McKesson, which accounted for 
11
% of gross accounts receivable.
We depend on single source suppliers for most of our products, product candidates and their APIs.  With respect to our oxybate products, the API is manufactured for us by a single source supplier and the finished products are manufactured both by us in our facility in Athlone, Ireland and by our U.S.-based supplier.
Business Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of an acquired business from the date of acquisition.  We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting.  The acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires, among other things, that assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired business be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions, and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D, be recorded on the balance sheet.  Also, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.  Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  Contingent consideration is included within the acquisition cost and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date.  A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
Cash Equivalents and Investments
We consider all highly liquid investments, readily convertible to cash, that mature within three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments consist of time deposits with initial maturities of greater than three months.  Collectively, cash equivalents and investments are considered available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  We use the specific-identification method for calculating realized gains and losses on securities sold.  Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on investments are included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income (loss).
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We record the fair value of derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction.  For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item. 
For derivatives formally designated as hedges, we assess both at inception and quarterly thereafter, whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. 
F-12
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs.  If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. 
We designate cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks related to our borrowings denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in foreign exchange gain (loss) within the consolidated statements of income (loss), along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged item.  We have elected to exclude the total forward points or currency basis from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and account for them as excluded components.  The initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to foreign exchange gain (loss) and the difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).
Derivatives that are not designated and do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current e
arnings.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all inventories.  Our policy is to write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements.  The estimate of excess quantities is subjective and primarily dependent on our estimates of future demand for a particular product.  If our estimate of future demand changes, we consider the impact on the reserve for excess inventory and adjust the reserve as required.  Increases in the reserve are recorded as charges in cost of product sales. 
We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development.  The determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.  We had no pre-approval inventory on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Our inventory production process for our cannabinoid products includes the cultivation of botanical raw material.  Because of the duration of the cultivation process, a portion of our inventory will not be sold within one year.  Consistent with the practice in other industries that cultivate botanical raw materials, all inventory is classified as a current asset.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings
40
 years
Manufacturing equipment and machinery
4
-
20
 years
Computer software and equipment
3
-
7
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the noncancelable term of our leases or their economic useful lives.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Leases are classified at lease commencement as either operating leases or finance leases.  Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment, net, and finance lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.  Lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.  In determining the net present value of lease payments, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date.  The lease asset also includes any lease payments made, reduced by lease incentives and increased by initial direct costs incurred.  Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.  Operating lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Finance lease expense is recognized as depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment and interest expense on finance lease liabilities.
F-13
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.  For vehicle leases we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 
We have elected the short-term lease exemption and, therefore, do not recognize a lease asset or corresponding liability for lease arrangements with an original term of 12 months or less.  Rent expense under short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products.  In performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value, including goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.  We test goodwill for impairment annually in October and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development
The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use.  The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset, or discontinued, at which point the intangible asset will be written off.  Development costs incurred after an acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of purchased developed technology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 
seven
 to 
sixteen years
.  The estimated useful lives associated with finite-lived intangible assets are consistent with the estimated lives of the associated products and may be modified when circumstances warrant.  Such assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.  The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is comprised of product sales, net and royalties and contract revenues.  Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  Prior to recognizing revenue, we make estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint.  Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
Product Sales, Net
Product sales revenue is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time, which is typically on delivery to the customer or, in the case of products that are subject to consignment agreements, when the customer removes product from our consigned inventory location for shipment directly to a patient.  
Reserves for Variable Consideration
Revenues from sales of products are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which relate to returns, specialty distributor fees, wholesaler fees, prompt payment discounts, government rebates, government chargebacks, coupon programs and rebates under managed care plans and commercial payor contracts.  Calculating certain of these reserves involves estimates and judgments and we determine their expected value based on sales or invoice data, contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data.  These reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract.  A large portion of the reserve relates to rebates where there is significant judgment, in particular in the determination of the sales utilization percentage used to calculate the Epidiolex Medicaid rebate accrual.  The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of 
F-14
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period.  We reassess our reserves for variable consideration at each reporting date.  Historically, adjustments to estimates for these reserves have not been material.
Reserves for returns, specialty distributor fees, wholesaler fees, government rebates, coupon programs and rebates under managed care plans and commercial payor contracts are included within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.  Reserves for government chargebacks and prompt payment discounts are shown as a reduction in accounts receivable.
Royalties and Contract Revenues
We enter into out-licensing agreements under which we license certain rights to our products or product candidates to third parties.  If a licensing arrangement includes multiple goods or services, we consider whether the license is distinct.  If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license.  If the license to our intellectual property is determined not to be distinct, it is combined with other goods or services into a combined performance obligation.  We consider whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees.  We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting date and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method.  If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price.  Milestone payments that are not within our control or that of the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.  The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.  At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties and milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties and sales-based milestones relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty or sales-based milestone has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
Cost of Product Sales
Cost of product sales includes manufacturing and distribution costs, the cost of drug substance, royalties due to third parties on product sales, product liability and cargo insurance, FDA user fees, freight, shipping, handling and storage costs and salaries and related costs of employees involved with production.
  Excluded from cost of product sales shown on the consolidated statements of income (loss) is amortization of acquired developed technology of $
627.3
 million, $
608.3
 million and $
599.2
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to clinical studies and outside services, personnel expenses, and other research and development costs, including milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval of products.  Clinical study and outside services costs relate primarily to services performed by clinical research organizations, clinical studies performed at clinical sites, materials and supplies, and other third party fees.  Personnel expenses relate primarily to salaries, benefits and share-based compensation.  Other research and development expenses primarily include overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  For product candidates that have not been approved by FDA, inventory used in clinical trials is expensed at the time of production and recorded as research and development expense.  For products that have been approved by FDA, inventory used in clinical trials is expensed at the time the inventory is packaged for the trial.
Advertising Expenses
We expense the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred.
  Advertising expenses were $
107.4
 million, $
92.2
 million and $
108.8
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and 
F-15
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.  We recognize the benefits of a tax position if it is more-likely-than-not of being sustained.  A recognized tax benefit is then measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  Interest and penalties related to income taxes are included in income tax expense and classified with the related liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign Currency
Our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.  The assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date with the results of operations of subsidiaries translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the reporting period.  The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary at the weighted average exchange rate for the reporting period.  Any monetary assets and liabilities arising from these transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date or on settlement.  Resulting gains and losses are recorded in foreign exchange gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are reported at cost, less accumulated amortization and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt, with the exception of deferred financing costs associated with revolving-debt arrangements which are presented as assets.  The related amortization expense is included in interest expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

Contingencies
From time to time, we may become involved in claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated.  Legal fees and other expenses related to litigation are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Share-Based Compensation 
We account for compensation cost for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant.  The fair value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method.  The estimation of share-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and, to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised.  We primarily consider historical experience when estimating expected forfeitures.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards
PRSUs awarded to employees vest upon the achievement of certain performance criteria at the end of a specified performance period.  For PRSUs granted prior to 2024, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a TSR modifier.  For PRSUs granted in 2024, the relative TSR modifier represents one of the performance metrics.  The estimated fair value of these PRSUs is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Compensation expense for PRSUs is recognized from the date the Company determines the performance criteria probable of being achieved to the date the award, or relevant portion of the award, is expected to vest.  Cumulative adjustments are recorded on a quarterly basis to reflect subsequent changes to the estimated outcome of the performance criteria until the date results are determined.
Variable Interest Entity
In 2021, we invested in a protected cell as part of our directors’ and officers’ liability risk financing strategy.  Based on our control and the structure of the protected cell, we concluded that Jazz is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the protected cell.
  There was 
no
 insurance premium payable to the protected cell for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and it was

Collaborations and Disposition
License Agreements
In February 2024, we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Redx to acquire global rights to a KRAS inhibitor program.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $
10.0
 million to Redx which was recorded as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Redx is eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments of up to $
870.0
 million and, if a product is approved, a tiered, mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of that product.
In November 2023, we entered into an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement with Autifony to discover and develop drug candidates targeting two different ion channel targets associated with neurological disorders.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $
18.0
 million to Autifony, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Autifony is eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments of up to $
752.5

In October 2022, we entered into an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement with Zymeworks providing us the right to acquire development and commercialization rights to Zymeworks' zanidatamab across all indications in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks.  In December 2022, we exercised the option to continue with the exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab.  Zanidatamab is a bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, known as biparatopic binding.  Under the terms of the agreement, Zymeworks received an upfront payment of $
50.0
 million and, following our decision to continue the collaboration after the readout of the top-line clinical data from HERIZON-BTC-01, a second, one-time payment of $
325.0
 million.  We recorded the $
375.0
 million as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.  In November 2024, we announced FDA accelerated approval of Ziihera for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive biliary tract cancer, triggering a regulatory milestone payment of $
25.0
 million, which was capitalized as an intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet.  Zymeworks is also eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $
1.4
 billion, for total potential payments of $
1.8
 billion, as well as incremental tiered royalties on future net sales of Ziihera ranging from 
10
% to 
20
%. 
In May 2022, we entered into a licensing agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Europe and other territories for DSP-0187, now referred to as JZP441.  JZP441 is a potent, highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist with potential application for the treatment of narcolepsy, IH and other sleep disorders.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $
50.0
 million to Sumitomo, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Sumitomo is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $
1.09
 billion and, if JZP441 is approved, a tiered, low double-digit royalty on Jazz's net sales of JZP441.
In April 2022, we entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Werewolf to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to Werewolf's investigational WTX-613, now referred to as JZP898.  JZP898 is a differentiated, conditionally-activated interferon alpha (IFNα) INDUKINE™ molecule.  We made an upfront payment of $
15.0
 million to Werewolf in 2022, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a milestone payment of $
5.0
 million in September 2023 which was recorded within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Werewolf is eligible to receive further development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $
1.26
 billion and, if JZP898 is approved, a tiered, mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of JZP898.

Sunosi Disposition
In March 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest Sunosi to Axsome.  In May 2022, we completed the U.S. divestiture and in November 2022, the ex-U.S. divestiture was completed.  Under the terms of the sale agreement, Axsome received the rights to Sunosi in all of the existing territories available to us.  We received an upfront payment of $
53.0
 million, and have the right to receive a high single-digit royalty on Axsome’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi in current indications and a mid-single-digit royalty on Axsome’s U.S. net sales of Sunosi in future indications.  
Upon closing, we recognized a loss on disposal of $
40.8
 million within 
selling, general and administrative expenses
 in our consolidated statements of income (loss) in the year ended December 31, 2022.  We are accounting for the contingent consideration in the form of the future royalty as it is earned.  
We determined that the disposal of Sunosi did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our available-for-sale securities included money market funds and time deposits and their carrying values were approximately equal to their fair values.  Money market funds were measured using quoted prices in active markets, which represent Level 1 inputs and time deposits were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  Level 2 inputs are obtained from various third party data providers and represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, or these inputs were derived from observable market data, or if not directly observable, were derived from or corroborated by other observable market data.  
Our derivative assets and liabilities include interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives that are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk as well as an evaluation of our counterparties’ credit risks.  Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy in 2024 or in 2023.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of investments measured using the measurement alternative for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value was $
4.3
 million and $
4.7
 million, respectively.  The carrying amount, which is recorded within other non-current assets, is based on the latest observable transaction price.
As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair values of the 2026 Notes, the 2030 Notes, the Secured Notes and the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans were $

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We are exposed to certain risks arising from operating internationally, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates primarily related to the translation of sterling and euro denominated net monetary liabilities, including intercompany balances, held by subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency and fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding term loan borrowings.  We manage these exposures within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives.  All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of up to 12 months, designed to limit the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates related to the translation of certain non-U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, including intercompany balances.  Hedge accounting is not applied to these derivative instruments as gains and losses on these hedge transactions are designed to offset gains and losses on underlying balance sheet exposures.  
As of

To achieve a desired mix of floating and fixed interest rates on our variable rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in April 2023 which are effective until April 2026.  These agreements hedge contractual term loan interest rates.  As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate swap agreements had a notional amount of $

In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with our Euro Term Loan, we entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap contract in May 2021, which matured in March 2022, and was de-designated as a fair value hedge.  The terms of this contract converted the principal repayments and interest payments on the Euro Term Loan into U.S. dollars.  The carrying amount of the Euro Term Loan and the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swap contract were remeasured on a monthly basis, with changes in the euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates recognized within foreign exchange gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

The decrease in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the negative impact of foreign currency translation adjustments due to the weakening of sterling and euro against the U.S. dollar.
The assumptions and estimates used to determine future cash flows and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective.  They can be affected by various factors, including external factors, such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.
Based on finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024, and assuming the underlying assets will not be impaired and that we will not change the expected lives of any other assets, future amortization expenses were estimated as follows (in thousands):

Credit Agreement
On May 5, 2021, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, Jazz Lux, and certain of our other subsidiaries, as borrowers, or, collectively with Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and Jazz Lux, the “Borrowers”, entered into the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) the Dollar Term Loan, which was drawn by Jazz Lux on the closing date thereof in U.S. dollars (ii) the Euro Term Loan, which was drawn by Jazz Lux on the closing date thereof in Euros and (iii) the Initial Revolving Credit Facility.
We used the proceeds from the Dollar Term Loan (i) to repay in full $
575.9
 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, (ii) to fund, in part, the cash consideration payable in connection with the GW Acquisition and (iii) to pay related fees and expenses.  Upon the repayment in full of loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement, it was terminated and all guarantees and liens thereunder were released.
In 2021, we made voluntary prepayments on the Euro Term Loan totaling €
416.7
 million, or $
502.0
 million, and in March 2022 we repaid the remaining outstanding principal of €
208.3
 million, or $
251.0
 million.  The Euro Term Loan bore interest at the EURIBOR plus an applicable margin.  During the term of the Euro Term Loan, the interest rate and effective interest rate were 
4.43
% and 
4.93
%, respectively. 
In January 2024, Jazz Lux entered into the Repricing Amendment No.1 to the Credit Agreement.  Upon entry into the Repricing Amendment No.1, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan into the Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans, and Jazz Lux borrowed $
201.9
 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Dollar Term Loan that was not converted.  
In July 2024, Jazz Lux entered into the Repricing Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No. 1.  Upon entry into Repricing Amendment No. 2, certain existing lenders converted a portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans into the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, and Jazz Lux borrowed $
289.6
 million aggregate principal amount of additional Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay the portion of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans that were not converted.
The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans are a separate class of term loans under the Credit Agreement, as amended by Repricing Amendment No. 1 and Repricing Amendment No. 2, with the same material terms (including with respect to maturity, prepayment, security, covenants and events of default) as the previously outstanding Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans and the initial Dollar Term Loan incurred on May 5, 2021, with the interest rate amended as described below and the credit spread adjustment removed.  The principal amount of Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans outstanding immediately prior to the Repricing Amendment No. 2 and the outstanding principal amount of Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans immediately following the Repricing Amendment No.2, each totaled $
2.7
 billion.  
The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) Term SOFR or (b) the prime lending rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans is 
2.25
% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 
1.25
% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate), a decrease, in each case, of 
75
 basis points from the applicable margin on the Tranche B-1 Dollar Term Loans.  The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans are subject to a Term SOFR floor of 
0.50
%.  As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate and effective interest rate on the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans were 
6.61
% and 
8.27
%, respectively.  
In November 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Repricing Amendment No. 1 and Repricing Amendment No. 2, to increase the Initial Revolving Credit Facility from $
500.0
 million to $
885.0
 million and extend the maturity date, or Amended Revolving Credit Facility, from May 5, 2026 to November 26, 2029 (such date, the “Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date”), provided that:
•
if, as of any date from March 16, 2026 to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes (any such date, the “2026 Notes Springing Maturity Date”), (x) any 2026 Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof with a maturity date that is not later than the date that is 
91
 days after the Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date) (any such indebtedness, the “2026 Maturity Indebtedness”) remain outstanding and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and its subsidiaries is less than an amount equal to 
125
% of the aggregate principal amount of 2026 Maturity Indebtedness outstanding, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to the 2026 Notes Springing Maturity Date;
•
if, as of February 4, 2028, (x) more than $
500,000,000
 of the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (and any extended term loans, refinancing term loans, refinancing notes and permitted refinancing indebtedness, in each case, in respect thereof) (any such indebtedness, the “Term Loan Indebtedness”) remains outstanding and (y) the maturity date of such Term Loan Indebtedness is not later than the date that is 
91
 days after 
F-25
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
the Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to February 4, 2028; and
•
if, as of October 16, 2028 (such date, the “Senior Notes Springing Maturity Date”), (x) more than $
500,000,000
 of the Secured Notes (and permitted refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) (any such indebtedness, the “Senior Note Indebtedness”) remains outstanding and (y) the maturity date with respect to such Senior Note Indebtedness is not later than the date that is 
91
 days after the Amended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the maturity date for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be shortened to October 16, 2028.
Initially, the applicable margin for the loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be 
2.00
% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 
1.00
% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate).  Thereafter, the applicable margin for the Amended Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 
1.75
% to 
2.75
% (in the case of Term SOFR borrowings) and 
0.75
% to 
1.75
% (in the case of borrowings at the prime lending rate), depending on our first lien secured net leverage ratio level, and any loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are subject to a Term SOFR floor of 
0.00
%.  The Amended Revolving Credit Facility has a commitment fee payable on the undrawn amount ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.45
% per annum based upon our first lien secured net leverage ratio.  As of December 31, 2024, we had an undrawn Amended Revolving Credit Facility totaling $
885.0
 million.
We may make voluntary prepayments at any time without payment of a premium or penalty, subject to certain exceptions, and are required to make certain mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement in certain circumstances.  Principal repayments of the Dollar Term Loan, which were due quarterly, began in September 2021 and were equal to 
1.0
% per annum of the original principal amount of $
3.1
 billion with any remaining balance payable on the maturity date.  In September 2022, we made a voluntary repayment on the Dollar Term Loan totaling $
300.0
 million.  In January 2025, we made a voluntary repayment on the Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans totaling $
750.0
 million.  The Tranche B-2 Dollar Term Loans will amortize in quarterly installments equal to 
0.286294791
% of the initial aggregate principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance payable on May 5, 2028.
Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and any hedging or cash management obligations entered into with any lender thereunder are guaranteed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, the other borrowers, and each of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc’s other existing or subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions), or the Guarantors.  We refer to the Borrowers and the Guarantors collectively as the “Loan Parties.”
The Loan Parties’ obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other exceptions, by a security interest in (a) all tangible and intangible assets of the Loan Parties, except for certain excluded assets, and (b) all of the equity interests of the subsidiaries of the Loan Parties held by the Loan Parties.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc
 and its restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of junior indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.  The Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc
 and its restricted subsidiaries to (a) not exceed a maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio and (b) not fall below a minimum interest coverage ratio, provided that such covenants apply only to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and are applicable only if amounts are drawn (or non-cash collateralized letters of credit in excess of $
50.0
 million are outstanding) under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.  The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, failure to make payments, breach of covenants and breach of representations.
2029 Senior Secured Notes 
On April

29,

2021, Jazz Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, closed the offering of the Secured Notes in a private placement.  We used the proceeds from the Secured Notes to fund, in part, the cash consideration payable in connection with the GW Acquisition. 
Interest on the Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January

15 and July

15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2022, at a rate of 
4.375
% per year.  The Secured Notes mature on January 15, 2029.
The Secured Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and each of its restricted subsidiaries, other than Jazz Securities, that is a borrower, or a guarantor, under the Amended Credit Agreement.  The Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured by a first priority lien (subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions), equally and ratably with the Amended Credit Agreement, on the collateral securing the Amended Credit Agreement.
Some or all of the Secured Notes, may be redeemed at any time and from time to time at a specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, to the redemption date.  In addition, Jazz Securities may redeem all 
F-26
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
but not part of the Secured Notes at its option at any time in connection with certain tax-related events at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Secured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If Jazz undergoes a change of control, Jazz Securities will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 
101
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to certain exceptions. 
The indenture governing the Secured Notes contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants applicable to Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and its restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of junior indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.  If Jazz Securities or Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc’s restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, Jazz Securities will be required under certain circumstances to make an offer to purchase the Secured Notes at 
100
% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  
As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate and effective interest rate on the Secured Notes were 
4.375
% and 
4.64
%, respectively.
2030 Notes  
In September 2024, Jazz Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc
, completed a private placement of $
1.0
 billion principal amount of the 2030 Notes.  
Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2025, at a rate of 
3.125
% per year.  In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay additional amounts as a result of any applicable tax withholding or deductions required in respect of payments on the 2030 Notes.  The 2030 Notes mature on September 15, 2030, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased.
The holders of the 2030 Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2030 Notes for cash at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date in the event we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes), such as specified change of control transactions, our liquidation or dissolution or the delisting of our ordinary shares from any of The New York Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market (or any of their respective successors).  
Additionally, the terms and covenants in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes include certain events of default after which the 2030 Notes may be due and payable immediately.  
Prior to September 15, 2030, we may redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole but not in part, in connection with certain tax-related events.  We also may redeem the 2030 Notes on or after September 20, 2027 and prior to June 15, 2030, in whole or in part (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes), if the last reported sale price per ordinary share has been at least 
130
% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The 2030 Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 6.5339 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $
153.05
 per ordinary share.  Upon exchange of the 2030 Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, ordinary shares or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes being exchanged.  The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain make-whole fundamental changes (as defined in the indenture related to the 2030 Notes) that occur prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its 2030 Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change or exchange its 2030 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period.  Prior to June 15, 2030, the 2030 Notes will be exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
As of December 31, 2024, the “if converted value” did not exceed the principal amount of the 2030 Notes.

The total liability is reflected net of issuance costs of $

2026 Notes 
In 2020 we completed a private placement of $
1.0

332.9
 million aggregate principal amount of the 
1.875
% exchangeable senior notes due 2021, through privately-negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the 2026 Notes.  Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2020, at a rate of 
2.00
% per year.  In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay additional amounts as a result of any applicable tax withholding or deductions required in respect of payments on the 2026 Notes.  The 2026 Notes mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed.
The holders of the 2026 Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes for cash in the event we undergo certain fundamental changes, such as specified change of control transactions, our liquidation or dissolution or the delisting of our ordinary shares from any of The New York Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market (or any of their respective successors).  Additionally, the terms and covenants in the indenture related to the 2026 Notes include certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be due and payable immediately.  Prior to June 15, 2026, we may redeem the 2026 Notes, in whole but not in part, subject to compliance with certain conditions, if we have, or on the next interest payment date would, become obligated to pay to the holder of any 2026 Notes additional amounts as a result of certain tax-related events.  We also may redeem the 2026 Notes prior to March 15, 2026, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price per ordinary share has been at least 
130
% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide the notice of redemption.
The 2026 Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 6.4182 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $
155.81
 per ordinary share.  On July 22, 2024, we irrevocably elected to fix the settlement method for exchanges of the 2026 Notes to a combination of cash and ordinary shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc with a specified cash amount per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged equal to or in excess of $
1,000
.  As a result, for any 2026 Notes exchanged subsequent to such notice, an exchanging holder will receive (i) up to $
1,000
 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged and (ii) cash, ordinary shares, or any combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of $
1,000
 per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged.  The exchange rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain make-whole fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, we will in certain circumstances increase the exchange rate for holders of the 2026 Notes who elect to exchange their 2026 Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period.  Prior to March 15, 2026, the 2026 Notes will be exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.  
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the “if converted value” did not exceed the principal amount of the 2026 Notes.
The total liability is reflected net of issuance costs of $
15.3
 million which will be amortized over the term of the 2026 Notes.  We have determined the expected life of the 2026 Notes to be equal to the original 
six-year

 million principal amount of 2024 Notes.  We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $
500.0
 million in outstanding loans under the Initial Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses.  We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Interest on the 2024 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2018, at a rate of 
1.50
% per year.  The 2024 Notes were exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 4.5659 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes, which was equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $
219.02
 per ordinary share.  
On August 15, 2024, the maturity date for the 2024 Notes, we repaid the $
575.0
 million aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnification
In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification, including indemnification associated with product liability or infringement of intellectual property rights.  Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves future claims that may be made but have not yet been made against us.  To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to these indemnification obligations.
We have agreed to indemnify our executive officers, directors and certain other employees for losses and costs incurred in connection with certain events or occurrences, including advancing money to cover certain costs, subject to certain limitations.  The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we maintain insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.  Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe the fair value of these indemnification obligations is not significant.  Accordingly, we did not recognize any liabilities relating to these obligations as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  No assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
Other Commitments 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
46.3
 million of noncancelable purchase commitments due within one year, primarily related to agreements with third party manufacturers.
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in legal proceedings, including the following matters:
Xyrem Antitrust Litigation
From June 2020 to May 2022, a number of lawsuits were filed on behalf of purported direct and indirect Xyrem purchasers, alleging that the patent litigation settlement agreements we entered with generic drug manufacturers who had filed ANDAs violate state and federal antitrust and consumer protection laws, as follows:

The plaintiffs in certain of these lawsuits are seeking to represent a class of direct purchasers of Xyrem, and the plaintiffs in the remaining lawsuits are seeking to represent a class of indirect purchasers of Xyrem.  Each of the lawsuits generally alleges violations of U.S. federal and state antitrust, consumer protection, and unfair competition laws in connection with the Company Defendants’ conduct related to Xyrem, including actions leading up to, and entering into, patent litigation settlement agreements with each of the other named defendants.  Each of the lawsuits seeks monetary damages, exemplary damages, equitable relief against the alleged unlawful conduct, including disgorgement of profits and restitution, and injunctive relief.  It is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed against the Company Defendants making similar or related allegations.  If the plaintiffs were to be successful in their claims, they may be entitled to injunctive relief or we may be required to pay significant monetary damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Patent Infringement Litigation
Avadel Litigation
On May 13, 2021, we filed a patent infringement suit against Avadel, and several of its corporate affiliates in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The suit alleges that Avadel’s 
Lumryz
 will infringe 
five
 of our patents related to controlled release formulations of oxybate and the safe and effective distribution of oxybate.  The suit seeks an injunction to prevent Avadel from launching a product that would infringe these patents, and an award of monetary damages if Avadel does launch an infringing product.  Avadel filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid 
F-33
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
or not enforceable, and that its product will not infringe our patents.  Avadel filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings on its counterclaim that 
one
 of our patents should be delisted from the Orange Book.

On November 18, 2022, the Court issued an order that we delist the patent from the Orange Book.  On November 22, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit temporarily stayed the District Court’s delisting order.  On February 24, 2023, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s delisting order, lifted the temporary stay, and gave Jazz 
14
 days to request that FDA delist the patent from the Orange Book.  Jazz complied with the Federal Circuit’s order and requested delisting on February 28, 2023.  On March 3, 2023, we and Avadel stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of the claims and counterclaims related to infringement and validity of the delisted patent in both this suit and a later-filed suit described below related to the same patent.
On August 4, 2021, we filed an additional patent infringement suit against Avadel in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The second suit alleges that Avadel’s 
Lumryz
 will infringe a newly-issued patent related to sustained-release formulations of oxybate.  The suit seeks an injunction to prevent Avadel from launching a product that would infringe this patent, and an award of monetary damages if Avadel does launch an infringing product.  Avadel filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid or not enforceable, and that its product will not infringe our patents.  
On November 10, 2021, we filed an additional patent infringement suit against Avadel in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The third suit alleges that Avadel’s 
Lumryz
 will infringe a newly-issued patent related to sustained-release formulations of oxybate.  The suit seeks an injunction to prevent Avadel from launching a product that would infringe this patent, and an award of monetary damages if Avadel does launch an infringing product.  Avadel filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid or not enforceable, and that its product will not infringe our patents.
On April 14, 2022, Avadel sued us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  Avadel’s suit alleges that we misappropriated trade secrets related to Avadel’s once-nightly sodium oxybate development program and breached certain contracts between the parties.  Avadel seeks monetary damages, an injunction preventing us from using Avadel’s confidential information, and an order directing the United States Patent and Trademark Office to modify the inventorship of one of our oxybate patents.  On July 8, 2022, we filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the Court denied on July 18, 2023.  
The denial is not a ruling that Jazz misappropriated Avadel‘s trade secrets or breached any contract.  The case will go forward in discovery and the Court instructed the parties to submit a proposed scheduling order.
On June 7, 2022, we received notice from Avadel that it had filed a "paragraph IV certification" regarding 
one
 patent listed in the Orange Book for Xyrem.  A paragraph IV certification is a certification by a generic applicant that alleges that patents covering the branded product are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic product.  On July 15, 2022, we filed an additional lawsuit against Avadel asserting infringement of that patent.  The suit alleges that the filing of Avadel’s application for approval of FT218 is an act of infringement, and that Avadel’s product would infringe the patent if launched.  The suit seeks an injunction to prevent Avadel from launching a product that would infringe the patent, and an award of damages if Avadel does launch an infringing product.  Avadel filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patent is invalid, that its product would not infringe, and that by listing the patent in the Orange Book, we engaged in unlawful monopolization in violation of the Sherman Act.  On December 9, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss Avadel’s counterclaims.
  On June 29, 2023, we filed a motion seeking leave to supplement our motion to dismiss, as well as a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss.  
As noted above, on March 3, 2023, we and Avadel stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of the claims and counterclaims related to infringement and validity of the delisted patent.
On November 1, 2023, the Court held a claim construction hearing relating to disputed terms in the asserted patents. 

On December 15, 2023, the Court issued a written opinion and order resolving the parties’ remaining claim construction disputes.
  On November 20, 2023, we and Avadel each filed motions for summary judgment.  On February 14, 2024, the Court issued a written opinion and order denying both parties’ motions for summary judgment.
Trial regarding our patent infringement claims against Avadel began on February 26, 2024, and concluded on March 4, 2024, with the jury finding both of our asserted patents valid, and awarding us damages for infringement for Avadel’s past sales of Lumryz.

On April 12, 2024, we filed a motion for a permanent injunction and ongoing royalties.
  On August 27, 2024, the Court granted our motion for an injunction in part, 
and requested additional briefing about ongoing royalties.

The issued injunction prevents 
Avadel from seeking FDA approval or marketing Lumryz for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia or other indications not already a part of Lumryz’s product labeling as of March 4, 2024, and enjoins Avadel from infringing in any way Claim 24 of our ’782 patent by making, using or selling Lumryz through and including the February 2036 expiration date of the ’782 patent, subject to certain exclusions including, among other things (i) for the treatment of narcolepsy, (ii) for the treatment of patients who have been prescribed Lumryz as of the effective date of the 
F-34
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
injunction conditioned on the payment of an amount to be determined and (iii) in clinical trials and studies ongoing as of the effective date of the injunction.  The Court also granted our motion for an ongoing royalty for any future sale of Lumryz to patients with narcolepsy at a rate to be determined based upon further briefing by the parties on the appropriate ongoing rate above 
3.5
%.  
Avadel is appealing this injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The Federal Circuit held oral argument on this appeal on February 7, 2025, but has not yet  issued a decision.

Avadel filed a motion with the district court for a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which the district court denied.

Avadel also filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal with the Federal Circuit, which the Federal Circuit granted to the limited extent that the injunction enjoins initiating new clinical trials or studies and denied in all other respects.

The Court scheduled a trial regarding Avadel’s counterclaims for unlawful monopolization for November 3, 2025 and a trial regarding Avadel’s trade secret misappropriation claims for December 15, 2025.  On March 13, 2024 and March 19, 2024, we filed motions to stay Avadel’s unlawful monopolization counterclaim and trade secret claims, respectively, pending resolution of post-trial motions and potential appeals in the patent infringement suit.  On May 24, 2024, the Court denied the motion to stay the unlawful monopolization counterclaim and the previously-filed motion to dismiss the same.

On June 7, 2024, we filed a motion for reargument or, in the alternative, to certify the decision for interlocutory appeal.

That motion remains pending and no hearing date has been set.  The Court stayed Avadel’s trade secret misappropriation claims pending appeal of the injunction in the related patent matter.

We filed a further motion to stay the unlawful monopolization counterclaims, which remains pending.
On July 21, 2022, Avadel filed a lawsuit against FDA

in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging FDA’s determination that Avadel was required to file a paragraph IV certification regarding one of our Orange Book listed patents.

Avadel filed a motion for preliminary injunction or, in the alternative, summary judgment, seeking relief including a declaration that FDA’s decision requiring patent certification was unlawful, an order setting aside that decision, an injunction prohibiting FDA from requiring such certification as a precondition to approval of its application for FT218, and an order requiring FDA to take final action on Avadel’s application for approval of FT218 within 
14
 days of the Court’s ruling.

On July 27, 2022, we filed a motion to intervene in that case, which the Court granted.  
The Court held a hearing on the parties’ respective motions for summary judgment on October

7,

2022.  On November

3,

2022, the Court granted our and FDA’s motions for summary judgment and denied Avadel’s motion.
From December 2024 through February 2025, Avadel filed a series of patent infringement suits against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The suits allege that Jazz’s sales of Xywav infringe on certain newly-issued Avadel patents, and Avadel seeks an award of monetary damages.  We have not yet responded to these lawsuits.
Xywav Patent Litigation
In June 2021, we received notice from Lupin, that it has filed with FDA an ANDA, for a generic version of Xywav.  The notice from Lupin included a paragraph IV certification with respect to 
ten
 of our patents listed in FDA’s Orange Book for Xywav on the date of our receipt of the notice.  The asserted patents relate generally to the composition and method of use of Xywav, and methods of treatment when Xywav is administered concomitantly with certain other medications.
In July 2021, we filed a patent infringement suit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The complaint alleges that by filing its ANDA, Lupin has infringed 
ten
 of our Orange Book listed patents.  We are seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Lupin from introducing a generic version of Xywav that would infringe our patents.  As a result of this lawsuit, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 
30
 months will be imposed by FDA on Lupin's ANDA.  In June 2021, FDA recognized 
seven years
 of Orphan Drug Exclusivity for Xywav through July 21, 2027.  On October

4,

2021, Lupin filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid or not enforceable, and that its product, if approved, will not infringe our patents.
In April 2022, we received notice from Lupin that it had filed a paragraph IV certification regarding a newly-issued patent listed in the Orange Book for Xywav.  On May 11, 2022, we filed an additional lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that by filing its ANDA, Lupin infringed the newly-issued patent related to a method of treatment when Xywav is administered concomitantly with certain other medications.  The suit seeks a permanent injunction to prevent Lupin from introducing a generic version of Xywav that would infringe our patent.  On June 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the 
two
 lawsuits we filed against Lupin.  
In November 2022, we received notice from Lupin that it had filed a paragraph IV certification regarding a newly-issued patent listed in the Orange Book for Xywav.  On January

2023, we filed an additional lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that by filing its ANDA, Lupin infringed the newly-issued patent referenced in its November 2022 paragraph IV certification, as well as another patent that issued in January 2023.  The suit seeks a permanent injunction to prevent Lupin from introducing a generic version of Xywav that would infringe the two patents

2023, the Court consolidated the new lawsuit with the 
two
 suits we previously filed against Lupin.  No trial date has been set in the consolidated case against Lupin.
In February 2023, we received notice from Teva that it had filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Xywav.  The notice from Teva included a paragraph IV certification with respect to 
thirteen
 of our patents listed in FDA’s Orange Book for Xywav on the date of the receipt of the notice.  The asserted patents relate generally to the composition and method of use of Xywav, and methods of treatment when Xywav is administered concomitantly with certain other medications.  
In March 2023, we filed a patent infringement suit against Teva in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The complaint alleges that by filing its ANDA, Teva has infringed 
thirteen
 of our Orange Book listed patents.  We are seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Teva from introducing a generic version of Xywav that would infringe our patents.  As a result of this lawsuit, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 
30
 months will be imposed by FDA on Teva’s ANDA.  On May

23,

2023, Teva filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid or not enforceable, and that its product, if approved, will not infringe our patents. 
On December 15, 2023, based on a stipulation between all parties, the Court consolidated the Lupin lawsuits and the Teva lawsuit for all purposes.  No trial date has been set in the consolidated case.
In July 2024, we received notices from Lupin and Teva that they had each filed a paragraph IV certification regarding a newly-issued patent listed in the Orange Book for Xywav.  On August 27, 2024, we filed an additional lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of Lupin and Teva, alleging that, by filing its ANDA, each party infringed the newly-issued patent related to a method of treatment using Xywav.  The suits seek orders that the effective date of FDA approval of each defendant’s application shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the newly-issued patent.
Epidiolex Patent Litigation
In November and December 2022, we received notices from the Epidiolex ANDA Filers, that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) oral solution.  As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of other ANDA filers.  The notices from the Epidiolex ANDA Filers each included a “paragraph IV certification” with respect to certain of our patents listed in FDA’s Orange Book for Epidiolex on the date of the receipt of the notice.  The listed patents relate generally to the composition and method of use of Epidiolex, and methods of treatment using Epidiolex.  A paragraph IV certification is a certification by a generic applicant that alleges that patents covering the branded product are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic product.
On January

3,

2023, we filed a patent infringement suit against the Epidiolex ANDA Filers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The complaint alleges that by filing their ANDAs, the Epidiolex ANDA Filers have infringed certain of our Orange Book listed patents, and seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDAs shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the last to expire of the asserted patents.  As a result of this lawsuit, we expect that a stay of approval of up to 
30
 months will be imposed by FDA on the Epidiolex ANDA Filers’ ANDAs.
From March 2023 through May 2023, we received the Epidiolex ANDA Filers’ answers to the complaint.  The answers include defenses and counterclaims asserting that the Epidiolex ANDA Filers’ products, if launched, would not infringe our patents, that our patents are invalid and, in one instance, counterclaims related to allegations of inequitable conduct and improper listing of patents in the Orange Book.  On May 25, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss certain of the counterclaims.  On January 11, 2024, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss.  On 
September 20, 2024, the Court held a claim construction hearing relating to disputed terms in the asserted patents.  
The Court has not yet issued a decision on the claim construction disputes
.

The Court in the Epidiolex Patent Litigation scheduled trial for September 2025.
In June and July 2023, we received notice from certain of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers that they had each filed a paragraph IV certification regarding a newly-issued patent listed in the Orange Book for Epidiolex.  On July

21,

2023, we filed an additional lawsuit against all of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that, by filing its ANDA, each Epidiolex ANDA Filer infringed the newly-issued patent related to a method of treatment using Epidiolex.  The suit seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of each Epidiolex ANDA Filer’s application shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the newly-issued patent.
In September and October 2023, we received notice from certain of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers that they had each filed a paragraph IV certification regarding one or more newly-issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Epidiolex.  On December 15, 2023, we filed an additional lawsuit against 
seven
 of the original Epidiolex ANDA Filers with whom we have not previously settled.

Epidiolex.  The suit seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of each Epidiolex ANDA Filer’s application shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the newly-issued patents.
In March and April 2024, we received notice from certain of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers that they had each filed a paragraph IV certification regarding one or more newly-issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Epidiolex.  On July 3, 2024, we filed an additional lawsuit against 
six
 of the original Epidiolex ANDA Filers with whom we had not previously settled.  We filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that, by filing its ANDA, each Epidiolex ANDA Filer infringed the newly-issued patents related to methods of treatment using Epidiolex.  The suit seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of each Epidiolex ANDA Filer’s application shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the newly-issued patents.
From October 2023 through January 2025, we entered into settlement agreements with each of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers that resolved our patent litigation with them related to Epidiolex.  Under the settlement agreements, we granted each of the Epidiolex ANDA Filers a license to manufacture, market, and sell its own generic version of Epidiolex beginning in the very late 2030s, or earlier under certain circumstances, including but not limited to the launch of another generic Epidiolex product or a final decision that all unexpired claims of the Epidiolex patents are not infringed, or are invalid and/or unenforceable.
Zepzelca Patent Litigation
In July and August 2024, we received notices from the Zepzelca ANDA Filers that they have each filed with FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Zepzelca (lurbinectedin).  As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of other ANDA filers.  The notices from the Zepzelca ANDA Filers each included a paragraph IV certification with respect to a patent listed in the Orange Book for Zepzelca on the date of the receipt of the notice.  The listed patent relates to the drug substance, drug product and approved use of Zepzelca.  Jazz is the exclusive licensee to this Zepzelca patent pursuant to an agreement with PharmaMar.  A paragraph IV certification is a certification by a generic applicant that alleges that the patent covering the branded product is invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic product.
On September 11, 2024, we and PharmaMar filed a patent infringement suit against the Zepzelca ANDA Filers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The complaint alleges that by filing their ANDAs, the Zepzelca ANDA Filers have infringed the Orange Book listed patent for Zepzelca, and seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDAs shall be a date no earlier than the expiration of the asserted patent.  
In December 2024, we received the Zepzelca ANDA Filers’ answers to the complaint.  The answers include defenses and counterclaims asserting that the Zepzelca ANDA Filers’ products, if launched, would not infringe our patents and that our patents are invalid.  No trial date has been set in this matter.
On September 12, 2024, we and PharmaMar filed a patent infringement suit against RK Pharma, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The complaint alleges that by filing its ANDA, RK Pharma has infringed the Orange Book listed patent for Zepzelca, and seeks an order that the effective date of FDA approval of RK Pharma’s ANDA shall be no earlier than the expiration of the asserted patent.  On November 13, 2024, we voluntarily dismissed this action against RK Pharma in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  RK Pharma remains a defendant in the litigation referenced above in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
MSP Litigation
On April

3,

2023, MSP filed a class action lawsuit on behalf itself and others similarly situated against
 the Defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

The MSP complaint alleges that the Defendants conspired to increase the price and quantity dispensed of Xyrem and Prialt, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and several state laws.

The allegations relate generally to the conduct at issue in the investigation conducted by the United States Department of Justice from 2016-2019, involving the Company’s contributions to certain charitable foundations.  
MSP seeks monetary damages, restitution, disgorgement, and a declaration that the conduct alleged is unlawful.  
On July

25,

2023, we and certain other defendants filed motions to dismiss MSP's complaint, which the Court granted on December 12, 2023.  On January 5, 2024, the MSP filed an amended complaint.  On February 20, 2024, we filed a motion to dismiss MSP’s amended complaint.  The Court scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024.  On June 21, 2024, the Court cancelled the hearing.  On July 22, 2024, the Court granted the motion.  The Court set a deadline of August 12, 2024, to file a second amended complaint.  On August 12, 2024, MSP voluntarily dismissed its complaint.
FDA Litigation
On June

22,

2023, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaration that FDA’s approval on May 1, 2023, of the NDA for Avadel's Lumryz was unlawful.  In the complaint, we alleged that FDA acted outside its authority under the Orphan Drug Act, when, despite ODE protecting Jazz’s low-sodium oxybate 
F-37
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
product Xywav, FDA approved the Lumryz NDA and granted Lumryz ODE based on FDA’s finding that Lumryz makes a major contribution to patient care and is therefore clinically superior to Xywav and Xyrem.  Jazz further alleged that, in doing so, FDA failed to follow its own regulations, failed to follow established agency policy without providing a reasoned explanation for the departure, reversed prior decisions by its own staff and experts without a reasoned explanation, and disregarded the relevant scientific literature and data.  The complaint, filed pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, asked the Court to vacate and set aside FDA’s approval of the Lumryz NDA and sought a declaration that FDA’s approval of the Lumryz NDA was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law and that approval of the Lumryz NDA was in excess of FDA’s statutory authority and was made without observance of procedure required by law.
On September

15,

2023, we filed a motion for summary judgment.  On October

20,

2023, Avadel and FDA filed cross motions for summary judgment.  Oral argument on these motions was held on May 10, 2024 and on October 30, 2024, the District Court issued an order denying Jazz’s motion for summary judgment and granting Avadel’s and FDA’s cross-motions for summary judgment.  Jazz respectfully disagrees with the Court’s decision and is appealing the matter to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  We filed our opening appeal brief on January 31, 2025.  No argument date has been set.
Qui tam matter
In July 2022, we received a subpoena from the USAO for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to Xyrem and U.S. Patent No. 8,772,306 (“Method of Administration of Gamma Hydroxybutyrate with Monocarboxylate Transporters”), product labeling changes for Xyrem, communications with FDA and the USPTO, pricing of Xyrem, and other related documents.  On July 18, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam whistleblower lawsuit underlying the USAO’s subpoena, captioned 1:21-cv-10891-PBS and originally filed under seal on May 27, 2021.  The public docket in this matter indicates that on May 24 and June 7, 2024, respectively, the United States and a number of states named in the whistleblower complaint declined to intervene in this matter.  As such, private whistleblower litigation will proceed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The Court set a deadline of September 1, 2024, for the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, and December 2, 2024, for us to file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
  The p
laintiff filed the amended complaint on September 1, 2024.
  We filed our motion to dismiss on December 2, 2024.  The Court scheduled a hearing on the motion to dismiss for April 2, 2025.
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  We believe there is no other litigation pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Shareholders’ Equity 
Share Repurchase Program
In July 2024, our board of directors authorized the New Repurchase Program, to repurchase ordinary shares having an aggregate purchase price of $
500.0
 million, exclusive of any brokerage commissions.  Under the New Repurchase Program, which has no expiration date, we may repurchase ordinary shares from time to time by any methods and/or structures permitted by applicable law.  The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of our ordinary shares, alternative investment opportunities, restrictions under the Amended Credit Agreement and the indenture for our Secured Notes, corporate and regulatory requirements and market conditions.  The New Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without our prior notice.  The New Repurchase Program replaces and supersedes the Old Repurchase Program, a share repurchase program to repurchase ordinary shares having an aggregate purchase price of $
1.5
 billion, exclusive of any brokerage commissions.  In 2024, we spent a total of $
150.0
 million to repurchase 
1.4
 million of our ordinary shares, all under the New Repurchase Program, at a purchase price, including commissions, of $
109.32
 per share and $
161.4
 million to repurchase 
1.5
 million of our ordinary shares, all under the Old Repurchase Program, at a purchase price, including commissions, of $
110.75
 per share.  The repurchases made under the New Share Repurchase Program in 2024 were effected in privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the 2030 Notes concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the 2030 Notes.  In 2023, we spent a total of $
269.8
 million to purchase 
2.1
 million of our ordinary shares under the Old Repurchase Program at an average total purchase price, including commissions, of $
126.65
 per share.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  As of December 31, 2024, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases under the New Repurchase Program was $
350.0
 million, exclusive of any brokerage commissions.

Dividends
In 2024 and 2023, we did 
not
 declare or pay cash dividends on our common equity.  Under Irish law, dividends may only be paid, and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded only out of, “distributable reserves.”  In addition, the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions by us in respect of our ordinary shares, subject to, among other exceptions, (1) a general exception for dividends and other restricted payments not to exceed in the aggregate the greater of $
350
 million and 
3.5
% of consolidated total assets (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) when made, and (2) an exception that allows for dividends and other restricted payments equal to an amount tied to our financial performance, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement and the total net leverage ratio (as defined in in the Amended Credit Agreement) on a pro forma basis does not exceed 
5
:1, and (3) an exception that allows for additional dividends and other restricted payments, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement and the total net total leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) on a pro forma basis is not greater than 
4
:1.  Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will, subject to Irish legal requirements, be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement or other future borrowing arrangements, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.

Potentially dilutive ordinary shares from our employee equity incentive and purchase plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs and PRSUs, the assumed exercise of share options and the assumed issuance of ordinary shares under our ESPP.
On January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” on a modified retrospective basis, which requires the use of the if-converted method to calculate potentially dilutive ordinary shares for convertible instruments.
In August 2023, we made an irrevocable election to fix the settlement method for exchanges of the 2024 Notes to a combination of cash and ordinary shares of the Company with a specified cash amount per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes of $
1,000
.  As a result of the election, an exchanging holder will receive (i) up to $
1,000
 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes exchanged and (ii) cash, ordinary shares, or any combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of $
1,000
 per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes exchanged.  As a result, the assumed issuance of ordinary shares upon exchange of the 2024 Notes has only been included in the calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share in 2023 up to the date the irrevocable election was made.
In July 2024, we irrevocably elected to fix the settlement method for exchanges of the 2026 Notes to a combination of cash and ordinary shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc with a specified cash amount per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged equal to or in excess of $
1,000
.  As a result of the election, an exchanging holder will receive (i) up to $
1,000
 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged and (ii) cash, ordinary shares, or any combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of $
1,000
 per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes exchanged.  As a result, the assumed issuance of ordinary shares upon exchange of the 2026 Notes has only been included in the calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share in 2024, up to the date the irrevocable election was made.
The potential issue of ordinary shares upon exchange of the 2026 Notes and the 2024 Notes was anti-dilutive and had no impact on diluted net loss per ordinary share for 2022.
For the 2030 Notes, we are required to settle the principal amount in cash and have the option to settle the conversion feature for the amount above the conversion price, or the conversion spread, in cash, ordinary shares or a combination of cash and ordinary shares.  The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per ordinary share when the average market price of our ordinary shares for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the 2030 Notes.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the 2030 Notes have been excluded from the computation of diluted net income per ordinary share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive since the conversion price of the 2030 Notes exceeded the average market price of our ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Share-Based Compensation
GW Incentive Plans
On May 5, 2021, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc acquired the entire issued share capital of GW.  In connection with the GW Acquisition, we assumed the GW Incentive Plans.  The terms of the GW Incentive Plans provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, other stock awards, and performance awards that may be settled in cash, shares, or other

property.  Ordinary shares granted to employees in exchange for GW ADS, in connection with the GW Acquisition, vest ratably over service periods of 
two years
, while all post-acquisition grants vest ratably over service periods of 
four years
 and expire no more than 
10
 years after the date of grant.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
1,864,475
 of our ordinary shares had been authorized for issuance under the GW Incentive Plans.
2011 Equity Incentive Plan
In connection with the Azur Merger, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s board of directors adopted the 2011 Plan in October 2011, and its stockholders approved the 2011 Plan at the special meeting of the stockholders held in December 2011.  The 2011 Plan became effective immediately before the consummation of the Azur Merger and was assumed and adopted by us upon the consummation of the Azur Merger.  The terms of the 2011 Plan provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, other stock awards, and performance awards that may be settled in cash, shares, or other property.  All outstanding grants under the 2011 Plan were granted to employees and vest ratably over service periods of 
four years
 and expire no more than 
10
 years after the date of grant.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
34,836,988
 of our ordinary shares had been authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan.
2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2007, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s employees became eligible to participate in the ESPP.  The ESPP was amended and restated by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s board of directors in October 2011 and approved by its stockholders in December 2011.  The amended and restated ESPP became effective immediately prior to the effective time of the Azur Merger and was assumed by us upon the consummation of the Azur Merger.  The amended and restated ESPP allows our eligible employee participants (including employees of any parent or subsidiary company if our board of directors designates such company as eligible to participate) to purchase our ordinary shares at a discount of 
15
% through payroll deductions.  The ESPP consists of a fixed offering period of 
24
 months with 
four
 purchase periods within each offering period.  The number of shares available for issuance under our ESPP during any six-month purchase period is 
175,000
 shares.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
7,029,250
 of our ordinary shares had been authorized for issuance under the ESPP.
Amended and Restated 2007 Non-Employee Directors Stock Award Plan
The Amended and Restated 2007 Directors Award Plan, which was initially adopted by the Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. board of directors and approved by the Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stockholders in connection with its initial public offering, was continued and assumed by us upon the consummation of the Azur Merger.  Until October 2011, the 2007 Directors Award Plan provided for the automatic grant of stock options to purchase shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s common stock to its non-employee directors initially at the time any individual first became a non-employee director, which vest over 
three years
, and then annually over their period of service on its board of directors, which vest over 
one year
.  On October 24, 2011, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s board of directors amended the 2007 Directors Award Plan to eliminate all future initial and annual automatic grants so that future automatic grants would not be made that would be subject to the excise tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code in connection with the Azur Merger.  Accordingly, all future stock option grants under the 2007 Directors Award Plan will be at the discretion of our board of directors.  Since the Azur Merger, all of the new grants under the 2007 Directors Award Plan were granted to non-employee directors and vest ratably over service periods of 
one
 to 
three years
 and expire no more than 
10
 years after the date of grant.  In August 2016, our shareholders approved our proposal to expand the types of stock awards that may be granted to our non-employee directors under the 2007 Directors Award Plan and eliminate the final automatic share reserve increase under the 2007 Directors Award Plan that was scheduled to occur on January 1, 2017.  In July 2020, our shareholders approved our proposal to increase the number of ordinary shares authorized for issuance under the 2007 Directors Award Plan by 
500,000
 shares.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
1,403,938
 of our ordinary shares had been authorized for issuance under the 2007 Directors Award Plan.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
The Compensation & Management Development Committee of our board of directors and, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, the independent members of our board of directors, approved awards of PRSUs to certain employees of the Company, subject to vesting on the achievement of certain commercial and pipeline performance criteria to be assessed over a performance period from the date of the grant to December 31, 2024, December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026, respectively.  The number of shares that vest is determined based on the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria.  For PRSUs granted prior to 2024, the amount of shares that vest will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a relative TSR modifier.  For PRSUs granted in 2024, the relative TSR represents one of the performance metrics.  In both cases, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between 
0
% and 
200
% of the target number of PRSUs granted.

 million and $

 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to tax arising on income or losses in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, offset by deductions on subsidiary equity, patent box benefits, foreign derived intangible income benefits and originating tax credits.  Our income tax benefit in 2024 decreased compared to 2023 primarily due to the change in income mix across jurisdictions, partially offset by patent box benefits.  Our income tax benefit in 2023 decreased compared to 2022 primarily due to pretax losses from payments for acquired IPR&D made in 2022 and the 2022 impairment of our acquired IPR&D asset as a result of the decision to discontinue our nabiximols program, partially offset by the change in income mix across jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2024, we had NOL and tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of 
$
11.0
 million
 and $
20.5
 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes.  The U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in the tax years 2025 to 2033 and the U.S. federal tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in the tax years 2027 to 2044.  In addition, we had $
4.9
 million of NOL carryforwards and $
5.8
 million of tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 available to reduce future taxable income for U.S. state income tax purposes.  The U.S. state NOL carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in the tax years 2025 to 2034.  As of December 31, 2024, there were NOL and other carryforwards for income tax purposes of  $
1,125.6
 million, $
790.3
 million and $
374.8
 million available to reduce future income subject to income taxes in Malta, the United Kingdom and Ireland respectively.  The NOLs and other carryforwards generated in Malta, the United Kingdom and Ireland have no expiration date.  We also had foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland, as of December 31, 2024, of $
100.9
 million, which may only be utilized against certain sources of income.  The foreign tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date.
Utilization of certain of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions.  Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain NOLs and tax credits before future utilization.  In addition, as a result of the Azur Merger, until 2022 we were subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code in relation to the utilization of U.S. NOLs to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions.
Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable.  Such assessment is required by tax-paying component.  Our valuation allowance was $
509.2
 million and $
312.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for certain Irish, U.S. (federal and state) and foreign deferred tax assets which we maintain until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal.  As part of the overall change in valuation allowance, we recognized a net income tax expense of $
202.0
 million, $
76.2
 million and $
95.1
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating primarily to the creation of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets primarily associated with  carryforwards in foreign subsidiaries and foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland.  We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, future projections of taxable income, tax legislation, rulings by relevant taxing authorities, the progress of tax examinations and the regulatory approval of products currently under development.  Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income.  The Company believes that it is more likely than not to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets carried as of December 31, 2024 for which no valuation allowance has been recognized.
No provision has been made for income tax on undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operations.  Temporary differences related to such earnings totaled $
1.6
 billion as of December 31, 2024.  In the event of the distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends, a sale of the subsidiaries, or certain other transactions, we may be liable for income taxes, subject to an adjustment, if any, for foreign tax credits.  The Company estimates that it would incur additional income taxes of up to $
81.0
 million on repatriation of these unremitted earnings to Ireland.
We only recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.  As a result, we have recorded an unrecognized tax benefit for certain tax positions which we judge may not be sustained upon examination.

The unrecognized tax benefits were included in income taxes payable, other non-current liabilities and deferred tax assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.  Interest related to income taxes is recorded in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income (loss).  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our accrued interest related to income taxes was $
8.6
 million and $
8.4
 million, respectively.  Interest related to income taxes recognized in the consolidated statements of income (loss) were not significant.  Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were potential benefits of $
86.8
 million and $
77.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income.  The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $
26.7
 million of its currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2025 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.
We file income tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions, the most significant of which are Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S. (both at the federal level and in various state jurisdictions).  For Ireland we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for the years prior to 2020.  For the U.K. we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for the years prior to 2016.  The U.S. jurisdictions generally have statute of limitations three to four years from the later of the return due date or the date when the return was filed.  However, in the U.S. (at the federal level and in most states), carryforwards that were generated in 2020 and earlier may still be adjusted upon examination by the taxing authorities.  Certain of our Luxembourg subsidiaries are currently under examination by the Luxembourg taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.  In October 2022 and January 2023, we received tax assessment notices from the Luxembourg taxing authorities for all open tax years relating to certain transfer pricing and other adjustments.  The notices propose additional Luxembourg income tax of approximately $
23.3
 million, translated at the foreign exchange rate as at December 31, 2024.  We disagree with the proposed assessments and are contesting them vigorously.
The Government of Ireland, the jurisdiction in which Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc is incorporated, transposed the Global Minimum Tax Pillar Two rules into domestic legislation as part of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 (the "Finance Act").  The Finance Act closely follows the EU Minimum Tax Directive and certain OECD Guidance released to date.  The Company is within the scope of these rules, which took effect from January 1, 2024.  Under the new legislation, we are liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the Pillar Two effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate.  The rules on how to calculate the Pillar Two effective tax rate are detailed and highly complex and specific adjustments envisaged in the Pillar Two legislation can give rise to different effective tax rates compared to those calculated for accounting purposes.  We account for Pillar Two top-up taxes as a current tax when they are incurred.  We do not believe we were subject to the top-up tax in 2024.  The proportion of our profit before tax which is subject to the top-up tax and our exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes in future years will depend on factors such as future revenues, costs and foreign currency exchange rates.  We will continue to monitor changes in law and guidance in relation to Pillar Two.
