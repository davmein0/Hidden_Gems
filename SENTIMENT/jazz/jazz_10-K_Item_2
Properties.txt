On October 11, 2024, a new lease agreement was entered into for premises located at 3000 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, California, with an area of 27,000 square feet, with occupancy expected by July 1, 2025.  The lease expires in 2035.
We believe that our existing properties are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.  As we continue to expand our operations, we may need to lease additional or alternative facilities.
