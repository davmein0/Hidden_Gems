Market Information for Common Stock
Our common stock has been traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “UPWK” since October 3, 2018. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. 
Holders of Record
As of January 31, 2025, there were approximately 1,300 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our common stock represented by these record holders.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the development of our business, for repurchases under our 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization, and for general corporate purposes, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
The information required by this item will be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Overview

Business
Independent talent is an increasingly sought-after, critical, and expanding segment of the global workforce. We operate the world’s largest work marketplace that connects businesses with independent talent from across the globe, as measured by GSV. GSV represents the total amount that clients spend on our offerings as well as additional fees we charge to talent and clients for other services. Talent includes independent professionals and agencies of varying sizes. Clients on our work marketplace range in size from independent professionals and small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. With customers in over 180 countries, our work marketplace enabled $4.0 billion of GSV for the year ended December 31, 2024.
As a global work marketplace that connects talent and clients regardless of their location, our GSV originates from around the world. In 2024, our work marketplace enabled $4.0 billion in GSV, with approximately 25% generated from U.S. talent, making the United States our largest talent geography in each of 2024, 2023, and 2022. India and the Philippines were our next largest talent geographies in all three years. Of the $4.1 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in both 2023 and 2022, approximately 26% was generated from talent in the United States in each year.
Approximately 70% of our GSV in 2024 was generated from U.S. clients, compared to approximately 69% and 68% of GSV in 2023 and 2022, respectively, with clients in no other country representing more than 10% of our GSV in any such year.
We generate revenue from both talent and clients of our Marketplace and Enterprise offerings. Revenue is primarily generated from talent service fees and, to a lesser extent, client marketplace fees. We also generate revenue through ads and monetization products, including purchases of Connects, talent memberships, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we earn interest on funds held on behalf of customers.
The Company operates its business as one operating and reportable segment. For additional information, see “Note 15—Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Financial Highlights for 2024
Over the past several quarters, we implemented a number of initiatives that positively impacted Marketplace revenue and Marketplace take rate. These include (i) retiring the tiered service fee structure for talent working with clients on our Marketplace offering in favor of a flat fee, (ii) increasing the number of Connects needed by talent to bid on projects, (iii) deploying ads products on our work marketplace, and (iv) introducing new features, with a focus on generative artificial intelligence.
These initiatives contributed to an increase to Marketplace revenue of $76.0 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023. Marketplace take rate also benefited from these initiatives, increasing to 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 15.4% in 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated net income of $215.6 million, compared to net income of $46.9 million in 2023. This included a non-cash tax benefit of $140.3 million from the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $167.6 million in 2024, from $73.1 million in 2023. This improvement was primarily due to strong operational discipline, proactive cost management, and higher margin revenue growth.
We expect the initiatives implemented over the past several quarters, along with operational efficiencies and cost savings from the Restructuring Plan, will continue to positively impact net income and adjusted EBITDA in 2025. 
37
Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP. See “Key Financial and Operational Metrics—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a definition of adjusted EBITDA and for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure prepared under U.S. GAAP.
Recent Developments
Restructuring Plan
In October 2024, we announced the Restructuring Plan, intended to continue our profitable trajectory, increase efficiency, and accelerate innovation for our customers. The Restructuring Plan included a reduction of our total workforce by approximately 21% and resulted in $19.2 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits for the Company’s impacted workforce. For additional information, see “Note 17—Restructuring Charges” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Acquisition of Objective AI, Inc
.
In November 2024, we completed the acquisition of Objective AI, acquiring 100% of Objective AI's outstanding equity for total cash consideration of $19.1 million. This strategic acquisition aims to enhance our platform by integrating advanced AI-native search capabilities and strengthen our AI and search teams with specialized talent. For additional information, see “Note 7—Business Combination” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We believe these key financial and operational metrics are useful to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of our business and in understanding our operating results, and management uses these metrics to track our performance. We expect our key metrics may fluctuate between periods due to a number of factors, including changing macroeconomic conditions; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) in any given period; the lapping of significant launches of new products, pricing changes, and other monetization efforts; and ongoing efforts to improve processes on our work marketplace, including project proposals and purchases of Connects, among others. For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our key financial and operational metrics, see “Risk Factors—We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.”
38
Gross Services Volume (GSV)
GSV represents the amount of business transacted through our work marketplace. The primary component of GSV is client spend, which we define as the total amount that clients spend on our offerings. GSV also includes fees charged to talent and clients, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, purchases of Connects, talent memberships, and foreign currency exchange. 
For purposes of determining countries where we enable GSV, we include both the countries in which the clients that paid for the applicable services are located, as well as the countries in which talent that provided those services are located.
Growth in the number of active clients and GSV per active client are the primary drivers of GSV. 
Marketplace Revenue
Marketplace revenue is the primary driver of our business, and we believe it provides comparability to other online marketplaces. Marketplace revenue represents the majority of our revenue and is derived from our Marketplace offerings, which include all offerings other than our Enterprise offerings—Enterprise Solutions and Managed Services. We generate Marketplace revenue from both talent and clients. Marketplace revenue is primarily generated from talent service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount talent charges clients for services accessed on our Marketplace, and to a lesser extent, client marketplace fees. We also generate revenue through ads and monetization products, including purchases of Connects, talent memberships, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we earn interest on funds held on behalf of customers. 
Marketplace Take Rate
Marketplace take rate measures the correlation between Marketplace revenue and Marketplace GSV and is calculated by dividing Marketplace revenue by Marketplace GSV. We define Marketplace GSV as GSV derived from our Marketplace offerings. Marketplace take rate is an important metric because it is the key indicator of how well we monetize spend on our work marketplace from our Marketplace offerings.
Active Clients and GSV per Active Client
We define an active client as a client that has had spend activity on our work marketplace during the 12 months preceding the date of measurement. GSV per active client is calculated by dividing total GSV during the four quarters ended on the date of measurement by the number of active clients on the date of measurement. We believe that the number of active clients and GSV per active client are indicators of the growth and overall health of our business. The number of active clients is a primary driver of GSV and, in turn, Marketplace revenue.
While continued use of our work marketplace by talent is a factor that impacts our ability to attract and retain clients, we currently have a significant surplus of talent in relation to the number of clients actively engaging talent for most categories of services on our work marketplace. As a result of this surplus, we primarily focus our efforts on retaining client spend and acquiring new clients, as opposed to acquiring new talent and retaining existing talent. Moreover, we generate revenue when clients engage and pay talent, and therefore, our key metrics and operating results are directly impacted by client spend. Additionally, the number of talent retained between periods is merely one of many factors that may impact client spend in a particular period and is not a primary driver of our key metrics and operating results.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Marketplace Revenue.
 Marketplace revenue is primarily generated from talent service fees, and to a lesser extent, client marketplace fees. We maintain a flat talent service fee of 10% for talent working with clients on our Marketplace offerings. Revenue for a majority of our talent service fees is recognized on the Sunday of each week, as this is the day we have the contractual right to bill talent for the service fees. We charge a client marketplace fee of 5% on each transaction—or 3% if paid via ACH for eligible clients.
We also generate revenue through ads and monetization products, including purchases of Connects, talent memberships, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we earn interest on funds held on behalf of customers. 
Enterprise Revenue. 
Enterprise offers two lines of service—Enterprise Solutions and Managed Services. 
39
Our Enterprise Solutions offering includes access to additional product features, premium access to top talent, professional services, custom reporting, and flexible payment terms. Revenue from our Enterprise Solutions offering includes all client fees, subscriptions, and talent service fees. For our Enterprise Solutions offering, we charge clients a monthly or annual subscription fee and a service fee calculated as a percentage of the client’s spend on talent services, in addition to a 10% service fee paid by talent. Additionally, clients of our Enterprise Solutions offering can also subscribe to a compliance service that includes worker classification services for an additional fee and may also choose to use our work marketplace to engage talent that were not originally sourced through our work marketplace for a lower fee percentage.
Through our Managed Services offering, we are responsible for providing services and engaging talent directly or as employees of third-party staffing providers to perform services for clients on our behalf. The talent providing services in connection with our Managed Services offering include independent talent and agencies of varying sizes. Under U.S. GAAP, we are deemed to be the principal in these Managed Services arrangements and therefore recognize the entire GSV of Managed Services projects as Managed Services revenue, as compared to recognizing only the percentage of the client spend that we receive, as we do with our Marketplace and Enterprise Solutions offerings.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin
Cost of Revenue.
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our Managed Services offering, personnel-related costs for our services and support personnel, third-party hosting fees for our use of AWS, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. We define personnel-related costs as salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and entertainment, and stock-based compensation costs for employees and the costs related to other service providers we engage.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin.
 Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may be influenced by our revenue, the mix of payment methods that our clients choose, the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, our continued investments in our services and support teams, the timing and amounts paid to talent in connection with our Managed Services offering, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. In addition, gross margin will be impacted by fluctuations in our revenue mix between Marketplace revenue and Enterprise revenue.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development.
 Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software and platform development that qualifies for capitalization.
Sales and Marketing.
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of expenses related to advertising and marketing activities, as well as personnel-related costs, including sales commissions, which we expense as they are incurred.
General and Administrative.
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and operations functions; outside consulting, legal, and accounting services; and insurance. 
Provision for Transaction Losses.
 Provision for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from fraud and bad debt expense associated with our trade and client receivables balance and transaction losses associated with chargebacks. Provisions for these items represent estimates of losses based on our actual historical incurred losses and other factors.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income that we earn from our operating investments, namely our deposits in money market funds and investments in marketable securities, interest expense on our outstanding borrowings, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision)
We account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method, which involves recognizing deferred assets and liabilities for expected future tax effects of differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.
40
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in the relevant authoritative guidance. To the extent that we believe any amounts are less likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets.
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the relevant guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return, and also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluation of uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. A liability is reported for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, macroeconomic conditions adversely impacted GSV, which declined 3%, compared to 2023. The number of active clients decreased 2% as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, driven by slower growth in acquisition of new clients. As a result, GSV per active client decreased 1% as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. We expect no material improvement to macroeconomic conditions in 2025.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, total revenue was $769.3 million, representing an increase of $80.2 million, or 12%, compared to 2023. 
Marketplace revenue increased by $76.0 million, or 13%, compared to 2023, largely due to a number of initiatives that we implemented over the past several quarters, including modifying existing offerings and other services and features. Specifically, we retired the tiered service fee structure for talent working with clients on our Marketplace offering—ranging from 5% to 20%—in favor of a flat fee of 10%, increased the number of Connects needed by talent to bid on projects, deployed ads products on our work marketplace, and introduced a contract initiation fee for clients on our Marketplace offering. These factors also drove Marketplace revenue to grow at a faster rate than Marketplace GSV, which caused Marketplace take rate to increase to 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 15.4% in 2023.
We expect Marketplace revenue to decrease in 2025 compared to 2024 reflecting the impact of broader macroeconomic conditions.
Enterprise revenue represented 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and increased by $4.2 million, or 4%, compared to 2023, due to increased revenue from our Managed Services offerings, driven by new spend from existing clients.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, cost of revenue increased by $3.6 million, or 2%, compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in the cost of talent services to deliver Managed Services revenue of $5.0 million and amortization expense related to internal-use software and platform development costs of $4.1 million, offset by a reduction in payment processing fees of $2.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross margin increased to 77%, compared to 75% in 2023, primarily driven by the increase in Marketplace revenue.
We expect cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in future periods, reflecting the expected decrease in revenue on our work marketplace. Amounts paid to talent in connection with our Managed Services offering are tied to the volume of managed services used by our clients. The level and timing of these items could fluctuate and affect our cost of revenue in the future. We expect gross margin to remain consistent in 2025 compared to 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, research and development expense increased by $31.9 million, or 18%, compared to 2023. This increase was primarily driven by $8.2 million in costs related to the Restructuring Plan, $8.0 million in personnel-related costs and intangible amortization from our asset acquisition in November 2023, and $11.1 million in other personnel-related costs. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2024, costs related to software increased $1.5 million compared to 2023. 
While we remain committed to ongoing innovation to further enhance our platform, including building new features with a focus on generative artificial intelligence, we expect total research and development expense to decrease in 2025.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, sales and marketing expense decreased by $35.5 million, or 16%, compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by cost-saving measures implemented in the second quarter of 2023 and extended throughout 2024, including reduced investments in brand marketing and vendor spend. As a result, marketing and advertising expense decreased by $28.6 million compared to 2023. Additionally, personnel-related costs decreased $12.1 million, compared to 2023. These savings were partially offset by $7.1 million in costs incurred as a result of the Restructuring Plan.
As a result of our reduced investment in brand marketing, the reduction of our workforce, and other cost-saving measures implemented in the past several quarters, we expect sales and marketing expense to decrease in 2025, compared to 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, general and administrative expense increased by $9.9 million, or 8%, compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of $5.5 million. Additionally, we incurred a $2.6 million increase in legal and consulting fees associated with corporate initiatives and other matters, and $1.1 million in early lease termination fees recognized during the period.
As a result of cost savings measures implemented in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect general and administrative expense to decrease in 2025, compared to 2024.

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a $125.2 million income tax benefit and a $2.0 million income tax expense, respectively. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to income tax expense in 2023, resulted primarily from the release of the $140.3 million valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. This release was based on an evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, including our recent history of taxable income and expectations of future taxable earnings. As a result of this assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful in evaluating our operating performance.
We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; other income (expense), net, which includes interest expense; income tax benefit (provision); and, if applicable, certain other gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are non-cash or are significant and the result of isolated events or transactions that have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. Additionally, in response to the war in Ukraine, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred certain incremental expenses associated with our humanitarian response efforts. These expenses are not representative of our ongoing operations, and, as a result, we excluded these costs from adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of $38.9 million on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Other income, net” in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). See “Note 10—Debt” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes.
(2)
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $140.3 million from the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by approximately $15.0 million of tax expense. See “Note 14—Income Taxes” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
(3)
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $19.2 million in costs related to the execution of the Restructuring Plan. Of this amount, $18.4 million is included in Other, while the remaining amount is allocated between “Stock-based compensation expense” and “Other income, net”. See “Note 17—Restructuring Charges” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
(4)
During each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred $0.8 million of expense related to the warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share issued to the Tides Foundation in 2018.
(5)
During the year ended December 31, 2022, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we incurred certain incremental expenses associated with our humanitarian response efforts. These expenses are not representative of our ongoing operations, and, as a result, we excluded these costs from adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022. These expenses consisted of (i) $1.4 million of special one-time bonuses to our team members in the region impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, (ii) $1.5 million of expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our team members in the impacted region, (iii) $1.1 million of donations made to humanitarian aid organizations to support initiatives related to humanitarian response efforts in the impacted region, primarily to Direct Relief International, a humanitarian aid organization, and (iv) $0.4 million of payments of one-time service award bonuses (and associated taxes) to certain of our team members paid in recognition of contributions made by such team members to our humanitarian response efforts in the impacted region.
We use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:
•
adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; other income (expense), net, which includes interest expense; income tax benefit (provision); and, if applicable, certain other gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are non-cash or are significant and the result of isolated events or transactions that have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future, all of which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;
•
our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a 
45
measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and
•
adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.
Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:
•
adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
•
although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (b) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (c) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and
•
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.
Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with net income (loss) and our other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury bills, corporate bonds, U.S. and foreign government securities, asset-backed securities, and other types of fixed income securities. The primary objective of our investment activities from our operating investments is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Since our inception, our business has consisted of the operation of an online work marketplace that connects businesses with independent talent from across the globe, and we do not make investments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $305.8 million and $79.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $316.3 million and $470.5 million in marketable securities, respectively.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. In the long term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the cost to host our work marketplace, the introduction of new offerings and services, the continuing market adoption of our work marketplace, any acquisitions or investments that we make in complementary businesses, products, and technologies, macroeconomic conditions, any repurchases of shares of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding Notes, and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing.
To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, cash from marketable securities, and cash from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) are insufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, or should we require additional cash for other purposes, we will need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements, as we did with the offering of the Notes. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership and economic interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we will be subject to additional debt service requirements and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could also be unfavorable to our equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms we deem acceptable, 
46
or at all. The inability to raise additional capital as and when required would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to achieve our business objectives.
Commitments and Contingencies
Our principal commitments consist of the Notes, future purchase commitments for cloud infrastructure and other services, and obligations under our non-cancellable operating leases for office space. Assuming the outstanding Notes are not converted into our common stock, repurchased, or redeemed prior to maturity, (i) annual interest expense relating to the Notes will be $2.7 million in each fiscal year through 2025 and $1.8 million in 2026 and (ii) principal in the amount of $361.0 million will be payable upon the maturity of the Notes on August 15, 2026. For additional information about our Notes, see the section below titled “—Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026.” 
In July 2024, we commenced a non-cancellable agreement for cloud infrastructure and other services that contains future purchase commitments of $40.0 million over two years, with $20.0 million in each year. As of December 31, 2024, we had remaining purchase commitments under this agreement of $30.0 million.
As of December 31, 2024, our future lease commitments were $15.9 million (excluding adjustments for discount to present value), including $1.9 million for 2025. 
During the periods presented, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources.
Share Repurchase Program
In November 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of shares of our outstanding common stock under the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 8.1 million shares of common stock under the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization for an aggregate amount of $100.0 million at an average price of $12.38 per share, including fees associated with the repurchases and excluding excise tax. As of December 31, 2024, we had no remaining balance available for repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization.
In October 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of shares of our outstanding common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization. As of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million available for repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization. As was the case with the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization, repurchases of our common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization may be made from time to time on the open market (including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act), in privately negotiated transactions, or by other methods, at our discretion, and in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization has no expiration date and will continue until otherwise suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason. The 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on market and business conditions.
Escrow Funding Requirements
As a licensed internet escrow agent, we offer escrow services to customers of our work marketplace and, as such, we are required to hold our customers’ escrowed cash and in-transit cash in trust as an asset and record a corresponding liability for escrow funds held on behalf of talent and clients on our balance sheet. We expect the balances of our funds held in escrow, including funds held in transit, and the related liability to fluctuate based on marketplace activity and may vary from period to period. Escrow regulations require us to cover the trust with our operating cash in the event of shortages due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings. Talent submit their billings for hourly contracts to their clients on a weekly basis every Sunday, and the aggregate amount of such billings is added to escrow funds payable to talent on the same day. As of each Sunday of each week, we have not yet collected funds for hourly billings from clients as these funds are in transit. Therefore, in order to satisfy escrow funding requirements, every Sunday we match the shortage of cash in trust by restricting our own operating cash and typically collect this cash shortage from clients within the next several days. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, were $195.7 million and $212.4 million, respectively. We deposit a portion of funds held in escrow in interest-bearing checking accounts. 
47
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 and Capped Calls
As of December 31, 2024, $361.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding.
The Notes were issued in August 2021, pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of an indenture between us and Computershare Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears, and are due August 15, 2026. Upon conversion, we have an option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. 
As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase outstanding Notes, as we did in the three months ended March 31, 2023, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer, by exchange transaction, or otherwise. Such repurchases of Notes, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time.
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which we refer to as the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.
The initial cap price of the Capped Calls is $92.74 per share of common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. See “Note 10—Debt” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes and the Capped Calls.

Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash from operating activities is revenue generated from our work marketplace. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our Managed Services offering, and third-party hosting costs. 
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2024 was $153.6 million, which resulted from net income of $215.6 million and non-cash charges of $47.0 million, offset by net cash outflows of $15.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2023 was $52.7 million, which resulted from net income of $46.9 million and non-cash charges of $45.1 million, offset by net cash outflows of $39.2 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2022 was $11.5 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $112.2 million, offset by a net loss of $89.9 million and net cash outflows of $10.8 million from changes in operating 
48
assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables. 
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities during 2024 was $137.6 million, which was primarily a result of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $486.9 million and $41.8 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by investing $362.3 million in various marketable securities, $14.3 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Objective AI, $10.9 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period, and $3.5 million paid for purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash provided by investing activities during 2023 was $88.3 million, which was primarily a result of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $648.8 million and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $165.0 million, including $143.7 million to enable the repurchase of a portion of the Notes, partially offset by investing $709.2 million in various marketable securities, as well as $12.7 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period, and $3.0 million for the purchase of an intangible asset.
Net cash used in investing activities during 2022 was $69.5 million, which was primarily a result of investing $581.9 million in various marketable securities, as well as $7.5 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $1.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $521.2 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities during 2024 was $82.0 million, which was driven by $100.0 million cash paid for repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization, partially offset by an increase in escrow funds payable of $10.0 million, proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $4.8 million, and cash received from stock option exercises of $3.3 million.
Net cash used in financing activities during 2023 was $139.8 million, which was driven by $171.3 million that we paid to consummate the repurchase of a portion of the Notes, including related fees to effect the repurchases, partially offset by an increase in escrow funds payable of $25.4 million, proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $4.1 million, and cash received from stock option exercises of $2.0 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities during 2022 was $1.1 million, which was primarily a result of proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $3.8 million, cash received from stock option exercises of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in escrow funds payable of $4.3 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. 
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from talent and clients from our Marketplace and Enterprise offerings. We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services.
Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires management to make judgments and estimates. Judgments include determining whether to present revenue gross, as a principal, or net, as an agent, which is based on an evaluation of whether we control the service prior to it being transferred to the client. 
We recognize deferred revenue as the related performance obligations are satisfied, on a ratable basis over the relevant service period. Management applies judgement in assessing the continued appropriateness for the estimates, which include assessing the continued appropriateness of the methodology and relevant data inputs to estimate the likelihood and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. We utilize historical customer transaction data in developing these estimates. We recognize revenue related to the material rights based on our estimate of when the material rights are exercised, and adjust revenue for changes in estimates in the period of change on a cumulative catch-up basis.
49
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee service providers, including stock options, restricted stock units, which we refer to as RSUs, performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and purchase rights granted under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the 2018 ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the estimated fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rates, and the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards.
The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined using the closing common stock price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of PSUs that are probable of being earned as of the grant date. We use the quoted market price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the fair value of RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and purchase rights under our 2018 ESPP. 
We generally recognize the fair value of stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the period during which a service provider is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period and account for forfeitures as they occur. 
Stock-based compensation expense associated with service and market-based stock options is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the service condition and market condition. 
Stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the performance condition or the service condition, if applicable.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under current tax law. 
A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance involves significant judgment and requires consideration of various factors, including historical levels of pre-tax income or loss adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, the timing and magnitude of future reversals of existing temporary differences, and projections of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is reduced or removed when, based on a comprehensive evaluation of all available evidence, it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Key factors in determining the removal of a valuation allowance include sustained profitability, changes in business operations that increase taxable income, or significant new sources of taxable income, such as new contracts or operational expansions.
We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
Borrowings under the Notes have a fixed interest rate. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $361.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the Notes, respectively. 
50
Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities from our operating investments is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not make investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our portfolio’s fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes.
We also earn interest on funds held on behalf of customers that we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as funds held in escrow, including funds in transit. Because these balances are highly liquid, their fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes.
We do not believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition to the U.S. dollar, we offer clients the option to settle invoices denominated in the U.S. dollar in the following currencies: Euro, British Pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, South African rand, New Zealand dollar, Polish zloty, Swiss franc, Norwegian krone, Danish krone, Swedish krona, Turkish lira, Japanese yen, and Hong Kong dollar. When clients make payments in one of these currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk during the period between when payment is made and when the payment amounts settle. To mitigate this risk, we may enter into forward contracts or secure foreign currency exchange rates for certain durations with financial institutions. As such, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to our operating results have been immaterial to date.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Upwork Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Upwork Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
53
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Talent Service Fee and Client Marketplace Fee
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company earns fees from talent and clients under its marketplace offerings, which represent a single promise to provide continuous access to the Company’s work marketplace and site services. The Company’s single promise is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company allocates consideration to each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill. The Company’s marketplace offerings may include fixed and variable consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated revenue was $769.3 million, of which a majority relates to talent service fee and client marketplace fee revenue. 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for talent service fee and client marketplace fee revenue is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for talent service fee and client marketplace fee revenue. These procedures also included, among others, testing revenue recognized for a sample of talent service fee and client marketplace fee revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, terms of service, invoices, payment receipts, and client acceptance of the milestones.

UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1—
Organization and Description of Business
Upwork Inc., which is referred to as the Company or Upwork, operates a work marketplace that connects businesses, which are referred to as clients, with independent talent. Independent talent on the Company’s work marketplace, which are referred to as talent, and, together with clients, as customers, include independent professionals and agencies of varying sizes and are an increasingly sought-after, critical, and expanding segment of the global workforce. The Company is incorporated in the state of Delaware and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.
Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Upwork” and the “Company” in these notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to Upwork and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Note 2—
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which is referred to as U.S. GAAP, and include the accounts of Upwork Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Prior period presentation has been revised to conform to the current period presentation as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Presentation
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company elected to change the presentation of certain cash flows on its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The change in Trade and Client Receivables relating to amounts received on behalf of talent to fund their escrow accounts was reclassified from operating activities to financing activities, reflected within the caption Change in escrow fund payable, net. Prior period comparative amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. This change had the impact of increasing cash flow provided by operating activities by $
25.5
 million and $
4.9
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a corresponding offset in cash provided by (used in) financing activities. This reclassification did not affect the previously reported total cash balances on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additionally, these reclassifications had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operation and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, or Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Such estimates include, but are not limited to: the useful lives of assets; assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets; goodwill impairment; standalone selling price of material rights and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights; allowance for expected credit losses; liabilities relating to transaction losses; stock-based compensation; and accounting for income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company evaluates its estimates, assumptions, and judgments on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and revises them when facts and circumstances dictate.
The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents to include cash held in checking and interest-bearing accounts and investments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, and debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.

4.1
 million and $
4.4

0.6
 million and $
0.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company maintains its customers’ funds held in escrow in demand or interest-bearing checking accounts at U.S. financial institutions, as well as 
two
 California licensed money transmitters. The balance in these accounts was in excess of federally insured limits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Customers’ funds held in escrow are denominated exclusively in U.S. dollars.
The Company is an internet escrow agent and is therefore required to hold its customers’ escrowed funds and escrow funds in-transit in trust as an asset and record a corresponding liability for escrow funds payable on its consolidated balance sheets. For this reason, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, are restricted cash. Escrow funds in-transit arise due to the time it takes to clear transactions through external payment networks. When clients fund their escrow account using credit cards, there is a clearing period before the cash is received and settled. Accordingly, the funds are treated as escrow funds in transit until the transaction

is settled to the escrow trust bank account or, in the case of international credit card settlements, to the Company’s bank accounts. Escrow regulations require the Company to fund the trust with its own operating cash if there is ever a shortage due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $
195.7
 million and $
212.4
 million, respectively, as funds held in escrow, including funds in transit.
The below table reconciles cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Marketable Securities
The Company’s marketable securities consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury bills, corporate bonds, U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and other types of fixed income securities issued by foreign governments or entities and denominated in U.S. dollars, which have contractual maturities within 36 months from the date of purchase. The marketable securities are available for current operations and are classified as available-for-sale. These marketable securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included within the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. 
The Company periodically assesses its portfolio of debt investments for impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessment first takes into account the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income, net. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company assesses whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers factors such as the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through other income, net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any additional impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive

income (loss). Changes in the allowance for credit losses are reflected as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell are met. These changes are recorded in other income, net. The Company determines realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and records such gains or losses in other income, net within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Escrow Funds Payable
Escrow funds payable represent customer funds that are held in escrow by the Company on behalf of both talent and clients. Escrow funds payable to talent are comprised primarily of funds available to be withdrawn by talent for work performed and paid by clients. Escrow funds payable to clients primarily represent deposits received from certain clients to set up an account or to apply toward future payments to talent upon completion of the project defined and agreed between the client and talent.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentration of risk consist primarily of cash, restricted cash, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, and trade and client receivables. The Company maintains its cash balances with large, high-credit quality financial institutions and other payment companies. At times, such deposits may be in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits. Credit risk on trade receivables is limited as a result of the large size of the Company’s client base as well as a large portion of payments made using pre-authorized credit cards. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. For any receivables that are deemed not collectible, losses are recorded when probable and estimable. These losses, when incurred, have been within the range of the Company’s expectations.
The Company had two clients that accounted for more than 
10
% of trade and client receivables as of December 31, 2024. The Company did not have any clients that accounted for more than 10% of trade and client receivables as of December 31, 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any clients that accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. 
The Company is dependent upon third parties, such as Amazon Web Services, in order to meet the uptime and performance needs of its customers.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, marketable securities, trade and client receivables, prepaid and other current assets, escrow funds payable, and debt.
The Company believes that the carrying values of financial instruments approximate their fair values.

Trade and Client Receivables and Related Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
Trade and client receivables are primarily comprised of amounts receivable from clients for completed work, including amounts in transit. It also includes unbilled amounts due from clients primarily through the Company’s Managed Services offering. Trade and client receivables are recorded and stated at realizable value, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. Credit is extended generally without collateral to the Company’s clients of its Enterprise offerings based on an initial and ongoing evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. In aggregate, gross trade receivables were $
28.5
 million and $
30.0
 million and gross client receivables were $
51.6
 million and $
78.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The allowance for expected credit losses is the Company’s estimate of the probable credit losses on accounts receivable. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of the accounts and determines the allowance recognized by taking into consideration the aging of its receivable balances, historical write-off experience, probability of collection, and other relevant data. Trade and client receivables are written off against the allowance when management determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable.

Derivative Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, as well as certain foreign currency denominated expenses, hedging the gains or losses generated by the re-measurement of significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes and these instruments generally have maturities within 12 months.
The foreign currency forward contracts were recorded at fair value and, when in gain positions, were reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets. When in loss positions, the foreign currency forward contracts were recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were recorded in other income, net to offset the changes in the fair value of the underlying assets or liabilities that were being hedged.
The notional amounts associated with the Company’s foreign exchange activity as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
0.2
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively, none of which were designated as cash flow hedges. The carrying values of the foreign currency forward contracts approximated their fair values due to their relatively short settlement durations. The fair values of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material. 
Gains on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were $
0.1
 million and $
0.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were $
0.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Leases
The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is referred to as the FASB, Accounting Standards Update, which is referred to as ASU, No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which the Company adopted on December 31, 2019 effective as of January 1, 2019 using the effective date method.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally

two
 to 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful lives. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Internal-Use Software and Platform Development Costs
The Company’s policy is to capitalize certain costs to develop its internal-use software and platform when (i) preliminary project planning is completed, (ii) the Company has committed project resourcing, and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional significant functionality are also capitalized. Such costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives determined on a project-by-project basis, which historically has ranged between 
two
 to 
five years
, beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Amortization of capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs is allocated to functional expense categories based on headcount and the nature and intended use of the project.

Segment Information
The Company has 
one
 operating and reportable segment. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is referred to as the CODM, is its President and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
Business Combination and Goodwill
The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. 
The Company determines the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by exercising judgment and using various estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, cash flow projections, discount rates, and comparable company analyses. To support this process, the Company may engage a third-party valuation firm, as needed, to assist in determining the fair values of acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and any contingent consideration in a business combination.
Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based on a single reporting unit structure by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. For 2024, the Company conducted its goodwill impairment testing by performing step one of the quantitative assessment, of the two-step impairment model. The Company determined the fair value by using quoted market prices of the Company’s common stock. The Company determined that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, and, as such, the Company concluded that there was 
no
 impairment of goodwill at the impairment testing date. There has been 
no
 impairment of goodwill for any of the periods presented.

Acquired Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets
The Company’s intangible assets include identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed technology, acquired as part of a business combination in November 2024, as well as an assembled workforce, acquired as part of an asset acquisition in November 2023. These intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, either based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, or using the straight-line method when the pattern cannot be reliably determined. The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from 
six months
 to 
three years
. Intangible amortization expense related to developed technology and an assembled workforce is included in research and development expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Intangible amortization expense related to customer relationships is included in sales and marketing expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-lived tangible and amortizable intangible assets. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life, on a prospective basis.
The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and internal-use software and platform development costs. 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If it is determined that the asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There has been 
no
 asset impairments for any of the periods presented.

Convertible Senior Notes
The Company accounts for the 
0.25
% convertible senior notes due 2026, which are referred to as the Notes, as a single liability measured at amortized cost. The carrying value of the liability equals the proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes less debt issuance costs. In March 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with a limited number of institutional holders of the Notes to repurchase for cash an aggregate of $
214.0
 million principal amount of the Notes for an aggregate cash payment of $
170.8
 million, which are collectively referred to as the Note Repurchases. See “Note 10—Debt” for additional information.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue from talent and clients from its Marketplace and Enterprise offerings. The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(Topic 606), which the Company adopted on December 31, 2019 effective as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes payments to customers when those customers provide services in their capacity as vendors. These payments are for distinct services and are at fair value. These transactions are primarily with certain financial institutions that the Company uses as payment processors on the work marketplace. The Company accounts for the consideration payable to these customers in their capacity as vendors as a purchase of services from a vendor and records such payments in either cost of revenue or sales and marketing within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
Marketplace Offerings
The Company’s Marketplace revenue represents the majority of its revenue and is derived from its Marketplace offerings, which include all offerings other than the Enterprise offerings—Enterprise Solutions and Managed Services. The Company generates Marketplace revenue from both talent and clients. Marketplace revenue is primarily generated from talent service fees, and to a lesser extent, client marketplace fees. 
The Company also generates Marketplace revenue through ads and monetization products, including purchases of Connects, which are virtual tokens required for talent to bid on projects and purchase ads products on the Company’s work marketplace, membership fees, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, Additionally the Company earns interest on funds held on behalf of customers.
The Company earns fees from talent under its Marketplace offerings and associated premium offerings, which represent a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., stand-ready performance obligation) to the Company’s work marketplace and site services. As each day of providing access to the work marketplace and site services (including, but not limited to, communication, invoicing, reporting, dispute resolution, and payment services) is substantially the same and talent simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as access is provided, the Company’s single promise is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company allocates consideration to each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill. The Company’s talent arrangements may include fixed and variable consideration, or a combination of the two, comprised of the following: 
Service fees. 
Talent are provided access to the Company’s work marketplace to market their businesses, send proposals to and communicate with prospective clients, and, if engaged by a client, to perform specified services agreed between talent and clients, which are referred to as talent services. Talent charge clients on an hourly or a milestone basis for services rendered to clients through the Company’s work marketplace, which are referred to as talent billings. Prior to May 2023, the Company charged talent a service fee as a percentage of talent billings primarily using a tiered service fee model based on cumulative lifetime billings by talent to each client. In May 2023, the Company retired the tiered service fee structure for talent working with clients on its Marketplace offering— ranging from 
5
% to 
20
%—in favor of a simplified flat service fee of 
10
%. This change took effect on new contracts and existing contracts that would have otherwise been subject to a 
20
% fee under the tiered service fee model. Talent that had existing contracts with a 
5
% fee under the tiered service fee model retained that rate for those contracts through the end of 2023. Prior to this change, talent service fee arrangements subject to tiered service fees also included contract renewal options that represented a material right. The Company takes no responsibility for talent services, and therefore, does not control talent services. Additionally, talent and clients negotiate and agree upon the scope and the price for talent services directly with each other, and the Company is not a party to those agreements. Accordingly, for these arrangements, the 
64
UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
Company presents revenue on a net basis, as an agent. The Company recognizes the service fees for each distinct service period when it has the contractual right to bill for the services. 
Withdrawal fees
. The Company charges withdrawal fees to talent when talent withdraw their escrow funds held by the Company. A withdrawal fee is charged for each withdrawal transaction, which represents variable consideration. The Company presents revenue from withdrawal fees on a gross basis as a principal and not net of the third-party payment processing costs incurred because the Company controls the payment processing services prior to providing to the Company’s talent. The Company recognizes the withdrawal fees when transactions are processed, which is when it has the contractual right to bill for the services.
Membership fees.
 The Company charges membership fees to talent. These fees are fixed consideration and are charged monthly. The Company recognizes the revenue over the period of the membership, which is generally monthly, consistent with the common measure of progress for the entire performance obligation.
The Company charges fees to talent for the purchase of Connects. Connects represent a separate performance obligation. Connects fees represent fixed consideration and are allocated to and recognized in the distinct service period in which the Connects are used by talent.
Certain of the Company’s contracts with talent contain multiple performance obligations in the event the Company determines a material right exists. Specifically, prior to the shift to a simplified flat service fee in May 2023, the arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees included contract renewal options that represent a material right. For such arrangements, the Company allocated revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price by applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under Topic 606. Standalone selling prices for offerings subject to tiered service fees were estimated based on observable transactions when these services were sold on a standalone basis. Standalone selling price for a material right was estimated by determining the discount that talent would obtain when exercising the option, adjusted for the likelihood that the option will be exercised. Significant judgment was applied in the application of the portfolio approach practical expedient, which included estimating the standalone selling price of the material rights and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. Specifically, management applied significant judgment in assessing the appropriateness of the model for the estimates, which included assessing the appropriateness of the methodology and relevant data inputs to (i) estimate the standalone selling price of the material rights, which included the standalone selling price of the services when sold separately and the likelihood of exercise of the material rights; and (ii) estimate the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. The Company utilized historical customer transaction data in developing the estimates. The Company recognized revenue related to the material rights based on the Company’s estimate of when the material rights were exercised and adjusted revenue for changes in estimates in the period of change on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The Company earns fees from clients under the Marketplace offerings, which represents a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., stand-ready performance obligation) to the Company’s work marketplace and site services. As each day of providing access to the work marketplace and site services is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, the Company’s single promise under its Marketplace offering is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company’s Marketplace offerings may include fixed and variable consideration, or a combination of the two, comprised of the following:
Client marketplace fees.
 The Company charges a client marketplace fee on a per-transaction basis and is considered variable consideration. Client marketplace fees are assessed on both fixed price and hourly contracts. The Company allocates client marketplace fees to each distinct service period based on the contractual right to bill. For fixed price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue when a client funds a contract, and for hourly contracts, the Company recognizes revenue at the end of the weekly billing period, which is when the Company has the contractual right to bill for the services. For client marketplace fees, the Company presents revenue on a gross basis as a principal and not net of the third-party payment processing costs incurred because the Company controls the services prior to providing to the Company’s clients.
Contract initiation fees.
 The Company charges a contract initiation fee on new contracts between talent and clients, which is considered fixed consideration. The contract initiation fee is assessed on both fixed price and hourly contracts. The Company allocates the contract initiation fee to each distinct service period based on the contractual right to bill. For fixed price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue when a client initially funds a contract, and for hourly contracts, the Company recognizes revenue at the first weekly billing period, which is when the Company has the contractual right to bill for the services. For contract initiation fees, the Company presents revenue on a gross basis as a principal and not net of the third-party payment processing costs incurred because the Company controls the services prior to providing to the Company’s clients.

Foreign currency exchange fees.
 The Company charges clients a fixed mark-up above foreign currency exchange rates that are charged to the Company when the Company collects amounts denominated in foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange fees are variable consideration and recognized as they are earned for each transaction processed, which is when the Company has the contractual right to bill for the services.
Upwork Payroll service fees.
 The Company charges clients using the Upwork Payroll offering when their talent are classified as employees for engagements on the Company’s work marketplace. The client enters into an Upwork Payroll agreement with the Company, and Upwork separately contracts with unrelated third-party staffing providers that provide employment services to such clients. In such arrangements, talent providing talent services to clients become employees of third-party staffing providers. In arrangements where clients enter into Upwork Payroll agreements, the Company charges Upwork Payroll service fees to clients and does not charge service fees to talent who are employees of the third-party staffing providers. Such service fees are variable consideration and charged as a fixed percentage of the total talent billings. Under an Upwork Payroll agreement, the Company provides the client access to the Upwork work marketplace to procure and manage talent services, as well as access to employment services provided by the third-party staffing providers. The Company presents Upwork Payroll service fees revenue on a net basis as an agent of the client for providing access to employment services provided by the third-party staffing providers. The Company does not control these employment services performed by the third-party on behalf of the client or for the services performed by talent that are employed by the third-party staffing providers. Therefore, the Company is not considered the principal for these services. The Company recognizes the service fees for each distinct service period when it has the contractual right to bill for the services.
Certain of the Company’s Marketplace offerings include revenue sharing arrangements under which the Company generates a revenue share as a percentage of the fees charged by certain financial institutions to talent for payment withdrawals. These arrangements are considered a single performance obligation comprised of variable consideration and are recognized over time based on transactions processed.
The Company earns interest on a portion of customer funds while they are held in escrow. The interest is considered variable consideration and is recognized when it is specified and earned from the financial institution.
Enterprise Offerings
The Company earns fees from talent under its Enterprise Solutions offering, which represents a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., stand-ready performance obligation) to the Company’s work marketplace and site services. As each day of providing access to the work marketplace and site services is substantially the same and talent simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as access is provided, the Company’s single promise under its Enterprise Solutions offering is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company allocates variable consideration to each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill. These arrangements include variable consideration as follows:
Service fees.
 The Company provides talent access to the Upwork marketplace to perform talent services for clients. The Company charges talent a service fee as a percentage of talent billings. For service fees charged to talent, the Company presents revenue on a net basis, as an agent, for providing access to the Upwork marketplace as it does not control talent services provided to clients, and therefore the Company is not considered the principal for talent services. Additionally, talent and clients negotiate and agree upon the scope and the price for talent services directly with each other, and the Company is not a party to their agreement. The Company recognizes the service fees for each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill for the services. 
The Company earns fees from clients under its Enterprise Solutions and other premium offerings, each of which represent a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., stand-ready performance obligation) to the Company’s work marketplace and site services. As each day of providing access to the work marketplace and site services is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, the Company’s single promise under its Enterprise Solutions and other premium offerings is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. The Company allocates variable consideration to each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill. These arrangements may include fixed and variable consideration, or a combination of the two, comprised of the following:
Client service fees.
 The Company offers clients access to the Company’s work marketplace to source talent in exchange for a client service fee calculated as a percentage of talent billings; these fees represent variable consideration. The Company recognizes the service fees for each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill for the services.

UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
Enterprise compliance service fees. 
The Company charges fees to clients of its Enterprise Compliance offering who engage the Company to provide services to determine whether talent should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor based on the scope of talent services agreed between the client and talent and other factors. The Company charges Enterprise Compliance service fees as a percentage of talent billings; these fees represent variable consideration. The Company recognizes the service fees for each distinct service period in which it has the contractual right to bill for the services.
Subscription fees.
 The Company charges monthly or annual subscription fees to clients for subscription services. These subscription fees are fixed consideration and are recognized over the period of the subscription consistent with the common measure of progress for the entire performance obligation.
Upwork Payroll service fees.
 Upwork Payroll service fees are recognized on the same basis as described under the Marketplace offering and are variable consideration.
Under a Managed Services arrangement, the Company is responsible for providing services and engaging talent directly or as employees of third-party staffing providers to perform the services for clients on the Company’s behalf. These arrangements are generally time- and materials-based, and are invoiced on a monthly basis. These fees represent variable consideration. The Company controls and directs the services performed on behalf of talent and presents revenue on a gross basis as principal. As each day of providing Managed Services is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as services are provided, the Company’s single promise under its Managed Services offering is comprised of a series of distinct service periods. For Managed Services arrangements with clients, the Company allocates the variable amounts to each distinct service period within the series in which it has the contractual right to bill and recognizes revenue as each distinct service period is performed.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue consists of subscription, membership, and Connects fees collected in advance of performing the service or the talent using the Connect. Deferred revenue also consists of amounts attributable to unexercised material rights related to arrangements with talent that were subject to tiered service fees. In May 2023, the Company retired its tiered service fee structure for talent and introduced a simplified flat service fee. With this change, the Company no longer allocates a portion of the transaction price to unexercised material rights.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our Managed Services offering, personnel-related costs for the Company’s services and support personnel, third-party hosting fees, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. The Company defines personnel-related costs as salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and entertainment, and stock-based compensation costs for employees, and costs related to other service providers the Company engages to provide internal services to the Company.
Research and Development
Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software and platform development that qualify for capitalization.
Advertising Expense
Advertising costs are expensed as they are incurred, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
 The Company incurred $
57.1
 million, $
83.2
 million, and $
121.2
 million in advertising expenses during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from fraud and bad debt expense associated with our trade and client receivable balance and transaction losses associated with chargebacks. Provision for these items represent estimates of losses based on the Company’s actual historical incurred losses and other factors.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock options with service and market-based conditions, restricted stock units, which are referred to as RSUs, performance stock units, which are referred to as PSUs, and purchase rights granted under 
67
UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is referred to as the 2018 ESPP, to employees and directors based on their estimated fair value on the date of grant. The fair value and derived service period of stock options with market-based conditions is estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The Company evaluates the assumptions used to value option awards upon each grant of stock options. The fair value of RSUs awarded to employees is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined using the Company’s closing common stock price on the grant date multiplied by the number of PSUs that are probable of being earned as of the grant date. The fair value of purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The model requires the Company to make a number of assumptions, including the value of the Company’s common stock, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. 
Stock-based compensation expense associated with service- and market-based stock options will be recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the service condition and market condition. The Company generally recognizes stock-based compensation expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. 
Stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the performance condition and the service condition, if applicable. Stock-based compensation for purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP is recognized over the offering period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency of the country in which the foreign subsidiary is located. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
 The Company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of $
0.1
 million and $
0.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net foreign currency transaction losses of $
0.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in the relevant authoritative guidance. To the extent that the Company believes any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. 
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the relevant guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company’s income tax return, and also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluation of uncertain tax positions. Step one, Recognition, requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. Step two, Measurement, is based on the largest amount of benefit, which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. A liability is reported for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.
Net Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) is computed by adjusting net income (loss) to

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, including outstanding common stock options, RSUs, PSUs, warrants to purchase common stock, common stock issuable in connection with the 2018 ESPP, and common stock issuable in connection with the Notes. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
: 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which is referred to as ASU 2023-07
. 
ASU 2023-07 requires public entities to disclose information about their significant expenses and other items by reportable segment on both an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply these enhanced disclosure requirements as well as all existing segment and reconciliation requirements under Accounting Standards Codification, which is referred to as ASC, 280 for both interim and annual reporting.
On December 31, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-07, effective as of January 1, 2024. As a result, the Company has updated its segment disclosures in “Note 15 – Segment Information,” providing more detailed information on significant expenses and other relevant segment items in accordance with the new guidance.
The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not result in any changes to the Company’s reportable segments but did enhance the granularity of disclosures within our financial statements, increasing transparency for interim and annual reporting periods.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
With the exception of those discussed below, the Company has reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded they were either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
which is referred to as ASU 2023-09
. 
ASU 2023-09 requires public entities to provide annual disclosures of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and to disclose income taxes paid, disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which is referred to as ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 requires public entities to disclose detailed information about specific types of expenses included within the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. While ASU 2024-03 does not alter the presentation of expense captions on the face of the income statement, it introduces requirements for disaggregating certain expense captions into specified categories within the footnotes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.

Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligation
Deferred revenue represents amounts billed in advance for services not yet rendered.
Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as current deferred revenue, while the remaining balance is noncurrent.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s performance obligation from transaction price that has been allocated to unexercised material rights related to the Company’s arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees was immaterial and is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.
The Company has applied the practical expedients and exemptions and does not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less; and (ii) contracts for which the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation under the series guidance.

During 2024, changes in the contract liabilities balances were primarily the result of normal business activity, including the deferral, and subsequent recognition, of revenue related to arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees and related allocation of transaction price to material rights. The significant change in deferred revenue in 2024 compared to the prior year was largely attributable to the Company’s transition away from the tiered service

Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $

Note 4—
Fair Value Measurements
The Company defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level I—Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
•
Level II—Observable inputs other than Level I prices, such as unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
•
Level III—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value and require significant management judgment or estimation.
The categorization of a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments that are carried at fair value consist of Level I and Level II assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The following tables summarize the Company’s available-for-sale marketable securities’ amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair value by significant investment category reported as cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Leases
Operating Leases
The Company leases office space and certain equipment under various operating leases, with the vast majority of its lease portfolio consisting of operating leases for office space. The Company has also entered into arrangements where it acts as a sublessor in its leases of office space. The Company has not entered into any significant finance, sales-type, or direct financing leases. 
The Company’s significant judgments include determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability, and whether or not lease incentives are reasonably certain to occur in the initial measurement of the lease liability. Operating lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
A contract is or contains an embedded lease if the contract meets all of the below criteria:
•
there is an identified asset;
•
the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of the asset; and
•
the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
For initial measurement of the present value of lease payments and for subsequent measurement of lease modifications, the Company is required to use the rate implicit in the lease. Since the majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is a collateralized rate. The application of the incremental borrowing rate is performed on a lease-by-lease basis and approximates the rate at which the Company could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to its lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
four years
 to 
eight years
. The Company includes lease payments associated with renewal options in its operating lease asset and liability only when it becomes reasonably certain the company will exercise the renewal option. The Company has not included renewal options for any of its operating leases in its determination of lease liabilities. The Company does not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale leaseback terms, or material restrictive covenants. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Palo Alto Office Lease
In June 2024, the Company entered into a new lease agreement to lease approximately 
12,685
 square feet of office space in Palo Alto, California, which serves as the Company’s corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in September 2024 and rent payments for the premises will commence in March 2025. The initial term of the lease is 
91
 months from the commencement date and is set to expire in September 2032, unless terminated earlier. The Company has 
two
 options to extend the lease term, each for an additional 
three years
, exercisable under certain conditions as specified in the lease agreement. The Company evaluated these options as part of the lease accounting under ASC 842 and determined that the extension options are not reasonably certain to be exercised. As such, the options have not been included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset or lease liability. As a result of entering into this lease, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of $
4.5
 million and $
4.4
 million, respectively. Rent payments under this lease are approximately $
0.1
 million per month and are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The lease for the Company’s previous headquarters in San Francisco, California expired in August 2024. 
Santa Clara Sub-Sublease
In November 2023, the Company amended its sub-sublease agreement, originally executed in April 2021, to sublease the entirety of its former headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The amended sub-sublease extends the term by an additional 
51
 months, through August 31, 2028, unless terminated earlier. The amended sub-sublease term aligns substantially with the remaining term of the Company’s master lease. Rent payments under the amended agreement approximate $
0.1
 million per month and are recorded within general and administrative expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Neither party has the option to renew or extend the sub-sublease agreement. 
Under the amended sub-sublease agreement, the Company is not relieved of its original obligation with the master lessor, which expires on October 15, 2028. The Company determined that the sublease agreement constitutes an operating lease, consistent with the classification of the original sublease agreement with the landlord.
Chicago Leases
In December 2024, as a result of the restructuring plan announced in October 2024, which the Company refers to as the Restructuring Plan, the Company entered into an early termination agreement for the Chicago leases, effective December 31, 2024. The Company recognized approximately $
1.1
 million in early termination costs, primarily consisting of remaining lease payments under the termination agreement. Operating lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2024, including variable lease charges, reflect amounts incurred prior to the lease termination.

UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
Prior to the termination, the Company leased office space in Chicago, Illinois, consisting of the 11th and 16th floors of an office building, with both leases originally scheduled to expire on April 30, 2025. Monthly rent payments for each floor were approximately $
0.1
 million.

Business Combination
On November 20, 2024, the Company acquired Objective AI Inc., referred to as Objective AI, a search-as-a-service platform specializing in AI-native search integration for digital experiences. The Company acquired 
100
% of Objective AI’s outstanding equity for $
19.1
 million in cash consideration. This strategic acquisition aims to enhance the Company’s platform by integrating advanced AI-native search capabilities and strengthen its AI and search teams with specialized talent.
The acquisition of Objective AI was accounted for as a business combination under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. 
Accordingly, the total purchase consideration was allocated as follows (in thousands):

The excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized from the acquisition is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce associated with Objective AI, that cannot be individually identified and separately recognized as intangible asset. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The Company engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets acquired. All key estimates, assumptions, and forecasts, were either provided by, or reviewed by management. While the third-party specialist provided significant input into the valuation, the final conclusions reflect the judgment of management. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets were based primarily on significant unobservable inputs and this represents a Level 3 measurement.
The estimated useful lives and fair value of the identifiable intangible assets at acquisition date were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit
In conjunction with the Company’s operating lease agreements, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $
0.6
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively. The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash in the same amount. 
No
 amounts had been drawn against these letters of credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Contingencies
The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. Potential contingencies may include various claims and litigation or non-income tax matters that arise from time to time in the normal course of business. Due to uncertainties inherent in such contingencies, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters, which could subject the Company to significant liability or damages. Any claims, litigation, or other contingencies could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in or following the period that claims, litigation or other contingencies are resolved.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was not a party to any material legal proceedings or claims, nor is the Company aware of any pending or threatened litigation or claims, including non-income tax matters, that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Accordingly, the amounts accrued for contingencies for which the Company believes a loss is probable were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Indemnification
The Company has indemnification agreements with its officers, directors, and certain key employees to indemnify them while they are serving in good faith in their respective positions. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which it agrees to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to clients, business partners, vendors, and other parties, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements, claims related to potential data or information security breaches, intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties, and other liabilities relating to or arising from the Company’s products and services or its acts or omissions. In addition, subject to the terms of the applicable agreement, as part of the Company’s Enterprise Solutions and certain other premium offerings, the Company indemnifies clients that subscribe to worker classification services for losses arising from worker misclassification. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.

Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
In August 2021, the Company issued 
0.25
% convertible senior notes due 2026. The Notes were issued pursuant to and are subject to the terms and conditions of an indenture between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee, which is referred to as the Indenture. The Notes were offered and sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
In March 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with a limited number of institutional holders of the Notes to effect the Note Repurchases, resulting in the repurchase of $
214.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes for an aggregate cash payment of $
170.8
 million. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $
38.9
 million, which is net of $
3.7
 million related to the pro-rata write-off of unamortized issuance costs associated with the sale of the Notes in August 2021, and $
0.6
 million of other fees incurred to effect the Note Repurchases. The resulting gain on early extinguishment of debt is included in other income, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
361.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding.
The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 
0.25
% per year. Interest will accrue from August 10, 2021 and is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2022, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased, or converted in accordance with the terms of the Notes. 
Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at the option of the holder (i) on or after May 15, 2026, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, and (ii) prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2026, only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods specified as follows:
•
during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;
•
during the 
five
 consecutive business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period, which is referred to as the Measurement Period, in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day;
•
if the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; and
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture.
Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of the common stock, at the election of the Company. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 15.1338 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
66.08
 per share of the Company’s 
79
UPWORK INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occur or if the Company issues a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes prior to the maturity date, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. 
The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to a partial redemption limitation), at the Company’s option, on or after August 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the Notes periodically.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, until, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
The Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense was $
0.9
 million and amortization of the issuance costs was $
1.8
 million related to the Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense was $
1.0
 million and amortization of the issuance costs was $
2.1
 million related to the Notes. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the outstanding principal amount. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total estimated fair value of the Notes was $
333.5
 million and $
307.3
 million, respectively, and was determined based on a market approach using actual bids and offers of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period. The Company considers these assumptions to be Level II inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in “Note 4—Fair Value Measurements.”
Capped Calls
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions, which are referred to as the Capped Calls, with various financial institutions.
Subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the Capped Calls cover the number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially underlying the Notes. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the Notes its common stock price per share exceeds the conversion price of the Notes, with such reduction subject to a cap based on the cap price. If, however, the market price per share of common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of common stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls. The initial cap price of the Capped Calls is $
92.74
 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of 
100
% over the last reported sale price of the common stock of $
46.37
 per share on August 5, 2021, the date of issuance of the Notes, and is subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls; provided that the cap price will not be reduced to an amount less than the strike price of $
66.08
 per share.
The Capped Calls are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. The Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification as equity and, as such, are not remeasured each reporting period and are included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders’ equity.

In October 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $
100.0
 million of shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which is referred to as the 2024 Repurchase Authorization. The Company did 
not
 repurchase any shares under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
100.0
 million available for repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization.
As was the case with the 2023 Share Repurchase Authorization, repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization may be made from time to time on the open market (including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act), in privately negotiated transactions, or by other methods, at the Company’s discretion, and in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization has no expiration date and will continue until otherwise suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason. The 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on market and business conditions. 
Common Stock Warrant
In 2018, the Company established The Upwork Foundation initiative. The program includes a donor-advised fund created through the Tides Foundation. In 2018, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 
500,000
 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share to the Tides Foundation, which is referred to as the Tides Foundation Warrant. The vesting and exercisability provisions of the warrant became effective upon the Company’s initial public offering, which is referred to as the IPO, in October 2018. This warrant is exercisable as to 1/10th of the shares on each anniversary of the IPO, with proceeds from the sale of such shares to be donated in accordance with the Company’s directive. 
In 2024, the holder of the warrant exercised 
67,000
 of the then-vested and exercisable shares. In 2023, this warrant was exercised as to all 
50,000
 of the then-vested and exercisable shares. The holder of the warrant did 
no

Equity Incentive Plans
2014 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2014, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders each adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, which is referred to as the 2014 EIP. The total number of shares of common stock reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to such plan was originally 
12,462,985
 plus (i) shares that were then subject to outstanding option grants under the oDesk Corporation 2004 Stock Plan, the Elance 1999 Stock Option Plan, and the Elance 2009 Stock Option Plan, which are referred to collectively as the Prior Plans, but subsequently ceased to be subject to an award for any reason other than exercise of a stock option, (ii) shares that had been reserved but not subject to any outstanding awards under the Prior Plans and (iii) shares issued under the Prior Plans that were repurchased, forfeited, or used to pay employee withholding or exercise price obligations. Under the terms of the 2014 EIP, incentive stock options could be granted at prices not less than 
100
% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant unless determined in writing by the Company’s board of directors. The options granted under the 2014 EIP generally vest over a 
four-year
 period from the original date of grant and expire 
ten years
 from the original grant date. As of 2024, no further awards may be granted under the 2014 EIP.

In 2018, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders each adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, which is referred to as the 2018 EIP, which became effective on the date immediately prior to the date of the IPO. A total of 
10,701,505
 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance pursuant to future awards under the 2018 EIP. On January 1 of each year through 2028, shares available for issuance are increased based on the provisions of the 2018 EIP. Any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2014 EIP that are canceled or repurchased subsequent to the 2018 EIP’s effective date are returned to the pool of shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 EIP. Awards granted under the 2018 EIP may be (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonqualified stock options, (iii) RSUs, (iv) restricted stock awards, or (v) stock appreciation rights, as determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee at the time of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 EIP, the number of shares available for grant was increased by 
6,863,637
 shares in January 2024.
Option Awards
The fair value of options with service- and performance-based conditions is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model as of the grant date using the following assumptions:
Dividend Yield
—The dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
 as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.
Expected Term
—The expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. For awards containing only service conditions, the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method as the Company did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior at the time of grant. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For performance-based awards, the Company uses relevant data, including past exercise patterns, if available, to determine the expected term.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term.
Expected Volatility
—Since the Company did not have a sufficient trading history of its common stock at the time of grant, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company’s industry that the Company considers to be comparable to its business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants.
Fair Value of Common Stock
—Given the absence of a public trading market prior to the IPO, the Company’s board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of its common stock at 
82

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
each grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to: (i) independent contemporaneous third-party valuations of common stock; (ii) the prices for the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock sold to outside investors; (iii) the rights and preferences of redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of its common stock; (v) developments in the business; and (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.

In 2021, the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors approved a stock option grant, which is referred to as the CEO Award, exercisable for up to 
1,500,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock to Hayden Brown, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, under the 2018 EIP. The CEO Award is subject to a service-based vesting requirement, which is referred to as the Service Condition, and a performance-based vesting requirement, which is referred to as the Market Condition. In order for any shares subject to the CEO Award to be exercisable, both the Service Condition and the Market Condition must be satisfied with respect to such shares. The CEO Award vests with respect to the Service Condition in 
sixteen
 equal quarterly installments following the grant date, subject to Ms. Brown’s continuous service to the Company as Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairperson, or any C-level officer position. The CEO Award vests with respect to the Market Condition upon the achievement of certain volume weighted-average common stock price targets measured over any consecutive 
90-day
 period between the grant date and April 18, 2026. 
The 
90-day
 volume weighted-average common stock price targets, and

As of December 31, 2024, none of the Market Condition stock price thresholds had been met, and no shares subject to the CEO Award had been earned or vested.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Award will be recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the Market Condition and the Service Condition. The Market Condition period and the valuation of each tranche of the CEO Award were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. In the event the Market Condition is met prior to the expected achievement period, any then-unrecognized compensation expense associated with the shares that have vested with respect to both the Market Condition and the Service Condition will be recognized immediately in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Award of $
1.3
 million
, 
$
5.1
 million, and $
11.0
 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the CEO Award is recorded as a component of general and administrative expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company estimates the expected term based on a future exercise assumption. The weighted-average derived service period for the CEO Award is 
2.1
 years. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes. The expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatility of the Company over a period equivalent to the expected term of the CEO Award.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $

PSUs.
 In March 2024, the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors, which is referred to as the compensation committee, approved the grant of PSU awards to certain members of the Company’s leadership team under the 2018 EIP, which are referred to as the 2024 PSU Awards. These awards were granted on March 18, 2024, which is referred to as the 2024 PSU Grant Date.
Up to 
fifty
 percent of the total number of shares subject to the 2024 PSU Awards are eligible to vest based on the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance targets in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 and up to the remaining 
fifty
 percent of the total number of shares subject to the 2024 PSU Awards are eligible to vest based on the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance targets in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. For each year, the financial performance targets consist of year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin targets that were established by the compensation committee at the time of grant, which is referred to as the 2024 PSU Performance Condition. In order to receive the vested PSUs, a recipient must remain in continuous service with the Company until the compensation committee certifies the achievement of the 2024 PSU Performance Condition for the applicable year, which is referred to as the 2024 PSU Service Condition. The dates on which such certification takes place are referred to as Certification Dates.
The Company classifies the 2024 PSU Awards as equity awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to the 2024 PSU Awards is a component of operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the 2024 PSU Performance Condition and the 2024 PSU Service Condition, which is 
23
 months and 
35
 months for the shares eligible to vest under the 2024 PSU Awards based on performance in each of the years ending December 31, 2025 and 2026, respectively. The grant date fair value of the 2024 PSU Awards was determined using the Company’s closing common stock price on the 2024 PSU Grant Date multiplied by the number of 2024 PSU Awards that were probable of vesting on the 2024 PSU Grant Date. At each reporting date prior to the Certification Dates, the number of 2024 PSU Awards that are probable of vesting will be reassessed and any changes are reflected in stock-based compensation expense for the period.
In 2023, the compensation committee approved PSU grants to certain members of the Company’s leadership team under the 2018 EIP, which are referred to as the 2023 PSU Awards. These awards were granted on February 18, 2023, which is referred to as the 2023 PSU Grant Date. The number of shares subject to the 2023 PSU Awards that were earned by the recipients, which are referred to as 2023 Earned PSUs, was determined based on the Company’s revenue achievement during the year ended December 31, 2023, which is referred to as the 2023 PSU Performance Condition. Pursuant to the 2023 PSU Performance Condition, the 2023 Earned PSUs are subject to a time-based vesting requirement conditioned on the recipient of the 2023 PSU Award continuing to provide service to the Company for 
four years
 from the 2023 PSU Grant Date, which is referred to as the 2023 PSU Service Condition. The 2023 Earned PSUs will vest with respect to 
25
% of the 2023 Earned PSUs on the 
one-year
 anniversary of the 2023 PSU Grant Date and 1/16th of the 2023 Earned PSUs on a quarterly basis thereafter.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2023 PSU Awards is a component of operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the 2023 PSU Performance Condition and the 2023 PSU Service Condition. The grant date fair value of the 2023 PSU Awards was determined using the Company’s closing common stock price on the 2023 PSU Grant Date multiplied by the number of PSUs that were probable of being earned on the 2023 PSU Grant Date. At each interim reporting date prior to the date on which the compensation committee certified the 2023 PSU Performance Condition, the number of PSUs that were probable of being earned was reassessed and any changes were reflected in the total stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2023 PSU Awards.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the weighted-average grant-date fair value of PSUs granted was $
12.06
, $
11.72
, and $
24.49
, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to PSUs of $
3.1
 million, $
2.4
 million, and $
4.4
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost was $

2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2018, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders each adopted the 2018 ESPP. A total of 
1,700,000
 shares of common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the 2018 ESPP. On January 1 of each year, shares available for issuance are increased based on the provisions of the 2018 ESPP, up to an aggregate maximum of 
20,400,000
 shares issued under the 2018 ESPP, subject to adjustment for certain company capital changes. The 2018 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount of up to 
15
% through payroll deductions of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. Except for the initial offering period, the 2018 ESPP provides for 
24-month
 offering periods beginning November 15 and May 15 of each year, and each offering period consists of 
four

6-month
 purchase periods. Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 ESPP, in January 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance was increased by

In the event the price is lower on the last day of any purchase period, that price is used as the purchase price for that purchase period. 
Additionally, in the event the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of a subsequent offering period is less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the offering date of the current offering period, the offering period resets, and the new lower price becomes the new offering price for a new

The Company has released the valuation allowance of $
140.3
 million as of December 31, 2024. This release reflects the Company’s determination that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result, the income tax benefit for the year was primarily attributable to the release of this valuation allowance. Previously, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance of $
140.3
 million as of December 31, 2023. 
The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment considers all available positive and negative evidence, including cumulative pre-tax income, anticipated future earnings, and the impact of permanent differences and other comprehensive losses. As of December 31, 2024, the Company achieved cumulative U.S. pre-tax income during the prior three years, adjusted for permanent differences and other comprehensive losses, which provided objective and verifiable evidence supporting the release of the valuation allowance. This sustained profitability, combined with anticipated future taxable income, led the Company to conclude, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.
The Company has federal net operating loss, which is referred to as NOL, carryforwards of approximately $
18.9
 million and $
181.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The federal NOL carryforwards of $
18.9
 million generated after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely with utilization in any year limited to 80% of the Company’s taxable income. The Company has California NOL carryforwards of approximately $
91.0
 million and $
81.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. California NOLs will begin to expire in 2032 if not utilized.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued
The Company has federal research and development credits of approximately $
31.1
 million and $
29.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The federal research and development credits will begin to expire in 2038 if not utilized. The Company has California research and development credits of approximately $
16.7
 million and $
16.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. California research and development credits have an infinite carryforward period.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and similar California legislation impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in the event that there is a change in ownership as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue code and similar state provisions. Such a limitation could result in the expiration of the NOL carryforwards and tax credits before utilization, which could result in increased future tax liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
20.0
 million, which would impact the Company’s effective tax rate, if recognized.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not currently recognize any penalties or interest charges relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company does not anticipate the recorded reserves to change significantly in the next 12 months. 
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. Due to certain tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years 2001 to 2023 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company is subject to ongoing audits by state and foreign tax authorities.
Note 15—
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly provided to the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. For information about how the Company derives revenue, as well as the Company’s accounting policies, refer to “Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
The CODM uses consolidated net income (loss) to assess performance, evaluate cost optimization, and allocate resources, including personnel-related and financial or capital resources, in the annual budget and forecasting process, as well as budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as 
one
 operating and reportable segment.
The following tables set forth significant expense categories and other specified amounts included in consolidated net income (loss) that are otherwise regularly provided to the CODM for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2024. 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This report appears on page 
53
.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
An effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.
Item 9B. Other Information. 
Insider Trading Arrangements
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, one of our directors or officers (as defined in Section 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act)

The Sales Plan included a representation from Ms. Brown to the broker administering the plan that she was not in possession of any material nonpublic information regarding Upwork or the Upwork securities subject to the Sales Plan. A similar representation was made to us in connection with the adoption of the Sales Plan under our Insider Trading Policy.

In making those representations, there is no assurance with respect to any material
