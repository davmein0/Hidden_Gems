Item 2. Properties. 
Our corporate headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California, where we lease approximately 12,685 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in September 2032.
We believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should we require additional office space, suitable additional space will be available in the future. 
See “Note 6—Leases” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our leased properties.
