Item 2.    Properties
At fiscal 2024 year-end,
 we leased approximately 560 operating facilities in domestic and foreign locations. Our significant lease agreements expire at various dates through 2033. We believe that our current facilities are adequate for the operation of our business, and that suitable additional space in various local 
markets is available to accommodate any needs that may arise.
The following table summarizes our ten most significant leased properties by location based on annual rental expenses (listed alphabetically, except for our corporate headquarters):
