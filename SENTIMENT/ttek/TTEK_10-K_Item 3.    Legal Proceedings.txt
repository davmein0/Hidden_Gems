Performance Graph
The following graph shows a comparison of our cumulative total returns with those of the NASDAQ Market Index and the Standard & Poor's ("S&P") 1000 Index. At this time, we do not have a comparable p
eer group due to the combination of our differentiated high-end consulting services and our end-markets. Thus, we have selected the S&P 1000 Index. The graph assumes that the value of an investment in our common stock and in each such index was $100 on September 29, 2019, and that all dividends have been reinvested. Dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2024 totaled $0.220 per share. We declared and paid dividends in the first and second quarters totaling $0.104 per share ($0.052 each quarter) on our common stock and paid dividends in the third and fourth quarters totaling $0.116 per share ($0.058 each quarter) on our common stock. We declared and paid dividends totaling $0.196, $0.172, $0.148 and $0.128 per share in fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The comparison in the graph below is based on historical data and is not intended to forecast the possible future performa
nce of our common stock.
