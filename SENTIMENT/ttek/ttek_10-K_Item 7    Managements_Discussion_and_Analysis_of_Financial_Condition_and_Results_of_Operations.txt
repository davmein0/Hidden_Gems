OVERVIEW OF RESULTS AND BUSINESS TRENDS
General. 

In fiscal 2024, our revenue increased 15.0% compared to fiscal 2023 primarily reflecting increased activity in our U.S. federal and international client sectors. This revenue growth includes $332 million from our recent acquisitions, that did not have comparable revenue for all of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our revenue increased 7.6% compared to the prior-year period.

Our 20.8% growth in U.S. federal revenue in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily reflects increased international development activity and increased environmental activity for both civilian and defense agencies. The growth in our international development activity primarily relates to activity in Ukraine to support energy security and other humanitarian needs. In fiscal 2024, our international development revenue increased approximat
ely $122 million compa
red to fiscal 2023. The overall revenue growth also includes approximately $115 million of revenue from our recent acquisitions, that did not have comparable revenue
 for all la
st year. We expect our U.S. federal government revenue to continue to grow in fiscal 2025. Approximately $1 trillion in new U.S. federal funding passed in 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. Each of these programs includes substantial planned investments in our key end markets including water, environment and sustainable infrastructure over the next five to ten years.

In fiscal 2024, our U.S. state and local government revenue increased compared to last fiscal year due to continued investment by our clients in clean drinking water; this growth was offset by lower disaster response revenue of approximately $46 million primarily due to the wind-down of hurricane related projects in the southeastern U.S. last year. Excluding our disaster response activities, our U.S. state and local government revenue increased 12.4% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting continued increased revenue from advanced water treatment projects. Most of our work for U.S. state and local governments relates to critical water and environmental programs, which we expect to continue to grow in fiscal 2025.

For fiscal 2024, our international revenue increased 20.6% compared to last year primarily due to higher renewable energy revenue and commercial activities related to an increased focus on sustainability in addition to contributions from acquisitions. This revenue growth includes approximately $182 million of revenue from our recent acquisitions, that did not have comparable revenue for all of last year. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our revenue increased 9.6% compared to fiscal 2023. We expect growth in our international work to continue in fiscal 2025.

We believe that the presentation of "Revenue, net of subcontractor costs", which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, enhances investors' ability to analyze our business trends and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by our employees. In the course of providing services, we routinely subcontract various services and, under certain international development programs, issue grants. Generally, these subcontractor costs and grants are passed through to our clients and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and industry practice, are included in our revenue when it is our contractual responsibility to procure or manage these activities. Because subcontractor services can vary significantly from project to project and period to period, changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of our business trends. Accordingly, we segregate subcontractor costs from revenue to promote a better understanding of our business by evaluating revenue exclusive of costs associated with external service providers.
NM = not meaningful
Our revenue growth in fiscal 2024 reflects increases in both of our reportable segments. Our GSG segment's revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $324.5 million, or 15.0%, and $274.5 million, or 16.8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 compar
ed to last y
ear. Our CIG segment's revenue increased $362.1 million, or 14.9%, and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $296.2 million, or 14.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 results for GSG and CIG segments are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Group", respectively.
The following table reconciles our reported results to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted results, which exclude acquisition and integration costs and adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2024. Our fiscal 2023 adjusted results exclude acquisition and integrations costs related to the RPS acquisition and related lease impairment charge and adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities. Our adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") for fiscal 2023 also excludes non-operating gains on a foreign exchange contract of $89.4 million and non-recurring tax expense items. The foreign exchange gain is reported as "Other non-operating income" in our consolidated statements of income. The effective tax rate applied to the adjustments to EPS to arrive at adjusted EPS was 17% and 26% for fisc
al 2024 and 2023, r
espectively. The fiscal 2024 rate reflects certain integration costs/losses that were not tax deductible. We applied the relevant marginal statutory tax rate based on the nature of the adjustments and the tax jurisdiction in which it occurred. Both EPS and adjusted EPS were calculated using diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the respective periods as reflected in our consolidated statem
ents 
of income.

Non-U.S. GAAP financial measure
Operating income in fiscal 2024 includes $7.1 million of acquisition and integration expenses (non-cash divestiture and asset impairment charges). The fiscal 2023 results include $33.2 million of acquisition and integration expenses (primarily investment banking, legal and other professional fees) for the RPS acquisition and a related $16.4 million lease right-of-use asset ("ROU") impairment expense. The fiscal 2024 and 2023 results also include charges of $2.5 million and $12.3 million, respectively, related to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities. Excluding the acquisition and integration expenses and earn-out charges, our adjusted operating income increased $90.5 million, or 21.6% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. These increases reflect improved results in both of our operating segments, which are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Group", respectively.

Net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2024 compared to last fiscal year primarily due to the lower borrowing costs from our convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes") issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which we used to refinance the existing higher-cost debt. In fiscal 2023, net interest expense included $2.7 million of additional expense for the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees due to the cancellation of the bridge loan facility that we entered to support our offer to acquire RPS, which was replaced with an amendment to our existing debt facility and $1.1 million of additional expense for the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees due to the repayment of RPS' debt facilities. Excluding these write-offs, our interest expense decreased $5.5 million in fiscal 2024 compared to last year.

Other non-operating income in fiscal 2023 reflects gains on a foreign exchange forward contract integrated with the acquisition of RPS. Although an effective economic hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to this transaction, the forward contract did not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the forward contract was marked-to-market with changes in fair value 
37
recognized in earnings each period. The forward contract was settled on January 23, 2023, together with the closing of the RPS acquisition, with a cumulative cash gain of approximately $109 million.

The effective tax rates for fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 28.1% and 31.8%, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by
 $4.5 millio
n and $4.6 million of excess tax benefits on share-based payments in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, income tax expense in fiscal 2024 included $4.2 million of expense for the settlement of various tax positions that were under audit for fiscal years 2011 through 2021. Furthermore, income tax expense in fiscal 2023 included non-operating income tax expenses totaling $20.6 million to (i) increase the tax liability for uncertain tax positions related to certain U.S. tax credits and an intercompany financing transaction, (ii) recognize the tax liability for foreign earnings, primarily in the United Kingdom and Australia, that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits on share-based payments in both years, the settlement amount in fiscal 2024 and the non-operating tax expenses in fiscal 2023, our effective tax rates in fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 28.1% and 27.8%, respectively.
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") released Pillar Two Model Rules (also referred to as the global minimum tax or Global Anti-Base Erosion "GloBE" rules), which were designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum 15 percent level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted these rules, which are effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We are continually monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impacts. At this time, we do not anticipate a material tax charge as a result of implementation of these rules.

For fiscal 2024, the revenue growth of 15.0% compared to fiscal 2023 primarily reflects higher U.S. federal government activities related to international development, U.S. state and local government activities related to advanced water treatment and contributions from our recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by lower disaster response activity. The revenue growth in fiscal 2024 include
s a $122 million increase from the aforementioned international development activities in Ukraine compared to last year. For fiscal 2024, our revenue
 growth also includes approximately $128 million of revenue from our recent acquisitions, that did not have comparable revenue for all of fiscal 2023. Conversely, our revenue growth also includes decreased revenue from disaster response activities, which was approximately $46 million lower in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Excluding the acquisitions, increased activity in Ukraine and the partially offsetting lower disaster response revenue, our revenue increased 6.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to last year. 
Operating income increased primarily due to the aforementioned revenue growth. Additionally, our fiscal 2023 operating income was reduced by $6.8 million of the aforementioned lease impairment charge. Excluding last year's lease impairment charge, our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased to 14.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2023.

For fiscal 2024, the revenue growth of 14.9% compared to fiscal 2023 primarily reflects increased activities related to renewable energy and international sustainable infrastructure in addition to contributions from acquisitions. The revenue growth in fiscal 2024 includes approximately $205 million from the RPS acquisition that did not have comparable revenue in fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of the RPS acquisition, our revenue increased 6.5% in fiscal 2024 compared to last year.
For fiscal 2024, our operating income increased due to the aforementioned revenue growth. Additionally, our operating income in fiscal 2023 was reduced by $8.3 million of the aforementioned lease impairment charge. Our operating margin also improved in fiscal 2024 compared to last year resulting in enhanced operating income. Excluding the lease impairment charge last year, our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, improved approximately 170 basis points from 11.9% in fiscal 2023 to 13.6% in this fiscal year. The improved operating margin was primarily due to our increased focus on high-end consulting services, and improved project execution, particularly in the RPS operations.

In fiscal 2023, revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $1.02 billion, or 29.1%, and $915.5 million, or 32.3%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2022. Excluding the contribution from RPS, our revenue increased 12.0% in fiscal 2023 compared to the previous year. Our GSG segment's revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $338.0 million, or 18.6%, and $299.0 million, or 22.4%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Our CIG segment's revenue increased $686.2 million, or 39.5%, and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $616.5 million, or 41.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to the previous year. Excluding the contribution from RPS, our CIG segment's revenue increased approximately 6.7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (9.5% on a constant currency basis).

The fiscal 2023 results for GSG and CIG segments are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Services Group", respectively.
The following table reconciles our reported results to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted results, which exclude our acquisition and integration costs related to the RPS acquisition, a related lease impairment charge and adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2023, and a non-operating benefit from Employee Retention Credits ("ERC's") received in fiscal 2022. Our adjusted EPS also excludes non-operating gains on a foreign exchange contract of $89.4 million for fiscal 2023 and $19.9 million for fiscal 2022, as well as non-recurring tax expense items for fiscal 2023. The foreign exchange gain is reported as "Other non-operating income" in our consolidated statements of income. The effective tax rates applied to the adjustments to EPS to arrive at adjusted EPS average 26% for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. We applied the relevant marginal statutory tax rate based on the nature of the adjustments and the tax jurisdiction in which it occurred. Both EPS and adjusted EPS were calculated using diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the respective periods as reflected in our consolidated statements of income.

Non-U.S. GAAP financial measure
Operating income increased $17.7 million, or 5.2%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The fiscal 2023 results include $33.2 million of acquisition and integration expenses (primarily investment banking, legal and other professional fees) for the RPS acquisition and a related $16.4 million of ROU lease asset impairment expense. The fiscal 2023 results also include losses of $12.3 million, related to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities. The fiscal 2022 results include the benefit of Employee Retention Credits ("ERC's") totaling $6.5 million, which represents reimbursement from the U.S. federal government under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") for the costs that 
40
we incurred during fiscal 2020 to address the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. These amounts were recognized in fiscal 2022 when the funds were received due to the uncertainty related to the computation of qualifying amounts and delayed processing times for our application. These amounts were primarily reflected as a reduction to "Other costs of revenue" in our consolidated statement of income and an increase to "Net cash provided by operating activities" in our consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal 2022, consistent with the presentation of the related costs recognized in fiscal 2020.
Excluding the acquisition and integration expenses, ROU asset impairment, earn-out losses and the ERC's, our adjusted operating income increased $86.0 million, or 25.7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. These increases reflect improved results in both GSG and CIG segments, which are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Group", respectively.

Our net interest expense was $46.5 million and $11.6 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net interest expense in fiscal 2023 included $2.7 million of additional expense for the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees due to the cancellation of the bridge loan facility that we entered to support our offer to acquire RPS, which was replaced with an amendment to our existing debt facility and $1.1 million of additional expense for the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees due to the repayment and cancellation of RPS' debt facilities.

Excluding these write-offs, our interest expense increased $31.2 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the additional borrowings to fund the RPS acquisition.
Other non-operating income of $89.4 million in fiscal 2023 and $19.9 million in fiscal 2022, reflect the previously described gain on a foreign exchange forward contract integrated with the RPS acquisition.  
The effective tax rates for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 31.8% and 24.5%, respectively. Income tax expense in fiscal 2023 included non-operating income tax expenses totaling $20.6 million to (i) increase the tax liability for uncertain tax positions related to certain U.S. tax credits and an intercompany financing transaction, (ii) recognize the tax liability for foreign earnings, primarily in the United Kingdom and Australia, that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. In addition, income tax expense was reduced by $4.6 million and $10.3 million of excess tax benefits on share-based payments in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of the non-operating tax expenses in fiscal 2023 and the excess tax benefits on share-based payments in both years, our effective tax rates in fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 27.8% and 27.5%.

Revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $338.0 million, or 18.6%, and increased $299.0 million, or 22.4%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This increase includes approximately $70 million in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 related to a distinct international development funded energy program in Ukraine. In addition, the increases reflect higher U.S. state and local government activities related to digital water and U.S. federal programs, partially offset by lower disaster response revenue. 
Operating income increased $33.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase in operating income is consistent with the revenue increase noted above. The fiscal 2023 results were reduced by $6.8 million of the aforementioned lease impairment charge and the fiscal 2022 results included $4.4 million of the aforementioned ERC's. Our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, was 14.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to 14.8% the previous year. Excluding the lease impairment charge in fiscal 2023 and the ERC's in fiscal 2022, our operating margin increased to 14.6% in fiscal 2023 from 14.5% in fiscal 2022.

The RPS acquisition contributed approximately $570 million to revenue growth in fiscal 2023. The remaining revenue growth in fiscal 2023 primarily reflects increased activity on high-performance buildings, clean energy and international infrastructure.  
Operating income increased $49.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The RPS acquisition contributed approximately $34 million to operating income in fiscal 2023. Conversely, the fiscal 2023 results were reduced by $8.3 million of the aforementioned lease impairment charge. The fiscal 2022 operating income included $1.9 million of the aforementioned ERC's. Our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, was 11.5% in fiscal 2023 compared to 13.0% in fiscal 2022. Excluding the lease impairment and RPS in fiscal 2023 and the ERC's in fiscal 2022, our operating margin was 13.3% in fiscal 2023 compared to 12.8% in fiscal 2022. The improved operating margin was primarily due to our increased focus on high-end consulting services, project execution and higher labor utilization.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Requirements.

At September 29, 2024, we had $232.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and access to an additional $800 million of borrowing available under our credit facility. We generated $358.7 million of cash from operations in fiscal 2024. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are to fund working capital, cash dividends, capital expenditures and repayment of debt, as well as to fund acquisitions and earn-out obligations from prior acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement as described below, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
On October 5, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we could repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock.
 In fiscal 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.

At fiscal 2024 year-end, we had a remaining balance of
 $347.8 million 
under our stock repurchase program.
 We declared and paid common stock dividends totaling $58.8 million, or $0.220 per share, in fiscal 2024 compared to $52.1 million, or $0.196 per share, in fiscal 2023.
Subsequent Events.

On November 11, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.058 per share payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 27, 2024.

Operating Activities.

 Cash from operations in fiscal 2024 decreased 2.6% compared to fiscal 2023. Our cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023 benefited from improved management of working capital through faster collection of accounts receivable compared to previous years. This trend was stable in fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, we paid $10.5 million less in interest compared to last year, primarily due the lower borrowing costs from our convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which we used to refinance the existing higher-cost debt incurred to fund the RPS acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This improvement and the benefit of higher earnings in fiscal 2024 were substantially offset by higher income tax payments. We paid $27 million in U.S. federal income tax in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 that typically would have been made in fiscal 2023, but the IRS permitted, and we elected, 2023 federal tax payment deferrals for entities in disaster zones. 
Investing Activities.

For fiscal 2024, the cash used in investing activities includes net payments of $94 million for the acquisitions completed during the year. The fiscal 2023 period reflects $854 million of net payments for the acquisitions completed last year (primarily RPS), net of the $109 million of related foreign exchange hedge proceeds received in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
Financing Activities.

For fiscal 2024, net cash provided by financing activities declined. The decrease was due to a net borrowing of $544 million in fiscal 2023 versus net debt repayments of $70 million in fiscal 2024. The fiscal 2023 borrowings were used primarily to fund our fiscal 2023 acquisitions. To a lesser extent, the decline in our net cash provided by financing activities was due to $25 million more cash used for contingent earn-out payments in fiscal 2024 compared to last year.
Debt Financing.

On October 26, 2022, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for an additional $500 million senior secured term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility") increasing our total borrowing capacity to $1.55 billion. 
On January 23, 2023, we drew the entire amount of the New Term Loan Facility to partially finance the RPS acquisition. 
The New Term Loan Facility is not subject to any amortization payments of principal and matures in January 2026.
On February 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”) with a total borrowing capacity of $1.05 billion that will mature in February 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement is a $750 million senior secured, five-year facility that provides for a $250 million term loan facility (the “Amended Term Loan Facility”) and a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a $300 million accordion feature that allows us to increase the Amended Credit Agreement to $1.05 billion subject to lender approval. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) refinance indebtedness under our Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2018; (ii) finance open market repurchases of common stock, acquisitions and cash dividends and distributions; and (iii) utilize the proceeds for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a reduction in the interest grid for meeting certain sustainability targets related to the (i) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the Company’s projects and operational sustainability initiatives and (ii) improvement of peoples’ lives as a result of the Company’s projects that provide environmental, social and governance benefits. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $300 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit.
The entire Amended Term Loan Facility was drawn on February 18, 2022. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a benchmark rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.875% per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that ranges from 0% to 0.875% per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on February 18, 2027, or earlier at our discretion upon payment in full of loans and other obligations. In fiscal 2023, we repaid the Amended Term Loan Facility in full with the Convertible Notes proceeds.
43
On August 22, 2023, we issued $575.0 million in convertible notes that bear interest at 2.25% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2024 with a maturity date of August 15, 2028 (the "Convertible Notes"). As of October 1, 2023, $560.8 million of the Convertible Notes was included in long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets, which is net of $14.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were $560.5 million, $51.8 million of which were used to purchase related capped call transactions on the issue date. The remaining proceeds were used to prepay and terminate the $234.4 million outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, to prepay $89.4 million outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility and to pay down borrowings of $185.0 million under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 9, "Long-Term Debt" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 for further discussion.
 At fiscal 2024 year-end, we had $250 million in outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, which consisted of $250 million under the New Term Loan Facility and no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement during fiscal 2024 was 6.70%. In addition, we had $0.7 million in standby letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement. At September 29, 2024, we had $499.3 million of available credit under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, all of which could be borrowed without a violation of our debt covenants. Commitment fees related to our revolving credit facilities were $0.8 million, $0.6 million, and $0.7 million for fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and restrictive covenants, and customary events of default. The financial covenants provide for a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 (total funded debt/EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 (EBITDA/Consolidated Interest Charges, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on (i) the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) the accounts receivable, general intangibles and intercompany loans, and those of our subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers. At September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants with a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.38x and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 13.94x. 
In addition to the Amended Credit Agreement, we maintain other credit facilities, which may be used for short-term cash advances and bank guarantees. At September 29, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities, and the aggregate amount of standby letters of credit outstanding was $43.3 million. As of September 29, 2024, we had no bank overdrafts related to our disbursement bank accounts.  
Inflation.

We believe our operations have not been, and, in the foreseeable future, are not expected to be, materially adversely affected by inflation or changing prices due to the average duration of our projects and our ability to negotiate prices as contracts end and new contracts begin.

Income Taxes
We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and adjust the allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The ability or failure to achieve the forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets. Based on future operating results in certain jurisdictions, it is unlikely that the current valuation allowance positions of those jurisdictions could be adjusted in the next 12 months.
At the end of fiscal 2024 and 2023, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $50.1 million and $62.0 million, respectively. 
44
It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions may not significantly decrease within the next 12 months. 
These liabilities represent our current estimates of the additional tax liabilities that we may be assessed when the related audits are concluded. If these audits are resolved in a manner more unfavorable than our current expectations, our additional tax liabilities could be materially higher than the amounts currently recorded resulting in additional tax expense.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we may use off-balance sheet arrangements if we believe that such arrangements would be an efficient way to lower our cost of capital or help us manage the overall risks of our business operations. We do not believe that such arrangements have had a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations.    
The following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements:
•
Letters of credit and bank guarantees are used primarily to support project performance and insurance programs. We are required to reimburse the issuers of letters of credit and bank guarantees for any payments they make under the outstanding letters of credit or bank guarantees. Our Amended Credit Agreement and additional letter of credit facilities cover the issu
ance of our standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and are critical for our normal operations. If we default on the Amended Credit Agreement or additional credit facilities, our inability to issue or renew standby letters of credit and bank guarantees would impair our ability to maintain normal operations. At fiscal 2024 year-end,
 we had $0.7 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement and $43.3 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our additional letter of credit facilities.
•
From time to time, we provide guarantees and indemnifications related to our services. If our services under a guaranteed or indemnified project are later determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed or indemnified projects is available and monetary damages or other costs or losses are determined to be probable, we recognize such guaranteed losses.
•
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements as part of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts where we are jointly and severally liable. We enter into these agreements primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is typically the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. However, we are not able to estimate other amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts and, accordingly, the total potential payment amount under our outstanding performance guarantees cannot be estimated. For cost-plus contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed-price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, we may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors, for claims.
•
In the ordinary course of business, our clients may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We are obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made thereunder. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of our related contractual obligation.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in Item 8 of this report. In order to understand better the changes that may occur to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, readers should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Our significant accounting policies are described in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8. Highlighted below are the accounting policies that management considers most critical to investors' understanding of our financial results and condition, and that require complex judgments by management.
45
Revenue Recognition and Contract Costs
To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", we evaluate whether multiple contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as having more than one performance obligation. The decision to combine a group of contracts or separate a combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations may impact the amount of revenue recorded in a given period. Contracts are considered to have a single performance obligation if the promises are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts. 
At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised in a contract and identify, as a separate performance obligation, each distinct promise to transfer goods or services to the customer. The identified performance obligations represent the “units of account” for purposes of determining revenue recognition. In order to properly identify separate performance obligations, we apply judgment in determining whether each good or service provided is: (a) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and (b) distinct within the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most of our contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct from existing contracts due to the significant integration provided or significant interdependencies in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of the original contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. 
We account for contract modifications as a separate contract when the modification results in the promise to deliver additional goods or services that are distinct and the increase in price of the contract is for the same amount as the stand-alone selling price of the additional goods or services included in the modification.
The transaction price represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to our customers. The consideration promised within a contract may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fee incentives, fiscal funding clauses and liquidated damages. We recognize revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized for the contract will not occur. We estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using either the expected value or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount of consideration to be received. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using a best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined using the estimated cost of the contract plus a margin approach. For contracts containing variable consideration, we allocate the variability to a specific performance obligation within the contract if such variability relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation or transfer the distinct good or service, and the allocation depicts the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled. 
We recognize revenue over time as the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to our customers. Progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is primarily measured using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The cost input is based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. This measure includes forecasts based on the best information available and reflects our judgment to faithfully depict the value of the services transferred to the customer. For certain on-call engineering or consulting and similar contracts, we recognize revenue in the amount which we have the right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value of our performance completed to date. 
Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs indicates a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident. 
46
Contract Types
Our services are performed under three principal types of contracts: fixed-price, time-and-materials and cost-plus. Customer payments on contracts are typically due within 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.
Fixed-Price
. Under fixed-price contracts, clients pay us an agreed fixed-amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. 
Time-and-Materials
.

Under time-and-materials contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we spend on a project. In addition, clients reimburse us for our actual out-of-pocket costs for materials and other direct incidental expenditures that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract. Most of our time-and-material contracts are subject to maximum contract values, and also may include annual billing rate adjustment provisions.
Cost-Plus
. Under cost-plus contracts, we are reimbursed for allowed or otherwise defined costs incurred plus a negotiated fee. The contracts may also include incentives for various performance criteria, including quality, timeliness, ingenuity, safety and cost-effectiveness. In addition, our costs are generally subject to review by our clients and regulatory audit agencies, and such reviews could result in costs being disputed as non-reimbursable under the terms of the contract. 
Goodwill and Intangibles
The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and enhancement of our service offerings.
Identifiable intangible assets primarily include backlog, client relations and trade names. The costs of these intangible assets are amortized over their contractual or economic lives, which range from one to 12 years. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.
Estimated fair value measurements for intangible assets are made using Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow techniques. Fair value is estimated using a multi-period excess earnings method for backlog and client relations and a relief from royalty method for trade names. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value of backlog and client relations include (i) the estimated life the asset will contribute to cash flows, such as remaining contractual terms, (ii) revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, (iii) attrition rate of customers, and (iv) the estimated discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value of trade names include the royalty rates and discount rates.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment review at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter. In addition, we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential change in recoverability of goodwill. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, including
 a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers, negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods (se
e Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 for further discussion).
We believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is impaired are outside of our control, and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes could result in future impairments.
The goodwill impairment review involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units, which for us are the components one level below our reportable segments. This process requires us to make significant judgments and estimates, including assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations as well as the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations. Furthermore, the development of the present value of future cash flow projections includes assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our expected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, business plans, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We also make certain assumptions about future market conditions, market prices, interest rates and changes in business strategies. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit. This could eliminate the excess of fair value over carrying value of a reporting unit entirely and, in some cases, result in impairment. Such changes in assumptions could be caused by a loss of one or more significant contracts, reductions in government or commercial client spending or a decline in the demand for our services due to changing economic conditions. In the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired, we would be 
47
required to record a non-cash charge that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
We use two methods to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (i) the Income Approach and (ii) the Market Approach. While each of these approaches is initially considered in the valuation of the business enterprises, the nature and characteristics of the reporting units indicate which approach is most applicable. The Income Approach utilizes the discounted cash flow method, which focuses on the expected cash flow of the reporting unit. In applying this approach, the cash flow available for distribution is calculated for a finite period of years. Cash flow available for distribution is defined, for purposes of this analysis, as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing the future profitability or operations of the reporting unit. The cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the estimation period) are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of the value of the business enterprise. The Market Approach is comprised of the guideline company method and the similar transactions method. The guideline company method focuses on comparing the reporting unit to select reasonably similar (or "guideline") publicly traded companies. Under this method, valuation multiples are (i) derived from the operating data of selected guideline companies; (ii) evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting units relative to the selected guideline companies; and (iii) applied to the operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of value. In the similar transactions method, consideration is given to prices paid in recent transactions that have occurred in the reporting unit's industry or in related industries. For our annual impairment analysis, we weighted the Income Approach and the Market Approach at 70% and 30%, respectively. The Income Approach was given a higher weight because it has the most direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting unit, as compared to the Market Approach, which is based on multiples of broad-based (i.e., less comparable) companies
. 
Our last review at July 1, 2024 (i.e., the first day of our fourth quarter in fiscal 2024), indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill, and all of our reporting units had estimated fair values that were in excess of their carrying values, including goodwill. We had no reporting units that had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 72%.
Contingent Consideration
Certain of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating income thresholds. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based upon our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved.
The fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in "Estimated contingent earn-out liabilities" and "Long-term estimated contingent earn-out liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former shareholders of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.
We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (See Note 2, "Basis of Presentation – Fair Value of Financial Instruments" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8). We use a probability weighted discounted income approach as a valuation technique to convert future estimated cash flows to a single present value amount. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are operating income projections over the earn-out period (generally two or three years), and the probability outcome percentages we assign to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities related to the time component of the present value calculation are reported in interest expense. Adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in operating income.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
48
For a discussion of recent accounting standards and the effect they could have on the consolidated financial statements, see Note 2, "Basis of Presentation" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes. In the normal course of business, we have exposure to both interest rate risk and foreign currency transaction and translation risk, primarily related to the Canadian and Australian dollars, the Euro, and the British Pound. 
We are exposed to interest rate risk under our Amended Credit Agreement. We can borrow, at our option, under both the Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a Eurocurrency rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.875% per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the SOFR rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin that ranges from 0% to 0.875% per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions. Borrowings at the base rate have no designated term and may be repaid without penalty any time prior to the Facility’s maturity date. Borrowings at a SOFR rate have a term no less than 30 days and no greater than 180 days and may be prepaid without penalty. Typically, at the end of such term, such borrowings may be rolled over at our discretion into either a borrowing at the base rate or a borrowing at a SOFR rate with similar terms, not to exceed the maturity date of the Facility. The Facility matures on February 18, 2027. At September 29, 2024, we had $250 million in outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, which was consisted of $250 million under the New Term Loan Facility, and no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The year-to-date weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2024 was 6.70%. 
The majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars; however, some of our subsidiaries conduct business in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars, the Euro, and British Pound. Therefore, we are subject to currency exposure and volatility because of currency fluctuations. We attempt to minimize our exposure to these fluctuations by matching revenue and expenses in the same currency for our contrac
ts. We reported $1.8 million of foreign currency losses in fiscal 2024 in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statement of income. The impact of foreign currency was immaterial in fiscal 2023. 
We have foreign currency exchange rate exposure in our results of operations and equity primarily because of the currency translation related to our foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in reduced revenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities. Similarly, our revenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities will increase if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, 38.5% and 36.7% of our consolidated revenue, respectively, was generated by our international business. For fiscal 2024, the effect of foreign exchange rate translation on the consolidated balance sheets was an increase in equity of $115.1 million compared to an increase in equity of $12.6 million in fiscal 2023. These amounts were recognized as an adjustment to equity through other comprehensive income. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a forward contract to acquire GBP 714.0 million at a rate of 1.0852 for a total of USD 774.8 million that was integrated with our plan to acquire RPS. This contract matured on December 30, 2022. On December 28, 2022, we entered into an extension of the integrated forward contract to acquire GBP 714.0 million at a rate of 1.086 for a total of USD 775.4 million, extending the maturity date to January 23, 2023, the closing date of the RPS acquisition. Although an effective economic hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to this transaction, the forward contract did not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the forward contract was marked-to-market with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The intrinsic value of the forward contract was immaterial at inception as the GBP/USD spot and forward exchange rates were essentially the same. The fair value of the forward contract at October 2, 2022 was $19.9 million, and an unrealized gain of the same amount was recognized in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 results. On January 23, 2023, the forward contract was settled for cash proceeds of $109.3 million and we recognized additional gains of $89.4 million in fiscal 2023. All gains related to this transaction were reported in “Other non-operating income" on our consolidated income statements for the respective periods.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the

Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tetra Tech, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tetra Tech, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded LS Technologies ("LST") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded LST from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. LST is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management's assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 29, 2024.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
51
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter

arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Revenue Recognition - Certain fixed-price, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue of $5,199 million for the year ended September 29, 2024, of which a majority relates to revenue recognized for certain fixed-price, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to the Company's customers. Progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is primarily measured using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The cost input is based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. This measure includes forecasts based on the best information available and reflects management's judgment to depict the value of the services transferred to the customer. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. For certain on-call engineering or consulting and similar contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount which they have the right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for certain fixed-price, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts is a critical audit matter is a high degree of audit effort in performing procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating management’s significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition; (ii) for certain fixed-price contracts, testing management's process for developing the estimate of total contract cost for a sample of contracts with cumulative catch-up adjustments and anticipated losses or claims, and evaluating the contract terms and other documents that support the changes in total estimated contract costs; (iii) assessing, for a sample of fixed-price contracts, estimated total contract costs by performing a comparison of the total estimated contract cost as compared with prior period estimates and evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to the total estimated contract cost; (iv) evaluating, for certain contracts, management’s methodologies and assessing the consistency of management’s methodology over the life of the contract; (v) re-calculating revenue recognized based on the contract value, year-to-date costs, and total estimated costs to complete; (vi) testing the existence and accuracy of total contract revenue recorded, on a sample basis, by obtaining and inspecting source documents such as contracts and purchase orders; (vii) for certain on-call engineering or consulting contracts where revenue is recognized using the practical expedient right to invoice, testing the accuracy of revenue recognized, on a sample basis by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts and purchase orders; and (viii) for certain contracts, testing the completeness and accuracy of costs incurred to date, on a sample basis, by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as invoices and timecards.

Tetra Tech, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1.           
Description of Business 
We are a leading global provider of high-end consulting and engineering services that focuses on water, environment and sustainable infrastructure. We are a global company that is 
Leading with Science® 
to provide innovative solutions for our public and private clients. We typically begin at the earliest stage of a project by identifying technical solutions and developing execution plans tailored to our clients’ needs and resources. 
Our solutions may span the entire life cycle of high-end consulting and engineering projects and include applied science, data analysis, research, engineering, design, project management and operations and maintenance.
We manage our business under 
two
 reportable segments. Our Government Services Group (“GSG”) reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and all activities with development agencies worldwide. Our Commercial/International Services Group (“CIG”) reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. commercial clients and international clients other than development agencies.
2.           
Basis of Presentation
Principles of Consolidation.
    The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of joint ventures of which we are the primary beneficiary
 and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and expressed 
in 
U.S. dollars. 
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year.  
We operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the Sunday nearest September 3
0. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 are 52-week years.

Use of Estimates.
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions we may take in the future, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical facts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Stock Split.
    On July 29, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 
five
-for-one stock split of our common stock. The stock split had a record date of September 5, 2024 and an effective date of September 6, 2024. The par value per share of our common stock remains unchanged at $
0.01
 per share after the stock split. All prior-period share or per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
    Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
90
 days or less. 
Occasionally, we have bank overdrafts, which occur when a bank honors disbursements in excess of funds on deposit in our bank accounts. We classify bank overdrafts as 
short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets, and report the change in overdrafts as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Insurance Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. 
In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. We record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability for these legal and insurance obligations.  Any adjustments to these liabilities are recorded in our consolidated statements of income.
Accounts Receivable - Net.
 Net accounts receivable consists of billed and unbilled accounts receivable, and allowances for doubtful accounts. Billed accounts receivable represent amounts billed to clients that have not been collected. Unbilled accounts 
receivable, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or billed after the period end date. Substantially all of our unbilled receivables at fiscal 2024 year-end are expected to be billed and collected within 
12
 months. Unbilled accounts receivable also include amounts related to requests for equitable adjustment to contracts that provide for price redetermination. These amounts are recorded only when they can be reliably estimated, and realization is probabl
e. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that are expected to become uncollectible or unrealizable in the future. We determine an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts based on management's consideration of trends in the actual and forecasted credit quality of our clients, including delinquency and payment history; type of client, such as a government agency or a commercial sector client; and general economic and industry conditions that may affect our clients' ability to pay.

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities. 
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of the amounts for which we have the contractual right to bill our customers. Contract retentions, included in contract assets, represent amounts withheld by clients until certain conditions are met or the project is completed, which may extend beyond one year. Contract 
59
liabilities represent the amount of cash collected from clients and billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed and revenue recognized. The majority of these amounts are expected be earned within 12 months and are classified as current liabilities.
Prepaid and other current assets.
    Prepaid assets consist primarily of payments for insurance and software costs and are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. Other current assets include primarily sales/services and use tax receivables from our U.S and foreign operations.
Property and Equipment.
    Property and equipment are recorded at cost and d
epreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Generally, estimated useful lives range from 
three
 to 
seven years
 for equipment, furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount (i.e., net book value) and fair value less cost to sell, and are reported within "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" on our consolidated balance sheets.  Once assets are classified as held for sale, they are no longer depreciated.

Long-Lived Assets.
   We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired. This assessment is performed based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows compared to the carrying value of the assets. If the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.
Leases.    
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, and current and long-term operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Our finance leases are reported in "Other long-term assets", "Other current liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet. 
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the
 present value of lease payments over the lease term. 
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, incremental borrowing rates are used based on 
the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset at the commencement date also includes any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and initial direct costs less lease incentives received. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We recognize a liability for contra
ct termination costs associated with an exit activity for costs that will continue to be incurred under a lease for its remaining term without economic benefit to us, initially measured at its fair value at the cease-use date. The fair value is determined based on the remaining lease rentals, adjusted for the effects of any prepaid or deferred items recognized under the lease, and reduced by estimated sublease rentals.
Business Combinations.
    The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of these assets and liabilities requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and enhancement of our service offerings. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
    Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Following an acquisition, we perform an analysis to value the acquired company's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities. With respect to identifiable intangible assets, we consider backlog, non-compete agreements, client relations, trade names, patents and other assets. We amortize our intangible assets based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be realized. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.
We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently when an event occurs, or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is 
60
impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes could result in future impairments.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment review at the beginning of our fiscal fourth qu
arter. Our last annual review was performed at July 1, 2024 (i.e., the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter). In addition, we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential change in recoverability of goodwill. We perf
orm interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, including a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers, negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or 
one
 level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments and our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are the components 
one
 level below our reportable segments. These components constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics.
The impairment test for goodwill involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of reporting units based on a comparison and weighting of the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method and the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon comparable market prices and recent transactions and also validates the reasonableness of the multiples from the income approach. The development of the present value of future cash flow projections includes assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our expected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rates and the terminal growth rate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if its carrying value exceeds its fair value, our goodwill is impaired, and we are required to record a non-cash charge that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. An impairment loss recognized, if any, should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Contingent Consideration.
    Most of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating income thresholds. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based upon our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved.
The fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in "Current contingent earn-out liabilities" and "Long-term contingent earn-out liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former owners of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.
We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We use a probability weighted discounted income approach as a valuation technique to convert future estimated cash flows to a single present value amount. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are operating income projections over the earn-out period (generally 
three
 or 
five years
) and the probability outcome percentages we assign to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
We review and reassess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities related to the time component of the present value calculation are reported in interest expense. Adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in operating income.
61
Other Current Liabilities.
    Other current liabilities consist primarily of accrued insurance, contingent liabilities, sales/services and use taxes due to our U.S. and foreign operations, other tax accruals and accrued professional fees.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
    We determine the fair values of our financial instruments, including short-term investments, debt instruments, derivative instruments
 and pension plan assets bas
ed on inputs or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. We categorize our instruments using a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values based on their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of our revolving credit facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are based upon variable reference rates. Certain other assets and liabilities, such as contingent earn-out liabilities and amounts related to cash-flow hedges, are required to be carried in our consolidated financial statements at fair value.
Our fair value measurement methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
Derivative Financial Instruments.
    We account for our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carry them at fair value. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. 
The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in a non-functional currency in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to these derivative instruments are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current income.
Deferred Compensation.
    We maintain a non-qualified defined contribution supplemental retirement plan for certain key employees and non-employee directors that is accounted for in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested. Employee deferrals are deposited into a rabbi trust, and the funds are generally invested in individual variable life insurance contracts that we own and are specifically designed to informally fund savings plans of this nature. Our consolidated balance sheets reflect our investment in variable life insurance contracts in "Other long-term assets." Our obligation to participating employees is reflected in "Other long-term liabilities." 
The net gains and losses related to the deferred compensation plan are 
reported as part of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of income
.

Pension Plan
.    We assumed a defined benefit pension plan from an acquisition. We calculate the market-related value of assets, which is used to determine the return-on-assets component of annual pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. This calculation reflects our anticipated long-term rate of return and amortization of the difference between the actual return (including capital, dividends, and interest) and the expected return. Cumulative net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market-related value of plan assets are subject to amortization.
Income Taxes.
    We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, we file other returns that are required in the states, foreign jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which we do business. We account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management reviews both positive and negative evidence, including current and historical results of operations, future income projections, scheduled reversals of deferred tax amounts, availability of carrybacks and potential tax planning strategies. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
62
According to the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.
Concentration of Credit Risk.
    Financial instruments that subject us to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and net accounts receivable. In th
e event that we have surplus cash, we place our temporary cash investments with lower ri
sk financial institutions and, by policy, limit the amount of investment exposure to any 
one
 financial institution. Approximately 
24
% of accounts receivable were due from various agencies of the U.S. federal government at fiscal 2024 year-end. The remaining accounts receivable are generally diversified due to the large number of organizations comprising our client base and their geographic dispersion. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.
 Approximately 
32
%, 
12
%, 
18
% and 
38
% of our fiscal 2024 revenue was generated from our U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local government, U.S. commercial and international clients, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation.
    We determine the fu
nctional currency of our foreign operating units based upon the primary currency in which they operate. These operating units maintain their accounting records in their local currency, primarily Canadian and Australian dollars, Euros and British pounds. Where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, translation of assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars is based on exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Translation of revenue and expenses to U.S. dollars is based on the average rate during the period. Translation gains or losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in income from operations.
Recently Issued Accounting Pro
nouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires that an entity report segment information in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments in the ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2025 for us). Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements; however, we do not plan to adopt Topic 280 before fiscal 2025.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in the ASU are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2026 for us). Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements; however, we do not plan to adopt Topic 740 before fiscal 2026.
3.           
Revenue and Contract Balances
We recognize revenue over time as the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to our customers. Progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is primarily measured using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The cost input is based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. This measure includes forecasts based on the best information available and reflects our judgement to faithfully depict the value of the services transferred to the customer. For certain on-call engineering or consulting and similar contracts, we recognize revenue in the amount which we have the right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value of our performance completed to date.
Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs indicates a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident.
63
Disaggregation of Revenue
We disaggregate revenue by client sector and contract type, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Contract Asset
s and Contract Liabilities
We invoice customers based on the contractual terms of each contract. However, the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoice issuance. 
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of the amounts for which we have the contractual right to bill our customers. Such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones or completion of a contract. In addition, many of our time-and-materials arrangements are billed in arrears pursuant to contract terms that are standard within the industry, resulting in contract assets and/or unbilled receivables being recorded, as revenue is recognized in advance of billings. Contract retentions, included in contract assets, represent amounts withheld by clients until certain conditions are met or the project is completed, which may extend beyond one year. 
Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and increase as billings in advance of revenue recognition occur. Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. There were no substantial non-current contract assets or liabilities for the periods presented.

Net contract assets/liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):

Both our contract assets and contract liabilities increased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 year-end, due to the timing of our milestone billing on fixed-price contracts which were different from the timing of revenue recognition on those 
64
contracts. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $
247
 million and $
164
 million, respectively, from amounts included in the contract liability balances at the end of fiscal 2023 and 
2022
, respectively. 
Revenue is recognized by measuring progress over time under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". We estimate and measure progress on our contracts over time whereby we compare our total costs incurred on each contract as a percentage of the total expected contract costs. Changes in t
hose estimates could result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception-to-date revenue, costs and profit in the period in which such changes are made. 
As a result, in fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recognized net favorable revenue and operating income adjustments of $
29.8
 million and 
$
11.0
 million, respective
ly. The corresponding net revenue and operating income adjustments were immaterial for fiscal 2022. 
Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a projected loss, determined at the contract level, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. As of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for anticipated losses of $
15.1
 million and $
8.5
 million, respectively. The estimated cost to complete these related contracts at the end of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was approximately $
101
 million and $

Billed accounts receivable represent amounts billed to clients that have not been collected. Unbilled accounts receivable, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or billed after the period end date. Substantially all of our unbilled receivables at fisc
al 2024 year-end

are expected to be billed and collecte
d within

12
 months. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that are expected to become uncollectible or unrealizable in the future. We determine an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts based on management's consideration of trends in the actual and forecasted credit quality of our clients, including delinquency and payment history; type of client, such as government agency or a commercial sector client; and general economic and industry conditions, which may affect our clients' ability to pay.
Other than the U.S. federal government, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable at fiscal 2024 and 2023 year-ends.
Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligation (“RUPO”)
Our RUPO represents a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. We h
ad $
5.3
 billion of RUPO
 as of September 29, 2024. Our RUPO increases with awards from new contracts or additions to existing contracts and decreases as work is performed and revenue is recognized on existing contracts. Our RUPO may also decrease when projects are canceled or modified in scope. We include a contract within our RUPO when the contract is awarded and an agreement on contract terms has been reached.

Although RUPO reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. 
Our 
RUPO is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. Our operations and maintenance contracts can generally be terminated by the clients without a substantive financial penalty; therefore, the remaining performance obligations on such contracts are limited to the notice period required for the termination (usually 
30
, 
60
 or 
90
 days).

Acquisitions 
In fiscal 2024, we acquired LS Technologies ("LST"), an innovative U.S. federal enterprise technology services and management consulting firm based in Fairfax, Virginia. LST provides high-end consulting and engineering services including advanced data analytics, cybersecurity and digital transformation solutions to U.S. government clients. Additionally, we acquired Convergence Controls & Engineering ("CCE"), an industry leader in process automation and systems integration solutions. CCE’s expertise includes customized digital controls and software solutions, advanced data analytics, cloud data integration and cybersecurity applications. Both LST and CCE are included in our GSG segment. The aggregate fair value of the purchase price of these two acquisitions was $
120
 million. This amount consisted of $
93
 million in initial cash payments, $
4
 million of cash holdback related to a tax reserve, and $
23
 million for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, with a maximum of $
60
 million, based upon the achievement of specified operating income targets in each of the 
66
three years following the acquisition dates. The $
120
 million purchase price was allocated $
12
 million to net tangible assets, $
23
 million to identifiable intangible assets, and $
85
 million to goodwill. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to adjustment as the estimates, assumptions, valuations and other analyses have not yet been finalized in order to make a definitive allocation. These acquisitions were not considered material, individually or in aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. As a result, no pro forma information has been provided.
On September 23, 2022, we made an all-cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of RPS Group plc ("RPS"), a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange for 222 pence per share, through a scheme of arrangement, which was unanimously recommended by RPS' Board of Directors. On November 3, 2022, RPS' shareholders approved the scheme of arrangement.

On January 19, 2023, the court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement to purchase RPS was approved, and we completed the acquisition on January 23, 2023. RPS employed approximately 
5,000
 associates in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia Pacific and North America, delivering high-end solutions, especially in energy transformation, water and program management for government and commercial clients. Substantially all of RPS is included in our CIG segment. 
The total purchase price of RPS was approximately £
633
 million ($
784
 million). In connection with the transaction, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $
33.2
 million, primarily for professional fees, substantially all of which were paid as of fiscal 2023 year-end. On January 23, 2023, we also settled a foreign exchange forward contract that was integral to our plan to finance the RPS acquisition. The cash gain of $
109.3
 million did not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the gain was recognized as non-operating income over the life of the contract and not included in the purchase price allocation below. However, the cash proceeds of $
109.3
 million economically reduced the purchase price for the shares of RPS to approximately $
675
 million. This forward contract is explained further in Note 15, "Derivative Financial Instruments".
The table below represents the purchase price allocation for RPS based on estimates, assumptions, valuations and other analyses as of January 23, 2023. The all cash purchase consideration, excluding the aforementioned forward contract gain, was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets, and liabilities of RPS based on their estimated fair values, with any excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill as follows

Estimated fair value measurements for the intangible assets related to the RPS acquisition were made using Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow techniques. Fair value was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings method for backlog and client relations and a relief from royalty method for trade names.  The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value of backlog and client relations include (i) the estimated life the asset will contribute to cash flows, such as remaining contractual terms, (ii) revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, (iii) attrition rate of customers, and (iv) the estimated discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value of trade names include the royalty rates and discount rates.

 per share, before the related intangible amortization of $

In fiscal 2023, we also acquired Amyx, Inc. (“Amyx”), an enterprise technology services, cybersecurity and management consulting firm based in Reston, Virginia. With over 
500
 employees, Amyx provides application modernization, cybersecurity, systems engineering, financial management and program management support on over 
30
 Federal Government programs. Amyx is included in our Government Services Group ("GSG") segment. The total fair value of the purchase price of Amyx was $
120.9
 million, consisted of a $
100.0
 million payable in a promissory note issued to the sellers (paid subsequent to closing), $
8.7
 million of payables related to estimated post-closing adjustments, and $
12.2
 million for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, with a maximum of $
25.0
 million, based upon the achievement of specified operating income targets in each of the three years following the acquisition date. Amyx was not considered material to our consolidated financial statements. As a result, no pro forma information has been provided.
In fiscal 2022, we acquired The Integration Group of America ("TIGA"), Piteau Associates (“PAE”) and two other financially immaterial acquisitions.  TIGA is based in Spring, Texas and is an industry leader in process automation and system integration solutions, including customized software and platform (SaaS/PaaS) applications, advanced data analytics, cloud data integration and platform virtualization. PAE is based in Vancouver, British Columbia and is a global leader in sustainable natural resource analytics including hydrologic numerical modeling and dewatering system design. PAE is part of our CIG segment, and TIGA and other financially immaterial acquisitions are part of our GSG segment. The total fair value of the purchase price for all 
four
 acquisitions was $
88.3
 million. This amount is comprised of $
44.0
 million in initial cash payments made to the sellers, $
2.5
 million of receivables (net) related to estimated post-closing adjustments for the net assets acquired, $
15.5
 million payable in a promissory note issued to the sellers along with related transaction expenses of the sellers (which were subsequently paid in July 2022) and $
31.3
 million for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, with a maximum of $
47.0
 million, based upon the achievement of specified operating income targets in each of the 
three
 to 
five years
 following the acquisitions. These acquisitions were not considered material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. As a result, no pro forma information has been provided.
The majority of the goodwill from fiscal 2024 and 2022 acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes, while the majority of the goodwill from the fiscal 2023 acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. The results of our acquisitions were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective closing dates.

In fiscal 2024, our goodwill additions from the LST and CCE acquisitions reflect the extensive technical knowledge of the acquired workforces, the anticipated synergies in data analytics, cybersecurity and digital transformation services, and collective reputations of these acquisitions in providing mission critical solutions to both commercial and government customers. In fiscal 2023, our goodwill additions are primarily attributable to the significant technical expertise residing in embedded workforces that are sought out by clients, synergies expected to arise after the acquisitions in the areas of enterprise technology services, data management, energy transformation, water, program management, and data analytics and the long-standing reputations of RPS and Amyx. These acquisitions further expand and complement our market-leading positions in water and environment; enhanced by a combined suite of differentiated data analytics and digital technologies, and expansion into existing and new geographies. The fiscal 2022 goodwill additions are primarily attributable to the significant technical expertise residing in embedded workforces that are sought out by clients, long-term management experience, the industry reputations and the synergies expected to arise after the acquisitions in the areas of data management, digitization, modeling, water and natural resources. In addition, these acquired capabilities, when combined with our existing global consulting and engineering business, result in opportunities that allow us to provide services under contracts that could not have been pursued individually by either us or the acquired companies. 
Intangible assets with finite lives arise from business acquisitions and are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets, ranging from 
one
 to 
12
 years. These consist of client relations, backlog and trade names. For detailed information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 
6
, “
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
”. 
Most of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out agreements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating income thresholds. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based on our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved. The fair values of any earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in “Current contingent earn-out liabilities” and “Non-current contingent earn-out liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former owners of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.
We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We use a probability-weighted discounted income approach as a valuation technique to convert future estimated cash flows to a single present value amount. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are operating income projections over the earn-out period (generally 
three
 or 
five years
) and the probability outcome percentages we assign to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
We review and reassess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities related to the time component of the present value calculation are reported in interest expen
se. Adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in operating income. In each quarter during fiscal 2024, we evaluated our estimates for contingent consideration liabilities for the remaining earn-out periods for each individual acquisition, which included a review of their financial results to-date, the status of ongoing projects in their RUPO and the inventory of prospective new contract awards. 
In fiscal 2024, we recorded adjustments to our contingent earn-out liabilities and reported a net loss to operating income of $
2.5
 million. The net loss primarily resulted from increased valuations of the contingent consideration liabilities for our prior acquisitions of LST and BlueWater Federal Solutions, Inc., reflecting their financial performance that exceeded our previous expectations. These increases were partially offset primarily by a decreased valuation of the contingent consideration for Amyx, as forecasted revenues and earnings did not become realized as originally anticipated. 
In fiscal 2023, we recorded adjustments to our contingent earn-out liabilities and reported a net loss to operating income of 
$
12.3
 million
. The net loss primarily resulted from increased valuations of the contingent consideration liabilities for our prior acquisitions of Segue Technologies, Inc., Hoare Lea, LLP ("HLE"), TIGA and PAE, reflecting their financial 
69
performance that exceeded our previous expectations. These increases were partially offset by a decreased valuation of the contingent consideration for Amyx. 
In fiscal 2022, total adjustments to our contingent earn-out liabilities in operating income were immaterial.

Goodwill amounts are presented net of reductions from historical impairment adjustments. The fiscal 2024 goodwill addition resulted from the purchase price allocations for our recent acquisitions which are preliminary and subject to adjustment based upon the final determinations of the net assets acquired and information to perform the final valuation. Goodwill adjustments primarily related to the foreign currency translation adjustments which resulted from our foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies that are different than our reporting currency. 
We per
form our annual goodwill impairment review at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter. Our last review at July 1, 2024 (i.e., the first day of our fourth quarter in fiscal 2024) indicated that we had 
no
 impairment of goodwill, and all of our reporting units had estimated fair values that were in excess of their carrying values, including goodwill. As of July 1, 2024, 
we had no reporting units that had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 
72
%. 
We also regularly evaluate whether events and c
ircumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential change in the recoverability of goodwill. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; an increase in the competitive environment; a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers; negative or declining cash flows; or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. Although we believe that our estimates of fair value for these reporting units are reasonable, if financial performance for these reporting units falls significantly below our expectations or market prices for similar business decline, the goodwill for these reporting units could become impaired. 
The gross amounts of goodwill for GSG were $
768.5
 million and $
677.6
 million at fiscal 2024 and 2023 year-ends, respectively, excluding accumulated impairment of $
17.7

Our foreign earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested and any potential tax liability that would be incurred upon repatriation is recognized currently with the related income. 
At September 29, 2024, we had available state net operating loss carry forwards of $
26.6
 million that expire at various dates from 2025 to 2043; and available foreign NOL carry forwards of $
123.9
 million, of which $
15.0
 million expire at various dates from 2025 to 2044, and $
108.9
 million have no expiration date. In addition, we had foreign capital loss carryforwards of $
41.4
 million, foreign corporate interest restriction allowances of $
7.5
 million, and foreign research and development credits of $
4.2
 million that do not have expiration dates. We have performed an assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, availability of carrybacks, cumulative losses in recent years, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized except for the deferred tax assets related to certain loss carry-forwards for which a valuation allowance of $
16.8
 million has been provided.
At September 29, 2024, we had $
41.4
 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions may not significantly decrease in the next 12 months.

On August 22, 2023, we issued $
575.0
 million in convertible notes that bear interest at a rate of 
2.25
% per annum payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2024 and mature on August 15, 2028, unless converted, redeemed or repurchased (the "Convertible Notes"). Prior to May 15, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. Thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
The initial conversion rate applicable to the Convertible Notes was 5.0855 shares (pre-stock split) of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial price of approximately $
196.64
 per share (pre-stock split) of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events, including stock splits and issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock. As adjusted to give effect to the stock split, the applicable conversion rate was 25.4345 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of approximately $
39.32
 per share of common stock) at September 29, 2024. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver
, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 
Convertible 
Notes being converted. In addition, upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" as defined in the indenture governing the 
Convertible 
Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 
Convertible 
Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 
Convertible 
Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. If certain corporate events occur prior to the maturity date of the 
Convertible 
Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 
Convertible 
Notes in connection with such event or notice of redemption.
We will not be able to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to August 20, 2026. On or after August 20, 2026, we have the option to redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes if the last reported sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than 
130
% of the conversion price for a specified period of time at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. In addition, as described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, certain events of default including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, may result in the Convertible Notes becoming due and payable immediately.

Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $
560.5
 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We used approximately $
51.8
 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. We used the remaining net proceeds to repay all $
185.0
 million principal amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility, the remaining $
234.4
 million principal amount outstanding under our senior secured term loan due 2027 and approximately $
89.4
 million principal amount outstanding under our senior secured term loan due 2026.
The Convertible Notes were recorded as a single unit within "Long-term debt" in our consolidated balance sheet as the conversion option within the Convertible Notes was not a derivative that would require bifurcation and the Convertible Notes did not involve a substantial premium. Transaction costs to issue the Convertible Notes were recorded as direct deductions from the related debt liabilities and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the Convertible Notes resulting in an effective annual interest rate of 
2.79
%.

Concurrent with the offering of the Convertible Notes, in August 2023, we entered into capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions"). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we elect to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions was initially $
259.56
 per share (pre-stock split), which represents a premium of 
65
% over the last reported sale price of our common stock of $
157.31
 per share (pre-stock split) on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on August 17, 2023. The cap price is subject to adjustment for certain events, including stock splits and issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock. As adjusted to give effect to the stock split, the adjusted cap price was approximately $
51.90
 per share at September 29, 2024. We recorded the Capped Call Transactions as separate transactions from the issuance of the Convertible Notes. The cost of $
51.8
 million incurred to purchase the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital (net of $
12.9
 million in deferred taxes) on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal 2023 year-end.
On October 26, 2022, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for an additional $
500
 million senior secured term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility") increasing our total borrowing capacity to $
1.55
 billion. On January 23, 2023, we drew the entire amount of the New Term Loan Facility to partially finance the RPS acquisition. The New Term Loan Facility is not subject to any amortization payments of principal and matures in January 2026.
On February 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”) with a total borrowing capacity of $
1.05
 billion that will mature in February 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement is a $
750
 million senior secured, 
five-year
 facility that provides for a $
250
 million term loan facility (the “Amended Term Loan Facility”) and a $
500
 million revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a $
300
 million accordion feature that allows us to increase the Amended Credit Agreement to $
1.05
 billion subject to lender approval. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) refinance indebtedness under our Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2018; (ii) finance open market repurchases of common stock, acquisitions, and cash dividends and distributions; and (iii) utilize the proceeds for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a reduction in the interest grid for meeting certain sustainability targets related to the (i) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the 
76
Company’s projects and operational sustainability initiatives and (ii) improvement of peoples’ lives as a result of the Company’s projects that provide environmental, social and governance benefits. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility includes a $
100
 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $
20
 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $
300
 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit.
The entire Amended Term Loan Facility was drawn on February 18, 2022. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a benchmark rate plus a margin that ranges from 
1.000
% to 
1.875
% per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus 
0.50
% per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate plus 
1.00
%,

plus a margin that ranges from 
0
% to 
0.875
% per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on February 18, 2027, or earlier at our discretion upon payment in full of loans and other obligations. In fiscal 2023, we repaid the Amended Term Loan Facility in full with the Convertible Notes proceeds.
At fiscal 2024 year-end, we had $
250
 million in outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, which was consisted of $
250
 million under the New Term Loan Facility and 
no
 borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement during fiscal 2024 was 
6.70
%. In addition, we had $
0.7
 million in standby letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement. At September 29, 2024, we had $
499.3
 million of available credit under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, all of which could be borrowed without a violation of our debt covenants. 
The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and restrictive covenants, and customary events of default. The financial covenants provide for a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 
3.25
 to 1.00 (total funded debt/EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 
3.00
 to 1.00 (EBITDA/Consolidated Interest Charges, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on (i) the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) the accounts receivable, general intangibles and intercompany loans and those of our subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers. At fiscal 2024 year-end, we were in compliance with these covenants with a consolidated leverage ratio of 
1.38
x and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 
13.94
x. 
In addition to the Amended Credit Agreement, we maintain other credit facilities, which may be used for short-term cash advances and bank guarantees. At fiscal 2024 year-end, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under these facilities and the aggregate amount of standby letters of credit outstanding was $
43.3
 million. As of September 29, 2024 we had 
no
 bank overdrafts related to our disbursement bank accounts.

Leases  
Our operating leases are primarily for corporate and project office spaces.
 To a much lesser extent, we have operating leases for vehicles and equipment. Our operating leases have remaining lease terms of 
one month
 to 
ten years
, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 
five years
. 
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are
 included in "Right-of-use assets, operating leases", "Short-term lease liabilities, operating leases" and "Long-term lease liabilities, operating leases"
 in the consolidated balance sheets. Our finance leases are primarily for certain IT equipment and are immaterial.
ROU
 assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease te
rm and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, incremental borrowing rates are used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments
. The operating lease ROU asset at the commencement date also includes any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and initial direct costs less lease incentives received. Lease te
rms may 
77
include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In fiscal 2023, we exited certain lease arrangements as a result of the RPS acquisition and its subsequent integration. Accordingly, we evaluated the ongoing value of the ROU assets associated with the discontinued lease agreements. Based on this evaluation, we determined that some long-lived assets were no longer recoverable and were in fact impaired.  Fair value was based on expected future cash flows using Level 3 inputs under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The cash flows are those expected to be generated by the market participants, discounted at a real estate-based rate of interest. As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a $
16.4
 million non-cash charge related to the ROU operating lease asset impairment which was reported in our fiscal 2023 statement of income, and a corresponding decrease to our ROU assets operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet at fiscal 2023 year-end.

Employee Benefits
In fiscal 2020, the Canadian federal government implemented the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy ("CEWS") program in response to the negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on businesses operating in Canada. Some of our Canadian legal entities qualified for and applied for these CEWS cash benefits to partially offset the impacts of revenue reductions and on-going staffing costs. 
The $
21
 million total received was initially recorded in "
Other long-term liabilities
" until all potential amendments to the qualification criteria, including some that were proposed with retroactive application, were finalized in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2024 (all in the first quarter of fiscal 2024), we distributed approximately $
10
 million
 to our Canadian employees. The remaining $
11
 million, which we expect to distribute in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, is reported in "
Accrued compensation
". We do not expect there will be any related impact on our operating income, and we have no outstanding applications for further government assistance.

Stockholders' Equity and Stock Compensation Plans
Stock Split.
    On September 9, 2024, we completed a 
five
-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.
At fiscal 2024 year-end, we had t
he following stock-based compensation plans:
•
2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("2015 EIP").
  Key employees and non-employee directors may be granted equity awards, including stock options, performance share units ("PSUs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares issued with respect to awards granted under the 2015 EIP other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, which are referred to as "full value awards", are counted against the 2015 EIP's aggregate share limit as 
three
 shares for every share or unit actually issued
. No awards have been made under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan since the adoption of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan on March 8, 2018 as described below. 
•
2018 Equity Incentive Plan ("2018 EIP")
. Key employees and non-employee directors may be granted equity awards, including stock options, PSUs and RSUs. Shares issued with respect to awards granted under the 2018 EIP other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, which are referred to as "full 
value awards", are counted against the 2018 EIP's aggregate share limit as one share for every share or unit issued. At fiscal 2024 year-end, there were 
12.8
 million shares available for future awards pursuant to the 2018 EIP.
•
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP").
  Purchase rights to purchase common stock are granted to our eligible full and part-time employees, and shares of common stock are issued upon exercise of the purchase rights. An aggregate of 
890,250
 shares may be issued pursuant to such exercise. The maximum amount that an employee can contribute during a purchase right period is $
5,000
. The exercise price of a purchase right i
s the lesser of 
100
% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the first day of the purchase right period (the business day preceding January 1) or 
85
% of the fair market value on the last day of the purchase right period (December 15, or the business day preceding December 15 if December 15 is not a business day).

No
 stock options were granted in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $

2.8
 million, $
0.6
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively.
RSU and PSU 
RSU awards are granted to our key employee and non-employee directors. The fair value of the RSU was determined at the date of grant using the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. All of the RSUs have time-based vesting over a 
four-year
 period, except that RSUs awarded to directors vest after 
one year
. The total compensation cost of the awards is then amortized over their applicable vesting period on a straight-line basis.
PSU awards are granted to our executive officers and non-employee directors. All of the PSUs are performance-based and vest, if at all, after the conclusion of the 
three-year
 performance period.  The number of PSUs that ultimately vest is based 
50
% on growth in our diluted EPS and 
50
% on our relative total shareholder return over the vesting period. For these performance-based awards, our expected performance is reviewed to estimate the percentage of shares that will vest. The total compensation cost of the awards is then amortized over their applicable vesting period on a straight-line basis.

 million, respectively. At fiscal 2024 year-end, ESPP participants had accumulated $
13
 million to purchase our common stock.

Retirement Plans
We have defined contribution plans in various countries where we have employees. Th
is primarily includes 401(k) plans in the United States. For fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, employer contributions to the U.S. plans were $
35.3
 million, $
31.6
 million and $
29.3
 million, respectively.
Additionally, we have established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees and non-employee directors. These eligible employees and non-employee directors may elect to defer the receipt of salary, incentive payments, restricted stock, PSU and RSU awards and non-employee director fees. The plan is accounted for in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested. Employee deferrals are deposited into a rabbi trust, and the funds are generally invested in individual variable life insurance contracts that we own and are specifically designed to informally fund savings plans of this nature. At fiscal 2024 and 2023 year-ends, the consolidated balance sheets reflect assets of $
70.1
 million and $
43.5
 million, respectively, related to the deferred compensation plan in "Other long-term assets," and liabilities of $
74.3
 million and $
43.4
 million, respectively, related to the deferred compensation plan in "Other long-term liabilities."  The net gains and losses related to the deferred compensation plan are reported as part of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of income. These related net gains and losses were immaterial for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
In connection with an acquisition, we assumed a defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”), which was operated for all qualifying employees. The assets of the Plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund. The plan is closed to new participants and to future benefit accrual. Under the agreed schedule of contributions, we make no further contributions, and continue to pay the expenses of administering the plan.
The change in the defined benefit obligation, the change in fair value of plan assets and the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial.

We seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status and obligations of each plan and typically employ both active and passive investment management strategies. The risk in our practices includes diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The target asset allocation selected for each plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to each plan’s liability structure and return goals.

Earnings per Share
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, less unvested restricted stock for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares for the period. Potential common shares include the weighted-average dilutive effects of stock-based awards and shares underlying our Convertible Notes.
For fiscal 2024, our Convertible Notes, described in Note 9, "Long-Term Debt", had a dilution impact on the dilutive potential common shares, which was calculated using the if-converted method. The dilution impact was due to the price of our common stock exceeding the conversion price. The related Capped Call Transactions were excluded from the calculation of dilutive potential common shares as their effect is anti-dilutive. For fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
no
 options were excluded from the calculation of dilutive potential common shares.
The following table presents the number of weighted-average shares used to compute basic and diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share data):

Derivative Financial Instruments 
We periodically use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our variable rate debt. We also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that cash flows and earnings could adversely be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our hedging program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives that have been designated as cash flow hedges in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income, and in our consolidated statements of income for those derivatives designated as fair value hedges.
 Our derivative contracts are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a forward contract to acquire GBP 
714.0
 million at a rate of 
1.0852
 for a total of USD $
774.8
 million that was integrated with our plan to acquire RPS. This contract matured on December 30, 2022. On December 28, 2022, we entered into an extension of the integrated forward contract to acquire GBP 
714.0
 million at a rate of 
1.086
 for a total of USD $
775.4
 million, extending the maturity date to January 23, 2023, the closing date of the RPS acquisition. Although an effective economic hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to this transaction, the forward contract did not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the forward contract was marked-to-market with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The intrinsic value of the forward contract was immaterial at inception as the GBP/USD spot and forward exchange rates were essentially the same. The fair value of the forward contract at October 2, 2022 was 
84
$
19.9
 million, and an unrealized gain of the same amount was recognized in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 results. On January 23, 2023, the forward contract was settled at the fair value of $
109.3
 million. We recognized additional gains of $
68.0
 million and $
21.4
 million in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. All gains related to this transaction were reported in “Other non-operating income" on our consolidated income statements for the respective periods.
In fiscal 2018, we entered
 into 
five
 interest rate swap agreements that we designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rates on the borrowings under our term loan facility. The five swaps expired on July 31, 2023. At fiscal 2022 year-end, the fair value of the effective portion of our interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges before tax effect was an unrealized gain of $
2.4
 million, which was reported in "Other non-current assets" on our consolidated balance sheet. 
Additionally, the related loss of $
2.4
 million and a gain of $
11.8
 million for fiscal yea
r ended 2023 and 2022, respectively, were recognized and reported on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There were no derivative instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Fair Value Measurements
We classified our assets and liabilities that were carried at fair value in one of the following categories:
•
Level 1:  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2:  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
•
Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
Derivative Instruments.
     Our derivative instruments are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For additional information about our derivative financial instruments (see Note 2, "Basis of Presentation" and Note 15, "Derivative Financial Instruments").
85
Contingent Consideration.
    We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 2, "Basis of Presentation" and Note 5, "Acquisitions" for further information).
Debt.
    The fair value of long-t
erm debt under our Credit Facility was determined using the present value of future cash flows based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 measurement). The carrying value of our long-term debt under our Credit Facility approximated fair value at the end of our fiscal 2024 and 2023.
 At fiscal 2024 year-end, we had $
250
 million in outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement, which consisted of $
250
 million under the New Term Loan Facility and 
no
 borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. 
The estimated fair value of our $
575
 million Convertible Notes, which were used to fund our business acquisitions, working capital needs, dividends, capital expenditures and contingent earn-outs, was determined based on the trading price of the Convertible Notes as of the last trading day of fiscal 2024. We consider the fair value of the Convertible Notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Convertible Notes were approximately $
564
 million and $
743
 million, respectively, at September 29, 2024, and $
561
 million and $
566
 million, respectively, at October 1, 2023 (see Note 
9
, "
Long-Term Debt
").
Defined Benefit Pension Plan.
    The fair values of the plan assets are primarily categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For additional information 
about our defined benefit pension plan (see 
Note 13, "
Retirement Plans
").

18.         
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to certain claims and lawsuits typically filed against the consulting and engineering profession, alleging primarily professional errors or omissions. We carry professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, against such claims. However, in some actions, parties are seeking damages that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured. While management does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect, individually or in aggregate, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, management acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of these matters.
On July 15, 2019, following an initial January 14, 2019 filing, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office ("the USAO") filed an amended complaint in the intervention of 
three
 qui tam actions filed against our subsidiary, Tetra Tech EC, Inc. ("TtEC"), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ("the Court"). The complaint alleges False Claims Act violations and breach of contract related to TtEC's contracts to perform environmental remediation services at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. On March 5, 2024, the Court granted the USAO's motion to amend the filing to include additional claims against TtEC under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and common law. Several ancillary claims brought by third-party private plaintiffs arising from the same services provided by TtEC at Hunters Point are also ongoing. To explore whether a negotiated resolution is possible, TtEC began engaging in discussions with the USAO subsequent to the end of fiscal 2024 regarding a potential resolution of all claims. There can be no assurance that any framework for resolution will be achieved and, if any settlement is achieved, what the final terms or dollar amount will be. If a settlement is achieved, TtEC would not admit any wrongdoing and would be settling to avoid the delay, uncertainty and expense of protracted litigation. It is reasonably possible that a charge to income, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, may be required in future periods as discussions with the USAO continue and additional information becomes available.
19.         
Reportable Segments
We manage ou
r operations under 
two
 reportable segments. Our GSG reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and all activities with development agencies worldwide. Our CIG reporta
ble segment primarily includes activities with U.S. commercial clients and international clients other than development agencies. 
Our reportable segments are described as follows:
GSG:
    GSG provides high-end consulting and engineering services primarily to U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and international development agencies worldwide. GSG supports U.S. government civilian and defense agencies with services in water, environment, sustainable infrastructure, information technology and disaster management. GSG also provides engineering design services for U.S. based federal and municipal clients, especially in water infrastructure, flood protection and solid waste. GSG also leads our support for development agencies worldwide, especially in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.
CIG:

CIG primarily provides high-end consulting and engineering services to U.S. commercial clients, and international clients inclusive of the commercial and government sectors. CIG supports commercial clients worldwide in renewable energy, industrial, high-performance buildings and aerospace markets. CIG also provides sustainable infrastructure and related environmental, engineering and project management services to commercial and local government clients across 
86
Canada, in Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and New Zealand), Europe, the United Kingdom and South America (primarily Brazil).
Management eva
luates the performance of these reportable segments based upon their respective segment operating income before the effect of amortization expense related to acquisitions, and other unallocated corporate expenses. We account for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if they were to third parties; that is, by applying a negotiated fee
 onto the costs of the services performed. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In fiscal 2023, our Corporate segment operating losses included $
33.2
 million of acquisition and integration expenses as described in Note 5, "Acquisitions". 
We also recorded a $
16.4
 million ($
6.8
 million in GSG, $
8.3
 million in CIG and $
1.3
 million in Corporate) non-cash impairment charge related to our ROU operating lease assets in fiscal 2023 (see Note 10, "Leases" for more information).

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and changes in internal control over financial reporting
At September 29, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
. Based on our management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our 
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), were effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal controls include those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 29, 2024, based on the criteria in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO. Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at September 29, 2024.
Pricewaterhouse
Coopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report, dated November 19, 2024, appears on pages 51-52 of this F
orm 10-K.
Consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff, management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting excluded LS Technologies ("LST"), which we acquired on January 31, 2024. LST is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
 that occurred during the three months ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
