ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Note 18 “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” included within the notes to our consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to any litigation or legal proceeding that, in the current opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings, actual results could differ from current expected results.

ITEM 5.
MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
Market Information
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “HURN.” As of February 18, 2025, there were 298 registered holders of record of Huron’s common stock. A number of Huron’s stockholders hold their shares in street name; therefore, the Company believes that there are substantially more beneficial owners of its common stock.
Dividends
We have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since we became a public company. Our board of directors re-evaluates this policy periodically. Any determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, terms of our financing arrangements, and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. In addition, the amount of dividends we may pay is subject to the restricted payment provisions of our senior secured credit facility. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section under Part II—Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information on the restricted payment provisions of our senior secured credit facility.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
The information required by this item appears under Part III—Item 12. “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholders Matters.”
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
On December 2, 2024, as partial consideration for our acquisition of AXIA Consulting, we issued 98,156 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, with an aggregate value of $12.2 million. The issuance was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.
Our Stock Ownership Participation Program and 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy individual tax withholding requirements. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we reacquired 5,614 shares of common stock with a weighted average fair market value of $111.81 as a result of such tax withholdings. 
In November 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2021. The share repurchase program has been subsequently extended and increased, most recently in the second quarter of 2024. The current authorization extends the share repurchase program through December 31, 2025 with a repurchase amount of $500 million, of which $
64.5
 million remained available as of December 31, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases under the share repurchase program were and will continue to be determined by management and depend on a variety of factors, including the trading price of our common stock, capacity under our credit facility, general market and business conditions, and applicable legal requirements.

OVERVIEW
Huron is a global professional services firm that partners with clients to put possible into practice by creating sound strategies, optimizing operations, accelerating digital transformation, and empowering businesses to own their future. By embracing diverse perspectives, encouraging new ideas and challenging the status quo, we create sustainable results for the organizations we serve.
We provide our services and products and manage our business under three operating segments: Healthcare, Education and Commercial. We also provide revenue reporting across two principal capabilities: i) Consulting and Managed Services and ii) Digital. See Part I—Item 1. “Business—Overview—Our Services” and Note 19 “Segment Information” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our segments and capabilities.
COMPONENTS OF OPERATING RESULTS
Total Revenues
Revenues before Reimbursable Expenses
Revenues before reimbursable expenses are primarily generated by our employees who provide consulting and other professional services to our clients and are billable to our clients based on the number of hours worked, services provided, or achieved outcomes. We refer to these employees as our revenue-generating professionals. Revenues before reimbursable expenses are primarily driven by the number of revenue-generating professionals we employ as well as the total value, scope, and terms of the consulting contracts under which they provide services. We also engage independent contractors to supplement our revenue-generating professionals on client engagements as needed.
We generate our revenues before reimbursable expenses from providing professional services and software products under the following four types of billing arrangements: fixed-fee (including software license revenue); time-and-expense; performance-based; and software support, maintenance and subscriptions.
•
Fixed-fee (including software license revenue):
 In fixed-fee billing arrangements, we agree to a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. We set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the engagements. Fixed-fee arrangements also include software licenses for our research administration and compliance software. 
•
Time-and-expense:
 Under time-and-expense billing arrangements, we invoice our clients based on the number of hours worked by our revenue-generating professionals at agreed upon rates. Time-and-expense arrangements also include speaking engagements, conferences and publications purchased by our clients.  
•
Performance-based:
 In performance-based billing arrangements, fees are tied to the attainment of contractually defined objectives. We enter into performance-based engagements in essentially two forms. First, we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving operational and cost effectiveness in the areas we review. Second, we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. Often, performance-based fees supplement our fixed-fee or time-and-expense engagements. The level of performance-based fees earned may vary based on our clients’ risk sharing preferences and the mix of services we provide.
•
Software support, maintenance and subscriptions:
 Clients that have purchased one of our software licenses can pay an annual fee for software support and maintenance. We also generate subscription revenue from our cloud-based analytic tools and solutions including our cloud-based revenue cycle management software and research administration and compliance software. Software support, maintenance and subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the support or subscription period. These fees are generally billed in advance and included in deferred revenues until recognized.
21
Table of Contents

Time-and-expense engagements do not provide us with a high degree of predictability as to performance in future periods. Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in utilization and revenues and present a challenge to optimal hiring and staffing. Moreover, our clients typically retain us on an engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under long-term recurring contracts. The volume of work performed for any particular client can vary widely from period to period.
Our quarterly results are impacted principally by the total value, scope, and terms of our client contracts, the number of our revenue-generating professionals who are available to work, our revenue-generating professionals' utilization rate, and the bill rates we charge our clients. Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate. Our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients. For example, during the third and fourth quarters of the year, vacations taken by our clients can result in the deferral of activity on existing and new engagements, which would negatively affect our utilization rate. The number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter. We typically have fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period.
Reimbursable Expenses
Reimbursable expenses that are billed to clients, primarily relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements, are included in total revenues. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that we bill to our clients at cost.
Operating Expenses
Our most significant expenses are costs classified as direct costs. Direct costs primarily consist of compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals, which includes salaries, performance bonuses, share-based compensation, signing and retention bonuses, payroll taxes and benefits. Direct costs also include fees paid to independent contractors that we retain to supplement our revenue-generating professionals, typically on an as-needed basis for specific client engagements, and technology costs, product and event costs, and commissions. Direct costs exclude amortization of intangible assets and software development costs and reimbursable expenses, both of which are separately presented in our consolidated statements of operations.
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs for our support personnel, which includes salaries, performance bonuses, share-based compensation, signing and retention bonuses, payroll taxes, benefits and deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability. Changes in the market value of our deferred compensation liability are offset with the changes in market value of investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability, which are recorded within other income (expense), net. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are third-party professional fees, software licenses and data hosting expenses, rent and other office related expenses, sales and marketing related expenses, recruiting and training expenses, and practice administration and meetings expenses. 
Other operating expenses include restructuring charges, other gains and losses, depreciation expense, and amortization expense related to internally developed software costs and intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Segment Results
Segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment, less operating expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated corporate expenses not allocated at the segment level include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner, as well as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense that are not attributable to a particular segment. The administrative function costs include corporate office support costs, office facility costs, costs related to accounting and finance, human resources, legal, marketing, information technology, and company-wide business development functions, and costs related to overall corporate management.
Non-GAAP Measures
We also assess our results of operations using the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP because they exclude a number of items required by GAAP, each discussed below. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows, or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define our non-GAAP financial measures.
Our management uses the non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance, for example when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their 
22
Table of Contents

financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing our business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results.
These non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for the following items:
Amortization of intangible assets:
 We exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets from the calculation of adjusted net income, as it is inconsistent in its amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions.
Restructuring charges:
 We have incurred charges due to restructuring various parts of our business. These restructuring charges have primarily consisted of costs associated with office space consolidations, including lease impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on lease-related property and equipment, and employee severance charges. We exclude the effect of the restructuring charges from our non-GAAP measures to permit comparability with periods that were not impacted by these items. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our restructuring charges. 
2024 litigation settlement gain:
 In the second quarter of 2024, we settled a litigation matter in which Huron was the plaintiff for $15.0 million, on a pre-tax basis. This $15.0 million settlement gain was recorded as a component of other gains, net on our consolidated statement of operations. We have excluded from our non-GAAP measures $11.7 million, which is the value of the settlement gain that exceeds the third-party legal costs of $3.3 million incurred during 2024 specific to this litigation matter, as this net gain is not indicative of the ongoing performance of our business. Third-party legal costs incurred for this litigation matter in 2023 and 2022 were $4.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Our third-party legal expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on our statement of operations.
Other losses (gains), net:
 We exclude the effects of other losses and gains, which primarily relate to changes in the estimated fair value of our liabilities for contingent consideration related to business acquisitions and litigation settlement losses and gains, excluding the 2024 litigation settlement gain presented separately, to permit comparability with periods that are not impacted by these items. These items are recorded as a component of other gains, net on our consolidated statement of operations.
Transaction-related expenses
: To permit comparability with prior periods, we exclude the impact of third-party advisory, legal, and accounting fees and other corporate costs incurred directly related to the evaluation and/or consummation of business acquisitions.
Unrealized losses (gains) on preferred stock investment:
 We exclude the effect of unrealized losses and gains related to changes in the fair value of our preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company arising from observable price changes or impairment losses. These unrealized losses and gains are included as a component of other income (expense), net. We believe that these unrealized losses and gains are not indicative of the ongoing performance of our business and their exclusion permits comparability with prior periods. 
Losses (gains) on sale of business: 
We exclude the effect of non-operating losses and gains recognized as a result of sales of businesses as they are infrequent, management believes that these items are not indicative of the ongoing performance of our business, and their exclusion permits comparability with periods that were not impacted by such items. The 2024 gain relates to the divestiture of our Studer Education practice in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Foreign currency transaction losses (gains), net:
 We exclude the effect of foreign currency transaction losses and gains from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA because the amount of each loss or gain is significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
Tax effect of adjustments:
 The non-GAAP income tax adjustment reflects the incremental tax impact applicable to the non-GAAP adjustments.
Income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization:
 We exclude the effects of income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, and depreciation and amortization in the calculation of EBITDA, as these are customary exclusions as defined by the calculation of EBITDA to arrive at meaningful earnings from core operations excluding the effect of such items. We include, within the depreciation and amortization adjustment, the amortization of capitalized implementation costs of our ERP and other related software, which is included within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Revenue-Generating Professionals
Our revenue-generating professionals consist of our full-time consultants who generate revenues based on the number of hours worked; full-time equivalents, which consists of coaches and their support staff within the culture and organizational excellence solution, consultants who work variable schedules as needed by clients, and full-time employees who provide software support and maintenance services to clients; 
23
Table of Contents

and our Managed Services professionals who provide revenue cycle management and research administration managed services and outsourcing at our healthcare, education and research-focused clients.
Utilization Rate
The utilization rate of our revenue-generating professionals is calculated by dividing the number of hours our billable consultants worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for these billable consultants during the same period. Available working hours are determined by the standard hours worked by each billable consultant, adjusted for part-time hours, and U.S. standard work weeks. Available working hours exclude local country holidays and vacation days. Utilization rates are presented for our revenue-generating professionals who primarily bill on an hourly basis. We do not present utilization rates for our Managed Services professionals as most of the revenues generated by these employees are not billed on an hourly basis.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Highlights
Highlights from the year ended December 31, 2024 include the following:
•
Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 9.1% to $1.49 billion in 2024 from $1.36 billion in 2023.
•
Net income as a percentage of total revenues increased to 7.7% in 2024, compared to 4.5% in 2023.

•
Diluted EPS increased 96.6% to $6.27 for 2024, compared to $3.19 for 2023.

•
Adjusted diluted EPS increased 31.8% to $6.47 for 2024, compared to $4.91 for 2023.
•
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 48.8% to $201.3 million for 2024, compared to $135.3 million for 2023.
•
Returned $122.2 million shareholders by repurchasing 1,218,434 shares of our common stock in 2024.
Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased $124.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The overall increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses reflects continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within our Healthcare and Education segments, and reflects our focus on accelerating growth in our healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities. 
Revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Consulting and Managed Services capability increased 10.5% to $863.9 million in 2024, compared to $782.0 million in 2023; and reflected strengthened demand in our Healthcare and Education segments, partially offset by a decrease in demand in our Commercial segment. The utilization rate within our Consulting capability decreased to 73.6% in 2024, compared to 76.6% in 2023.
Revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Digital capability increased 7.3% to $622.2 million in 2024, compared to $580.0 million in 2023; and reflected strengthened demand in our Healthcare and Education segments, partially offset by a decrease in demand in our Commercial segment. The utilization rate within our Digital capability increased to 76.0% in 2024, compared to 75.3% in 2023. 
Our total number of revenue-generating professionals, excluding Managed Services professionals, increased 5.0% to 4,694 as of December 31, 2024, compared to 4,469 as of December 31, 2023, as a result of hiring to support the overall increase in demand for our services. The number of Managed Services professionals increased 45.7% to 1,530 as of December 31, 2024 from 1,050 as of December 31, 2023. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services as employee compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
Net income increased $54.1 million, or 86.7%, to $116.6 million, or 7.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $62.5 million, or 4.5% of total revenues, for the same period last year. Results for 2024 include an $11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Results for 2023 include a non-cash impairment loss of $19.4 million, net of tax, related to our investment in a hospital-at-home company. As a result of the increase in net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan, diluted earnings per share increased 96.6% to $6.27 for 2024, compared to $3.19 for 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the litigation settlement gain in 2024 and the non-cash impairment loss on our investment in 2023, increased 31.8% to $6.47 for 2024 from $4.91 for 2023.

Table of Contents

Adjusted EBITDA increased $33.8 million, or 20.2%, to $201.2 million, or 13.5% of revenues before reimbursable expenses, in 2024, compared to $167.3 million, or 12.3% of revenues before reimbursable expenses, in 2023. 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 48.8% to $201.3 million in 2024, compared to $135.3 million in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily related to an increase in cash collections in 2024, a $15 million litigation settlement received in 2024, and a decrease in payments for contractor expenses in 2024 compared to 2023; partially offset by an increase in payments for salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, an increase in the amount paid for annual performance bonuses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, and an increase in payments for selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024 compared to the prior year.
During 2024, we deployed $122.2 million of capital to repurchase 1,218,434 shares of our common stock, representing 6.6% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased $124.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The overall increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses reflects continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within our Healthcare and Education segments, and reflects our focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for our Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities within our Commercial segment. Additional information on our revenues before reimbursable expense by segment follows.

Table of Contents

•
Healthcare
 revenues before reimbursable expenses increased $82.3 million, or 12.2%, driven by continued strength in demand for our performance improvement, revenue cycle managed services, culture and organizational excellence and strategy and innovation solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability and our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for our financial and capital advisory solution within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. Revenues before reimbursable expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 included $0.6 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of Roundtable Analytics completed in September 2023.
On December 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our Studer Education practice within our Healthcare segment. This business generated revenues before reimbursable expenses of $13.7 million and $12.3 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Studer Education practice was not significant to our consolidated financial statements and did not qualify as a discontinued operation for reporting under GAAP.
The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Healthcare segment, excluding Managed Services professionals, grew 8.2% to 1,218 as of December 31, 2024, compared to 1,126 as of December 31, 2023.
•
Education
 revenues before reimbursable expenses increased $44.6 million, or 10.4%, and includes $18.6 million of incremental revenues from our acquisition of Grenzebach Glier and Associates, Inc. (“GG+A”) completed in March 2024. The increase in Education revenues before reimbursable expenses was also driven by continued strength in demand for our technology and analytics services and software products within our Digital capability and our strategy and operations solution within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. 
The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Education segment, excluding Managed Services professionals, grew 5.6% to 1,141 as of December 31, 2024, compared to 1,080 as of December 31, 2023. Our acquisition of GG+A in March 2024 added approximately 70 revenue-generating professionals.
•
Commercial
 revenues before reimbursable expenses decreased $2.8 million, or 1.1%. Revenues before reimbursable expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 included $3.1 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of AXIA Consulting, Inc. (“AXIA Consulting”), which was completed in December 2024. The decrease in revenues before reimbursable expenses was primarily due to the decreases in demand for our strategy and innovation solution within our Consulting and Managed Services capability and our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability, partially offset by an increase in demand for our financial advisory solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. 
The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Commercial segment, the majority of which provide services across all of our industries, grew 3.2% to 2,335 as of December 31, 2024, compared to 2,263 as of December 31, 2023, including our acquisition of AXIA Consulting in December 2024 which added approximately 130 revenue-generating professionals.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $79.6 million, or 6.2%, over the year ended December 31, 2023.

Direct Costs
Direct costs increased $67.4 million, or 7.1%, to $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $942.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $67.4 million increase primarily related to a $79.1 million increase in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and a $4.0 million increase in technology costs, partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease in contractor expenses. The $79.1 million increase in compensation costs reflects our investment to grow our talented team to meet increased market demand and is primarily attributable to a $76.7 million increase in salaries and related expenses driven by increased headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024 and a $5.5 million increase in performance bonus expense; partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, direct costs decreased to 68.0% during 2024, compared to 69.2% during 2023, primarily attributable to the decrease in contractor expenses and revenue growth that outpaced the increase in performance bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals; partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses.
Reimbursable Expenses
Reimbursable expenses are billed to clients at cost and primarily relate to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements. These expenses are also included in total revenues. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that are also included as a component of operating expenses. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28.7 million, or 11.1%, to $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $257.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $28.7 million increase primarily related to a $16.1 million increase in non-payroll costs, driven by a $5.9 million increase in software and data hosting expenses, a $3.3 million increase in practice administration and meetings expenses, a $2.7 million increase in bad debt expense, and a $1.3 million increase in promotion and marketing expenses, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in training expenses. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.7 million due to an increase in compensation costs for our support personnel driven by a $14.5 million increase in salaries and related expenses and a $1.2 million increase in performance bonus expense; partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a $1.2 million decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19.3% during 2024, compared to 18.9% during 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and related expenses for our support personnel and software and data hosting expenses, as percentages of revenues before reimbursable expenses; partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense for our support personnel.
Other Gains, Net
Other gains, net totaled $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $14.2 million of other gains, net for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of a pre-tax $15.0 million litigation settlement gain for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff and $0.5 million of net remeasurement gains to decrease the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations. The $0.4 million of other gains, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of net remeasurement gains to decrease the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations.
See Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.
Restructuring Charges
Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $9.9 million, compared to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. During 2024, we exited our office space previously occupied by GG+A and a portion of our office space in New York, New York resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, on the related right-of-use operating lease assets and fixed assets. Additionally, we exited the remaining portion of our office space in Denver, Colorado resulting in $0.5 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization on the related fixed assets and right-of-use operating lease assets we abandoned. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed the divestiture of our Studer Education practice and incurred $1.3 million of restructuring charges, consisting of $1.0 million of transaction-related employee payments and $0.3 million of third-party legal and professional advisory fees. Restructuring charges incurred in 2024 also included $2.3 million of severance-related expenses unrelated to the divestiture; $2.3 million of rent and related expenses, net of sublease income, for previously vacated office spaces; and $0.8 million related to non-cash lease impairment charges driven by updated sublease assumptions for our previously vacated office spaces.

Table of Contents

During 2023, we exited our office spaces in Hillsboro, Oregon and Lexington, Massachusetts, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $1.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, on the related right-of-use operating lease assets and fixed assets. Additionally, restructuring charges incurred in 2023 included $3.0 million of severance-related expenses; $1.8 million for rent and related expenses, net of sublease income, for previously vacated office spaces; $0.9 million related to non-cash lease impairment charges driven by updated sublease assumptions for previously vacated office spaces; and $0.3 million related to the abandonment of a capitalized software development project.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.1 million, or 0.3%, to $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, largely offset by an increase in amortization of internally developed software.
Operating Income
Operating income increased $43.5 million to $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating margin, which is defined as operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, increased to 11.4% for 2024, compared to 9.2% for 2023.

Healthcare
 operating income increased $36.0 million, or 20.8%, primarily due to the increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses and a decrease in contractor expenses; partially offset by increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals, practice administration and meetings expenses, technology costs, bad debt expense, and promotion and marketing expenses. The increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals were primarily driven by an increase in headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024, an increase in performance bonus expense, and an increase in share-based compensation expenses; partially offset by a decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense. Healthcare operating margin increased to 27.6% from 25.7% primarily due to the decrease in contractor expenses; partially offset by an increase in practice administration and meetings expenses, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses.
•
Education
 operating income increased $9.4 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to the increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses as well as decreases in training expenses and contractor expenses; partially offset by increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and support personnel and amortization of capitalized software development costs. The increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and support personnel were primarily driven by an increase in headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024; partially offset by decreases in performance bonus expense and share-based compensation expense for our revenue-generating professionals. The increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs primarily relates to the redesign of Huron Research Suite that successfully went live in 2024 and reflects our focus on advancing our Education software products. Education operating margin decreased to 22.9% from 23.1% primarily driven by an increase in salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses; partially offset by the decrease in performance bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals.
•
Commercial
 operating income decreased $3.0 million, or 5.5%, primarily due to the decrease in revenues before reimbursable expenses as well as increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and software and data hosting expenses; partially offset by decreases in promotion and marketing expenses and restructuring charges. The increase in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals was primarily driven by annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in headcount due to the acquisition of AXIA Consulting in the fourth quarter of 2024; partially offset by decreases in signing, retention and other bonus expense and performance bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals.

Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest expense, net of interest income increased $5.8 million to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily attributable to higher levels of borrowing and higher interest rates under our Amended Credit Facility in 2024 compared to 2023. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 7 “Financing Arrangements” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our senior secured credit facility.
Other income (expense), net increased $32.4 million to income of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from expense of $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2024, we recognized a $4.6 million gain for the market value of our investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability, a $3.6 million gain related to the divestiture of our Studer Education practice, and $2.1 million of foreign currency transaction gains. In 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $26.3 million on our preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company and $0.5 million of foreign currency transaction losses, which were partially offset by a $4.8 million gain for the market value of our investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability. The gains recognized in 2024 and 2023 related to the market value of our investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability were offset with deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in the market value of our deferred compensation liability which is recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 "Acquisitions and Divestitures" within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the divestiture completed in 2024, Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our preferred stock investment, and Note 15 “Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our deferred compensation plan.
Income Tax Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate was 24.3% as we recognized income tax expense of $37.4 million on income of $154.0 million. The effective tax rate of 24.3% was more favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.0%, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit for share-based compensation awards that vested during the year. This favorable item was partially offset by certain nondeductible expense items.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, our effective tax rate was 25.5% as we recognized income tax expense of $21.4 million on income of $83.9 million. The effective tax rate of 25.5% was more favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.2%, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit for share-based compensation awards that vested during the year and the positive impact of certain federal tax credits. These favorable items were partially offset by certain nondeductible expense items.
See Note 17 “Income Taxes” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our income tax expense.
Net Income and Earnings per Share
Net income increased $54.1 million to $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes the $11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a non-cash impairment loss of $19.4 million, net of tax, related to our preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased to $6.27, compared to $3.19 for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the increase in net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan. The 2024 litigation settlement gain related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff had a favorable impact of $0.60 on diluted earnings per share in 2024, while the 2023 change in fair value of our preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company had an unfavorable impact on our diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in 2023. 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA increased $75.9 million to $205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in EBITDA was attributable to the increases in Healthcare and Education operating income, excluding segment depreciation and amortization; the $26.3 million non-cash impairment loss related to our preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company recognized in 2023; and the pre-tax $15.0 million litigation settlement gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 for a

completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. These increases to EBITDA were partially offset by the increase in unallocated corporate expenses, excluding the impact of the change in the market value of our deferred compensation liability.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $33.8 million to $201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $167.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increases in Healthcare and Education operating income, excluding the impact of segment depreciation and amortization and segment restructuring charges; partially offset by the increase in unallocated corporate expenses, excluding the impacts of the change in the market value of our deferred compensation liability and transaction-related expenses. 
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share
Adjusted net income increased $24.2 million to $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $6.47 in 2024, compared to $4.91 in 2023, driven by the increase in adjusted net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and cash equivalents were $21.9 million, $12.1 million, and $11.8 million at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from our U.S. operations, and borrowing capacity available under our credit facility.

Operating Activities
Our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, operating lease obligations and deferred revenues. The volume of services rendered and the related billings and timing of collections on those billings, as well as payments of our accounts payable and salaries, bonuses, and related benefits to employees affect these account balances. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for software and other information technology products to support our business and corporate infrastructure.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $66.1 million to $201.3 million in 2024 from $135.3 million in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily related to an increase in cash collections in 2024, a $15 million litigation settlement received in 2024 for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff, and a decrease in payments for contractor expenses in 2024 compared to 2023; partially offset by an increase in payments for salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, an increase in the amount paid for annual performance bonuses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, and an increase in payments for selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024 compared to the prior year.
Investing Activities
Our investing activities primarily consist of purchases of complementary businesses; purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to computers and related equipment for our employees and leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for office spaces; payments related to internally developed cloud-based software sold to our clients; and investments. Our investments include a convertible note investment in Shorelight Holdings, LLC, a preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company, and investments in life insurance policies that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability.    
Net cash used in investing activities was $79.7 million for 2024 which primarily consisted of $49.5 million for purchases of businesses; $23.9 million for payments related to internally developed software to advance our Healthcare and Education software products; $8.7 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to purchases of computers and related equipment and leasehold improvements for certain office spaces; and $2.6 million for contributions to our life insurance policies. These uses of cash for investing activities were partially offset by $4.7 million of cash received related to the divestiture of our Studer Education practice in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Net cash used in investing activities was $36.7 million for 2023 which primarily consisted of $25.7 million for payments related to internally developed software to advance our Healthcare and Education software products; $9.4 million for purchases of property and equipment,

primarily related to purchases of computers and related equipment and leasehold improvements for certain office spaces; $3.1 million for contributions to our life insurance policies; and $1.6 million for the purchase of a business. These uses of cash for investing activities were partially offset by $3.0 million of cash received for distributions from our life insurance policies that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability.
We estimate that cash utilized for purchases of property and equipment and software development in 2025 will total approximately $35 million to $40 million; primarily consisting of software development costs, information technology-related equipment to support our corporate infrastructure, and leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for certain office locations
Financing Activities
Our financing activities primarily consist of borrowings and repayments under our senior secured credit facility, share repurchases, shares redeemed for employee tax withholdings upon vesting of share-based compensation, and payments for contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions. See “Financing Arrangements” below for additional information on our senior secured credit facility.
Net cash used in financing activities was $111.6 million in 2024. During 2024, we borrowed $743.5 million and made repayments on our borrowings of $709.8 million. The borrowings and repayments during 2024 include the $275.0 million Term Loan proceeds which were used to repay borrowings under the Revolver in the first quarter of 2024. The net borrowings of $33.7 million were primarily used to fund our operations, including our annual performance bonus payments in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, during 2024, we paid $123.0 million for the settlement of share repurchases and we reacquired $22.1 million of common stock as a result of tax withholdings upon vesting of share-based compensation. We also made payments of $1.4 million for debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. These uses of cash for financing activities were partially offset by $1.8 million of cash received from stock option exercises in 2024. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $98.3 million in 2023. During 2023, we borrowed $354.0 million primarily to fund our operations, including our annual performance bonus payments in the first quarter of 2023,and made repayments on our borrowings of $320.0 million. Additionally, in 2023, we paid $122.8 million for the settlement of share repurchases and we reacquired $10.5 million of common stock as a result of tax withholdings upon vesting of share-based compensation. We also made deferred acquisition payments of $1.5 million to the sellers of certain businesses we acquired. These payments were primarily the result of achieving specified financial performance targets in accordance with the related purchase agreements. These uses of cash for financing activities were partially offset by $2.5 million of cash received from stock option exercises in 2023.
Share Repurchase Program
In November 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2021. The share repurchase program has been subsequently extended and increased, most recently in the second quarter of 2024. The current authorization extends the share repurchase program through December 31, 2025 with a repurchase amount of $500 million, of which $64.5 million remains available as of December 31, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases under the share repurchase program were and will continue to be determined by management and depend on a variety of factors, including the trading price of our common stock, capacity under our credit facility, general market and business conditions, and applicable legal requirements. 
Financing Arrangements
At December 31, 2024, we had $357.7 million outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement, as discussed below.
The Company has a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $275 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), subject to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 15, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), both of which fully mature on November 15, 2027. The Term Loan was established in February 2024 with the execution of Amendment No. 2 to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments of $3.4 million which began June 30, 2024 and continue through the maturity date of November 15, 2027, at which time the outstanding principal balance and all accrued interest will be due.
Fees and interest on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement vary based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). At our option, these borrowings will bear interest at one, three or six month Term SOFR or, in the case of the Revolver, an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate between 1.125% per annum and 1.875% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings, or between 0.125% per annum and 0.875% per annum, in the case of base rate loans, based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The applicable margin for the outstanding principal under the Term Loan will range between 1.625% per annum and 2.375% per annum based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The fees and interest are subject to further adjustment based upon the Company's performance against specified key performance indicators. Based upon the performance of the Company against those key performance indicators in each Reference Year (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), certain adjustments to the otherwise applicable rates for interest, 
34
Table of Contents

commitment fees and letter of credit fees will be made. These annual adjustments will not exceed an increase or decrease of 0.01% in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the commitment fee rate or an increase or decrease of 0.05% in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the Term SOFR borrowings, base rate borrowings or letter of credit fee rate.
Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to prepay the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement in certain circumstances, including upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). In addition, we have the right to permanently reduce or terminate the unused portion of the commitments provided under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties; affirmative and negative covenants, which include limitations on liens, investments, additional indebtedness, and restricted payments; and two quarterly financial covenants as follows: (i) a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA) of 3.75 to 1.00; however, the maximum permitted Consolidated Leverage Ratio will increase to 4.25 to 1.00 upon the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), and (ii) a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest) of 3.00 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the financial covenants is calculated on a continuing operations basis and includes adjustments to add back non-cash goodwill impairment charges, share-based compensation costs, certain non-cash restructuring charges, pro forma historical EBITDA for businesses acquired, and other specified items in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. For purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, total debt is on a gross basis and is not netted against our cash balances. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Our Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of December 31, 2024 was 1.39 to 1.00, compared to 1.59 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2023. Our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio as of December 31, 2024 was 10.50 to 1.00, compared to 10.85 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2023. 
The Amended Credit Agreement contains restricted payment provisions, including a potential limit on the amount of dividends we may pay. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.50, the amount of dividends and other Restricted Payments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) we may pay is limited to an amount up to $50 million.
Borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $357.7 million and $324.0 million, respectively. Of the $357.7 million outstanding as of December 31, 2024, $93.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver and $264.7 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan at December 31, 2023. These borrowings carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.7% at December 31, 2024 and 4.2% at December 31, 2023 including the impact of the interest rate swaps described in Note 12 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity" within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The borrowing capacity under the Revolver is reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the agreement and outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which are used as security deposits for our office facilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unused borrowing capacity under the Revolver was $506.6 million and $275.5 million, respectively.

7 “Financing Arrangements” for additional information on our senior secured credit facility within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties related to the Current Credit Agreement, see Part I—Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Future Financing Needs
Our primary financing need is to fund our long-term growth. Our growth strategy is to expand our service offerings, which may require investments in new hires, acquisitions of complementary businesses, possible expansion into other geographic areas, and related capital expenditures. 
We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with our available cash, and the borrowing capacity available under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to support our current financing needs and long-term growth strategy. Our ability to secure additional financing in the future, if needed, will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, the quality of our accounts receivable and unbilled services, our relative levels of debt and equity, and the overall condition of the credit markets.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate information relative to the current economic and business environment. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make assessments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies and estimates are important, we believe that there are five accounting policies and estimates that could be considered critical: revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services, business combinations, carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
We generate substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to our clients. We also generate revenues from software licenses, software support and maintenance and subscriptions to our cloud-based analytic tools and solutions, speaking engagements, conferences, and publications.
Our revenue is generated under four types of billing arrangements: fixed-fee (including software license revenue); time-and-expense; performance-based; and software support, maintenance and subscriptions. Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, multiple performance obligation arrangements require us to allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, for which we rely on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors. Provisions are recorded for the estimated realization on all engagements, including engagements for which fees are subject to review by the bankruptcy courts. We continually evaluate our estimates of the provisions based on available information and experiences. Additionally, when accounting for fixed-fee and performance-based billing arrangements, we must make additional judgments and estimates as further described below. 
In fixed-fee billing arrangements for professional services, we agree to a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. We set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the engagements. We generally recognize revenues under fixed-fee billing arrangements using a proportionate performance approach, which is based on work completed to date versus our estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement. Estimates of total engagement revenues and cost of services are monitored regularly during the term of the engagement. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. 
In performance-based billing arrangements, fees are tied to the attainment of contractually defined objectives. We enter into performance-based engagements in essentially two forms. First, we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving operational and cost effectiveness in the areas we review. Second, we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. We recognize revenue under performance-based billing arrangements using the following steps: 1) estimate variable consideration using either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, as appropriate, 2) apply a constraint to the estimated variable consideration to limit the amount that could be reversed when the uncertainty is resolved (the “constraint”), and 3) recognize revenue of estimated variable consideration, net of the constraint, based on work completed to date versus our estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement. Our estimates are monitored throughout the life of each contract and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience, and other information available at the time. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use for revenue recognition for performance-based billing arrangements are reasonable, subsequent changes could materially impact our results of operations.
See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revenue recognition accounting policy.
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Unbilled Services
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and for services performed but not yet billed based on several factors, including the estimated cash realization from amounts due from clients, an assessment of a client’s ability to make required payments, and the historical percentages of fee adjustments and write-offs by age of receivables and unbilled services. The allowances are assessed by management on a regular basis. These estimates may differ from actual results. If the financial condition of a client deteriorates in the future, impacting the client’s ability to make payments, an increase to our allowance might be required or our allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual write-offs.
36
Table of Contents

We record the provision for doubtful accounts and unbilled services as a reduction in revenue. To the extent we write-off accounts receivable due to a client’s inability to pay, the charge is recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
Business Combinations
We use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations
.
 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the exception of contract assets and liabilities which are recognized and measured in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policy described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within the notes to the consolidated financial statements
. 
Goodwill is recorded as the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, including any contingent consideration, over the net value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, such as the expected future cash flows to be derived from the intangible assets, discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows, and estimates of useful lives.
We measure and recognize contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration based on either a probability-weighted assessment of the specific financial performance targets being achieved or a Monte Carlo simulation model, as appropriate. These fair value measurements require the use of significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, including financial performance projections and discount rates. The fair value of the contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly based on assumptions used in our latest financial projections and input provided by practice leaders and management, with any change in the fair value estimate recorded in earnings in that period. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulting from changes in the estimates or assumptions could materially impact the financial statements. 
See Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestiture” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions and Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our contingent consideration liabilities. 
Carrying Values of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, we have three reporting units: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial. 
Under GAAP, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of current events or circumstances would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying value. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, no further testing is necessary. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that difference with the loss not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For a company such as ours, the income and market approaches will generally provide the most reliable indications of fair value because the value of such companies is dependent on their ability to generate earnings.
In the income approach, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves estimating the expected after-tax cash flows that will be generated by each reporting unit and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with each reporting unit and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted EBITDA margins, and discount rates. Our forecasts are based on historical experience, current backlog, expected market demand, and other industry information. 
In the market approach, we utilize the guideline company method, which involves calculating EBITDA multiples based on
operating data from guideline publicly traded companies. Multiples derived from guideline companies provide an indication of how much a
knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. These multiples are evaluated and adjusted based on
specific characteristics of the reporting units relative to the selected guideline companies and applied to the reporting units' operating data to
arrive at an indication of value.
The following is a discussion of the goodwill impairment test performed during 2024.
37
Table of Contents

Pursuant to our policy, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2024 for our three reporting units: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial. We elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and utilized the quantitative goodwill impairment test to provide an updated fair value for each reporting unit as the most recent valuation quantitative analysis performed was as of January 1, 2022.
For each reporting unit, we reviewed goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we relied on a combination of the income approach and the market approach, as discussed above, with a fifty-fifty weighting. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, we determined the fair value of the Healthcare, Education, and Commercial reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 105%, 185%, and 335%, respectively. As such, we concluded that there is no indication of goodwill impairment for these three reporting units.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying our valuation methodology are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not a non-cash goodwill impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of our reporting units will be consistent with our projections. We will monitor any changes to our assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods. Any significant decline in our operations could result in non-cash goodwill impairment charges. 
The carrying value of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of December 31, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):
Reporting Unit
Carrying Value
of Goodwill
Healthcare
$
453,528 
Education 
144,564 
Commercial
80,651 
Total
$
678,743 
Intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill. Our intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2024 and primarily consist of customer relationships, technology and software, trade names, customer contracts, and non-competition agreements, all of which were acquired through business combinations. We evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. No impairment charges for intangible assets were recorded in 2024.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. In determining our provision for income taxes on an interim basis, we estimate our annual effective tax rate based on information available at each interim period. Changes in applicable U.S. state, federal or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could materially affect our tax expense.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in management’s opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported. However, final determinations of prior year tax positions upon settlement with the taxing authority could be materially different from estimates. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material impact on our provision for taxes, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of our investments. We use certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
Interest Rate Risk
We have exposure to changes in interest rates associated with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. At our option, these borrowings will bear interest at one, three or six month Term SOFR or, in the case of the Revolver, an alternate base rate. At December 31, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling $357.7 million that carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%, including the impact of the interest rate swaps described below. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would have a $1.1 million effect on our pretax income on an annualized basis, including the effect of the interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling $324.0 million that carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%, including the impact of the interest rate swaps described below. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would have had a $0.7 million effect on our pretax income on an annualized basis, including the effect of the interest rate swaps.
We enter into forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the interest rate risks of our variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on one month Term SOFR and we pay to the counterparty a stated, fixed rate. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional amount of our forward interest rate swap agreements was $250.0 million. The outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2024 are scheduled to mature on a staggered basis through January 31, 2029.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar (USD) and the Indian Rupee (INR) related to our operations in India as part of our global delivery model. We hedge a portion of our cash flow exposure related to our INR-denominated intercompany expenses by entering into non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional amounts of these contracts were INR 1.40 billion, or $16.3 million, and INR 1.38 billion, or $16.6 million, respectively, based on the exchange rates in effect as of each period end. The outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of December 31, 2024 are scheduled to mature monthly through December 31, 2025.
We use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our foreign currency exchange rate hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the USD and INR would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of our hedge instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Market Risk
We have a 1.69% convertible debt investment in Shorelight Holdings, LLC, a privately-held company, which we account for as an available-for-sale debt security. As such, the investment is carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the investment was $62.3 million, with a total cost basis of $40.9 million. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investment was $68.0 million, with a total cost basis of $40.9 million.
We have a preferred stock investment in a privately-held hospital-at-home company, which we account for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative. As such, the investment is carried at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the investment was $7.4 million, with a total cost basis of $5.0 million. 
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. From time to time, we invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities. These investments principally consist of overnight sweep accounts. Due to the short maturity of these investments, we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure. Refer to Note 12 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
(i)
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii)
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii)
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 (2013)
.
 As a result of that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Huron Consulting Group Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Huron Consulting Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of

critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Fixed-Fee and Healthcare Performance-Based Billing Arrangements 
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fixed-fee billing arrangements, which make up a portion of total revenues of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company agrees to a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. As disclosed by management, under fixed-fee arrangements, revenues are recognized based upon work completed to date versus management’s estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement. Additionally, the Company’s Healthcare practice enters into performance-based billing arrangements whereby fees are tied to the attainment of contractually defined objectives, which make up a portion of total revenues of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Under performance-based billing arrangements, revenue is recognized based on an estimate of variable consideration and work completed to date versus the estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement. Variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, as appropriate,  net of a constraint to limit the amount that could be reversed when the uncertainty is resolved. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition under fixed-fee and Healthcare performance-based billing arrangements is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing the estimates of revenue to be recognized for these billing arrangements, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s significant assumptions related to work completed to date versus management’s estimates of the total services to be provided for fixed-fee and performance-based billing arrangements and the probability of attaining contractually defined objectives in performance-based billing arrangements. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process under fixed-fee and performance-based billing arrangements. These procedures also included, among others, testing the accuracy of the total contract amounts and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumption of work completed to date versus management’s estimates of the total services to be provided for a sample of engagements by (i) inquiring with the Company’s employees regarding the expected remaining efforts, (ii) evaluating trends in past performance, and (iii) evaluating performance to date. Additionally, for performance based billing arrangements, procedures included, among others, for a sample of engagements (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumption of the probability of attaining the contractually defined objectives by inquiring with the Company’s employees regarding the expected remaining efforts and the probability weighting of variable consideration to be earned and by evaluating trends in past performance, (ii) evaluating the necessity of applying a constraint, and (iii) evaluating performance to date towards the attainment of contractually defined objectives.

Description of Business
Huron is a global professional services firm that partners with clients to put possible into practice by creating sound strategies, optimizing operations, accelerating digital transformation, and empowering businesses to own their future. By embracing diverse perspectives, encouraging new ideas and challenging the status quo, we create sustainable results for the organizations we serve.
We provide our services and products and manage our business under three operating segments - Healthcare, Education, and Commercial - which aligns our business by industry. The Commercial segment includes all industries outside of healthcare and education, including, but not limited to, financial services, energy and utilities, industrials and manufacturing, and the public sector. We also provide revenue reporting across two principal capabilities: i) Consulting and Managed Services and ii) Digital, which are methods by which we deliver our services and products.
See Note 19 “Segment Information” for a discussion of our 
three
 segments.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Huron Consulting Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In the second quarter of 2024, we revised the presentation of our consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) to separately present other gains, net previously presented within selling, general and administrative expenses. The change in presentation had no effect on our consolidated results, and our historical consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) were revised for consistent presentation.
In the third quarter of 2024, we revised the line item descriptions of revenues to rename revenues as revenues before reimbursable expenses and to rename total revenues and reimbursable expenses as total revenues. The change in line item description has no impact on the line item totals for any periods presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
We generate substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to our clients. We also generate revenues from software licenses; software support and maintenance and subscriptions to our cloud-based analytic tools and solutions; speaking engagements; conferences; and publications. A single contract could include one or multiple performance obligations. For those contracts that have multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods and services provided are transferred to our customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services using the following steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligations.   
We generate our revenues under 
four
 types of billing arrangements: fixed-fee (including software license revenue); time-and-expense; performance-based; and software support, maintenance and subscriptions.
•
Fixed-fee (including software license revenue): In fixed-fee billing arrangements, we agree to a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. We set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the engagements. We generally recognize revenues under fixed-fee billing arrangements using a proportionate performance approach, which is based on work completed to date versus our estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement.

(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
Contracts within our culture and organizational excellence solution include fixed-fee partner contracts with multiple performance obligations, which primarily consist of coaching services, as well as speaking engagements, conferences, publications and software products (“Partner Contracts”). Revenues for coaching services and software products are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract. All other revenues under Partner Contracts, including speaking engagements, conferences and publications, are recognized at the time the goods or services are provided. Estimates of total engagement revenues and cost of services are monitored regularly during the term of the engagement. 
We also generate revenues from software licenses for our research administration and compliance software, which is generally recognized in the month in which the software is delivered. 
•
Time-and-expense: Under time-and-expense billing arrangements, we invoice our clients based on the number of hours worked by our revenue-generating professionals at agreed upon rates. Time-and-expense arrangements also include certain speaking engagements, conferences, and publications purchased by our clients outside of Partner Contracts within our culture and organizational excellence solution and the portion of our Healthcare managed services contracts that are billed under time-and-expense arrangements. We recognize revenues under time-and-expense arrangements as the related services or publications are provided, using the right to invoice practical expedient which allows us to recognize revenue in the amount that we have a right to invoice based on the number of hours worked and the agreed upon hourly rates or the value of the speaking engagements, conferences or publications purchased by our clients. 
•
Performance-based: In performance-based billing arrangements, fees are tied to the attainment of contractually defined objectives. We enter into performance-based engagements in essentially two forms. First, we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving operational and cost effectiveness in the areas we review. Second, we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. We recognize revenue under performance-based billing arrangements using the following steps: 1) estimate variable consideration using either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, as appropriate 2) apply a constraint to the estimated variable consideration to limit the amount that could be reversed when the uncertainty is resolved (the “constraint”), and 3) recognize revenue of estimated variable consideration, net of the constraint, based on work completed to date versus our estimates of the total services to be provided under the engagement. 
•
Software support, maintenance and subscriptions: Clients that have purchased one of our software licenses can pay an annual fee for software support and maintenance. We also generate subscription revenue from our cloud-based analytic tools and solutions including our cloud-based revenue cycle management software and research administration and compliance software. Software support, maintenance and subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the support or subscription period. These fees are generally billed in advance and included in deferred revenues until recognized. 
Provisions are recorded for the estimated realization adjustments on all engagements, including engagements for which fees are subject to review by the bankruptcy courts. 
Reimbursable expenses that are billed to clients, primarily relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements, are included in total revenues and reimbursable expenses. Reimbursable expenses are recognized as expenses in the period in which the expense is incurred.
The payment terms and conditions in our customer contracts vary. Differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue are recognized as either unbilled services or deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. Revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed to clients are recorded as unbilled services. Revenues recognized, but for which we are not yet entitled to bill because certain events, such as the completion of the measurement period or client approval, must occur, are recorded as contract assets and included within unbilled services. Client prepayments and retainers are classified as deferred revenues and recognized over future periods as earned in accordance with the applicable engagement agreement.

Capitalized Sales Commissions
Sales commissions earned by our sales professionals are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions with an expected amortization period greater than one year are deferred and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the revenue recognition model for the associated contract. We elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less. Amortization expense is recorded to direct costs.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we amortized $
0.3
 million, $
0.2
 million, and $
0.3
 million, respectively, of capitalized sales commissions. Unamortized sales commissions were $
0.5
 million and $
0.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Unbilled Services
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services based on several factors, including the estimated cash realization from amounts due from clients, an assessment of a client’s ability to make required payments, and the historical percentages of fee adjustments and write-offs by age of receivables and unbilled services. The allowances are assessed by management on a regular basis. These estimates may differ from actual results. If the financial condition of a client deteriorates in the future, impacting the client’s ability to make payments, an increase to our allowance might be required or our allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual write-offs.
We record the provision for doubtful accounts and unbilled services as a reduction in revenue. To the extent we write-off accounts receivable due to a client's inability to pay, the charge is recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
Direct Costs
Direct costs primarily consist of payroll costs for our revenue-generating professionals which includes salaries, performance bonuses, share-based compensation, signing and retention bonuses, payroll taxes and benefits. Direct costs also include fees paid to independent contractors that we retain to supplement our revenue-generating professionals, typically on an as-needed basis for specific client engagements, as well as technology costs, product and event costs, and commissions. Direct costs exclude reimbursable expenses and amortization of intangible assets and software development costs, both of which are separately presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Direct costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments, including overnight investments and commercial paper, with original maturities of 
three months
 or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
To the extent receivables from clients become delinquent, collection activities commence. No single client balance is considered large enough to pose a material credit risk. The allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services are based upon the expected ability to collect accounts receivable and bill and collect unbilled services. Management does not anticipate incurring losses on accounts receivable in excess of established allowances. See Note 19 “Segment Information” for concentration of accounts receivable and unbilled services.
We hold our cash in accounts at multiple third-party financial institutions. These deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We review the credit ratings of these financial institutions, regularly monitor the cash balances in these accounts, and adjust the balances as appropriate. However, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.
Long-term Investments
Our long-term investments consist of our convertible debt investment in Shorelight Holdings, LLC (“Shorelight”) and preferred stock investment in a hospital-at-home company. 
We classified the convertible debt investment in Shorelight as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. The investment is carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. If the investment is in an unrealized loss position due to significant credit deterioration of the investee, we recognize an allowance to decrease the carrying value of the investment to the fair value, which may be reversed in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. In the event there are realized gains and losses or credit allowances recognized, we will record the amount in earnings. We have not realized any gains or losses or recognized any credit allowance on our convertible debt investment as of December 31, 2024. See Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for additional information on our convertible debt investment.
We classified the preferred stock investment in the hospital-at-home company as an equity security without a readily determinable value at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. We elected to apply the measurement alternative at the time of purchase and will continue to do so until the investment does not qualify to be so measured. Under the measurement alternative, the investment is carried at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the company. On a quarterly basis, we review the information available to determine whether an orderly and observable transaction for the same or similar equity instrument occurred or if factors indicate that a significant decrease in value has occurred. We remeasure to the fair value of the preferred stock using such identified information with changes in the fair value recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.
 See Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for additional information on our preferred stock investment, including the cumulative unrealized gains recognized since our initial investment and the impairment loss recognized in 2023.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
See Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for the accounting policies used to measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Software, computers, and related equipment are depreciated over a useful life of 
two
 to 
four years
. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a useful life of 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the initial term of the lease.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement contains a lease and the classification of such lease at inception. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of our material leases are classified as operating leases; we have not entered into any material finance leases. For all operating leases with an initial term greater than 12 months, we recognize an operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and operating lease liability. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date and provided by the administrative agent for our senior secured credit facility in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets exclude lease incentives. We elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components. Certain lease agreements contain variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the operating lease ROU asset and operating lease liability; instead, they are expensed as incurred. Our leases may contain options to extend or terminate the lease, and we include these terms in our calculation of the operating lease ROU asset and operating lease liability when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with our accounting policy for impairment of long-lived assets, operating lease ROU assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group to which the operating lease ROU asset is assigned may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of the asset group based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows.
 See Note 5 “Leases” for additional information on our leases, including the lease impairment charges recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Software Development Costs
We capitalize internal and external software development costs related to our cloud computing applications and software for internal use, which we account for in accordance with 
ASC 350-40: Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Internal-Use Software; 
and related to software products that will be sold, leased, or marketed, which we account for in accordance with 
ASC 985: Software-Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed.
 These capitalized costs are included as a component of other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the related amortization is recorded to depreciation and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations.
Under ASC 350-40, we capitalize software development costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. As of December 31, 2024, gross capitalized internal-use software development costs and related accumulated amortization was $
94.3
 million and $
33.8
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, gross capitalized internal-use software development costs and related accumulated amortization was $
72.3
 million and $
26.8
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we amortized $
7.6
 million, $
6.5
 million, and $
5.9
 million, respectively, of such software development costs. 
Under ASC 985, software development costs are expensed until technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, and until the software is available for general release to customers, these software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. These capitalized development costs are amortized in proportion to current and future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the

product. As of December 31, 2024, gross capitalized software development costs related to software products that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed and related accumulated amortization was $
0.7
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we amortized $
0.1
 million of such capitalized costs. We did not capitalize any material development costs for this type of software during 2023. 
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
We incur costs to implement cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts. We capitalize certain costs associated with the implementation of the cloud computing arrangements, including employee payroll and related benefits and third party consulting costs, incurred during the application development stage of a project. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting service contracts, including renewal periods we are reasonably certain to exercise, and recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2024, gross capitalized implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement and related accumulated amortization was $
7.7
 million and $
3.0
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, gross capitalized implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement and related accumulated amortization was $
7.2
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recognized amortization of our capitalized implementation costs of $
0.8
 million, $
0.7
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively. Of the $
1.2
 million amortization for capitalized implementation costs in 2022, $
0.3
 million was recognized as a restructuring charge as it related to accelerated amortization of capitalized software implementation costs for a cloud-computing arrangement that is no longer in use. Our capitalized implementation costs primarily relate to the implementation of a new ERP system. In January 2021, we successfully went live with the new ERP system, and we continue to progress with additional functionality and integrations as scheduled. These capitalized costs are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill
Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives using a method that reflects the economic benefit expected to be derived from the assets or on a straight-line basis. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by considering events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a significant decline in forecasted operating results over an extended period of time. We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows.
 See Note 5 “Leases” and Note 11 “Restructuring Charges” for information on our operating lease ROU asset impairment charges recorded in 2024, 2023, 2022 and fixed asset impairment charges recorded in 2024 and 2023. No material impairment charges for other long-lived assets were recorded in 2024, 2023, or 2022.
Goodwill
For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, we have 
three
 reporting units: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial.

In 2024, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2024, pursuant to our policy, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date. Further, we evaluated whether any events have occurred, or any circumstances have changed since November 30, 2024 that would indicate goodwill may have become impaired since our annual impairment test. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2024, we determined that no indications of impairment have arisen since our annual goodwill impairment test.
In 2023, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2023, pursuant to our policy, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date. In 2022, we performed two goodwill impairment tests: an interim impairment test for each of our reporting units as of January 1, 2022 in connection with our operating model modification and the annual impairment test for each of our reporting units as of November 30. We did not identify any impairments during our interim or annual impairment tests performed during 2022. 
See Note 4 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information on our 2024 and 2023 annual goodwill impairment tests.

Business Combinations
We use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations
.
 Each acquired company’s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements starting on the date of acquisition. The purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred. The contract assets and contract liabilities acquired are recorded at their carrying value under Topic 606: 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. All other tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of purchase price over the net value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Contingent consideration, which is primarily based on the business achieving certain performance targets, is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings until settled.
 Refer to Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestiture” for additional information on our business acquisitions and refer to Note 13 “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for additional information regarding our contingent acquisition liability balances.
Income Taxes
Current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable, respectively, on the tax returns for the current year. We have elected to recognize the tax expense related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a current period expense when incurred. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. To the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income, a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets.
 Refer to Note 17 “Income Taxes” for further information regarding incomes taxes.
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the respective awards. We generally recognize share-based compensation ratably using the straight-line attribution method; however, for those awards with performance criteria and graded vesting features, we use the graded vesting attribution method. It is our policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. Refer to Note 16 “Equity Incentive Plan” for further information regarding share-based compensation.
Sponsorship and Advertising Costs
Sponsorship and advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
 Such expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $
10.2
 million, $
7.3
 million, and $
6.3
 million, respectively, and are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.
Debt Issuance Costs
We amortize the costs we incur to obtain debt financing over the contractual life of the related debt using the effective interest method for non-revolving debt and the straight-line method for revolving debt. The amortization expense is included in interest expense, net of interest income in our statement of operations. Unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to our senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”) are included as a discount to the Term Loan. Unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to our senior secured revolving credit facility are included as a component of other non-current assets.

Foreign Currency
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the United States Dollar (USD) are translated into USD using the exchange rates in effect at period end. Revenue and expense items are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
 We recognized $
2.1
 million of foreign currency transaction gains in 2024, $
0.5
 million of foreign currency transaction losses in 2023, and $
0.7
 million of foreign currency transaction gains in 2022.
Segment Reporting
Segments are defined as components of a company that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

and broaden our Microsoft capabilities. The results of operations of AXIA Consulting are included within our consolidated financial statements and allocated among our three operating segments based on the engagements delivered by the business.
The acquisitions of Vlamis, GG+A, and AXIA Consulting are not significant to our consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. The current acquisition date values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the AXIA Consulting acquisition are considered preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition. We believe that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed but certain items, such as the intangible assets valuations and the working capital adjustments, among other things, may be subject to change as additional information is received. Thus, the provisional measurements of assets acquired, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed related to the AXIA Consulting acquisition are subject to change. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date.

(2)    In 2024, we completed the divestiture of our Studer Education practice within our Healthcare segment, and allocated a portion of goodwill within the Healthcare segment to the disposed practice based on the relative fair values of Studer Education and the remaining segment. The allocated goodwill of $
2.3
 million was written off and included in the gain on sale of Studer Education. The sale of Studer Education did not meet the criteria for reporting separately as discontinued operations. In connection with the sale, we recorded a $
3.6
 million pretax gain which is included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
2024 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
Pursuant to our policy, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2024 for our 
three
 reporting units: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial. We elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and utilized a quantitative goodwill impairment test to provide an updated fair value for each reporting unit as of the most recent valuation quantitative analysis performed was as of January 1, 2022.
We reviewed goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we relied on a combination of the income approach and the market approach utilizing the guideline company method, with a fifty-fifty weighting. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, we determined the fair value of the Healthcare, Education, and Commercial reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 
105
%, 
185
%, and 
335
%, respectively. As such, we concluded that there is no indication of goodwill impairment for these three reporting units.
In the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis, which involved estimating the expected after-tax cash flows that will be generated by each reporting unit and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with each reporting unit and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted EBITDA margins, and discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, we relied on internally generated ten-year forecasts. Our forecasts are based on historical experience, current backlog, expected market demand, and other industry information.
In the market approach, we utilized the guideline company method, which involved calculating EBITDA multiples based on operating data from guideline publicly traded companies. Multiples derived from guideline companies provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. These multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on specific characteristics of each of the reporting units relative to the selected guideline companies and applied to the reporting units' operating data to arrive at an indication of value.

Further, we evaluated whether any events have occurred or any circumstances have changed since November 30, 2024 that would indicate goodwill may have become impaired since our annual impairment test. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2024, we determined that no indications of impairment have arisen since our annual goodwill impairment test.
The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of our reporting units will be consistent with our projections. We will monitor any changes to our assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods. Any significant decline in our operations could result in non-cash goodwill impairment charges. 
2023 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
Pursuant to our policy, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2023 for our 
three
 reporting units: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial. We performed a qualitative assessment considering the most recent quantitative analysis performed, actual performance, our internal financial projections, and current carrying value of each reporting unit; as well as other various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends for each reporting unit, and other entity-specific events. Based on our evaluation as of November 30, 2023, we determined that there were no indications of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units.

Leases
We lease office space, data centers and certain equipment under operating leases expiring on various dates through 2030, with various renewal options that can extend the lease terms by 
one
 to 
ten years
. Our operating leases include fixed payments plus, in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses. We exclude these variable payments from the measurements of our lease liabilities and expense them as incurred. We elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components. No lease agreements contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2024, we have not entered into any material finance leases. We sublease certain office spaces to third parties resulting from restructuring activities in certain locations. 
Lease Impairment Charges
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group to which the operating lease ROU asset is assigned may not be recoverable. First, we test the asset group for recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, which include expected future lease and nonlease payments related to the lease agreement offset by expected sublease income, to the carrying amount of the asset group. If the first step of the long-lived asset impairment test concludes that the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, we perform the second step of the long-lived asset impairment test by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying amount and recognizing a lease impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. To estimate the fair value of the asset group, we rely on a discounted cash flow approach using market participant assumptions of the expected cash flows and discount rate.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we recognized non-cash lease-related impairment charges of $
3.5
 million, $
6.3
 million, and $
0.2
 million, respectively. 
2024
During 2024, we exited our office space previously occupied by GG+A and a portion of our office space in New York, New York, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $
2.7
 million, of which $
2.0
 million was allocated to the operating lease ROU assets and $
0.7
 million was allocated to the related fixed assets based on their relative carrying amounts. Additionally, in 2024, we recognized $
0.8
 million of lease-related impairment charges driven by updated sublease assumptions for our previously vacated office spaces in Lexington, Massachusetts; and Lake Oswego, Oregon. Of the $
0.8
 million, $
0.7
 million was allocated to the fixed assets related to the office spaces and $
0.1
 million was allocated to the operating lease ROU assets based on their relative carrying amounts. 
2023
During 2023, we exited our office spaces in Hillsboro, Oregon and Lexington, Massachusetts, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $
5.4
 million, of which $
4.0
 million was allocated to the operating lease ROU assets and $
1.4
 million was allocated to the related fixed assets based on their relative carrying amounts. Additionally, in 2023, we recognized $
0.9
 million of lease-related impairment charges driven by updated sublease assumptions for our previously vacated office spaces in Hillsboro, Oregon; New York, New York; and Lake Oswego, Oregon. Of the $
0.9
 million, $
0.5
 million was allocated to the fixed assets related to the office spaces and $
0.4
 million was allocated to the operating lease ROU assets based on their relative carrying amounts. 
2022
The $
0.2
 million lease-related impairment charge recognized in 2022 resulted from updated sublease assumptions for our previously vacated office space in New York, New York and was allocated to the operating lease ROU asset.

Financing Arrangements
The Company has a $
600
 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $
275
 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), subject to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 15, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), both of which fully mature on 
November 15, 2027
. The Term Loan was established in February 2024 with the execution of Amendment No. 2 to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments of $
3.4
 million which began June 30, 2024 and continue through the maturity date of 
November 15, 2027
, at which time the outstanding principal balance and all accrued interest will be due. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had total borrowings outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement of $
357.7
 million, consisting of $
93.0
 million outstanding under the Revolver and $
264.7
 million outstanding under the Term Loan. 
A summary of the scheduled maturities of those borrowings follows:

2025
$
13,750

2026
$
13,750

2027
$
330,187

The initial borrowings under the Revolver were used to refinance borrowings outstanding under a prior credit agreement, and future borrowings under the Revolver may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, permitted acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to reduce borrowings under the Revolver.
The Amended Credit Agreement provides the option to increase the revolving credit facility or establish additional term loan facilities in an aggregate amount up to $
250
 million, subject to customary conditions and the approval of any lender whose commitment would be increased, resulting in a maximum available principal amount under the Amended Credit Agreement of $
1.13
 billion. 
Fees and interest on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement vary based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). At our option, these borrowings will bear interest at one, three or six month Term SOFR or, in the case of the Revolver, an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate between 
1.125
% per annum and 
1.875
% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings, or between 
0.125
% per annum and 
0.875
% per annum, in the case of base rate loans, based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The applicable margin for the outstanding principal under the Term Loan will range between 
1.625
% per annum and 
2.375
% per annum based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The fees and interest are subject to further adjustment based upon the Company's performance against specified key performance indicators. Based upon the performance of the Company against those key performance indicators in each Reference Year (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), certain adjustments to the otherwise applicable rates for interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees will be made. These annual adjustments will not exceed an increase or decrease of 
0.01
% in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the commitment fee rate or an increase or decrease of 
0.05
% in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the Term SOFR borrowings, base rate borrowings or letter of credit fee rate.

(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to prepay the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement in certain circumstances, including upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). In addition, we have the right to permanently reduce or terminate the unused portion of the commitments provided under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time.
The loans and obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Security Agreement and a Third Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. as collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company and the subsidiary guarantors grant Bank of America, N.A., for the ratable benefit of the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement, a first-priority lien, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of the personal property assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, and a pledge of 
100
% of the stock or other equity interests in all domestic subsidiaries and 
65
% of the stock or other equity interests in each “material first-tier foreign subsidiary” (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) entitled to vote and 
100
% of the stock or other equity interests in each material first-tier foreign subsidiary not entitled to vote.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties; affirmative and negative covenants, which include limitations on liens, investments, additional indebtedness, and restricted payments; and two quarterly financial covenants as follows: (i) a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA) of 
3.75
 to 1.00; however the maximum permitted Consolidated Leverage Ratio will increase to 
4.25
 to 1.00 upon the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), and (ii) a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest) of 
3.00
 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the financial covenants is calculated on a continuing operations basis and includes adjustments to add back non-cash goodwill impairment charges, share-based compensation costs, certain non-cash restructuring charges, pro forma historical EBITDA for businesses acquired, and other specified items in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. For purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio total debt is on a gross basis and is not netted against our cash balances. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants with a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 
1.39
 to 1.00 and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 
10.50
 to 1.00.

In connection with establishing the Term Loan, we incurred $

 million of debt issuance costs which were recognized as a discount to the Term Loan. These debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using an effective interest rate of 
7.34
% over the term of the Term Loan. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolver are included as a component of other non-current assets and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of the Revolver.
Borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 carried a weighted average interest rate of 
4.7
% and 
4.2
%, respectively, including the effect of the interest rate swaps described in Note 12 "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity."
The borrowing capacity under the Revolver is reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $
0.4
 million, which are used as security deposits for our office facilities. As of December 31, 2024, the unused borrowing capacity under the Revolver was $

. Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recognized total revenues of $1.52 billion, $1.40 billion, and $1.16 billion, respectively. Of the $1.52 billion total revenues recognized in 2024, we recognized revenues of $
26.3
 million from obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods, of which $
22.8
 million was primarily due to changes in the estimates of our variable consideration under performance-based billing arrangements and $
3.5
 million was primarily due to the release of allowances on receivables from clients and unbilled services. Of the $1.40 billion total revenues recognized in 2023, we recognized revenues of $
10.9
 million from obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods, of which $
9.6
 million was primarily due to changes in the estimates of our variable consideration under performance-based billing arrangements and $
1.3
 million was primarily due to the release of allowances on receivables from clients and unbilled services. Of the $1.16 billion total revenues recognized in 2022, we recognized revenues of $
7.6
 million from obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods, of which $
5.3
 million was primarily due to changes in the estimates of our variable consideration under performance-based billing arrangements and $
2.3
 million was primarily due to the release of allowances on receivables from clients and unbilled services.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
187.6
 million of remaining performance obligations under engagements with original expected durations greater than one year. These remaining performance obligations exclude variable consideration which has been excluded from the total transaction price due to the constraint and performance obligations under time-and-expense engagements which are recognized in the amount invoiced. Of the $
187.6
 million of performance obligations, we expect to recognize approximately $
80.4
 million as revenue in 2025, $
56.3
 million in 2026, and the remaining $
50.9
 million thereafter. Actual revenue recognition could differ from these amounts as a result of changes in the estimated timing of work to be performed, adjustments to estimated variable consideration in performance-based arrangements, or other factors.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
The payment terms and conditions in our customer contracts vary. Differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue are recognized as either unbilled services or deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Unbilled services include revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed to clients. Services performed that we are not yet entitled to bill because certain events, such as the completion of the measurement period or client approval in performance-based engagements, must occur are recorded as contract assets and included within unbilled services, net. The contract asset balance, net as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
60.1
 million and $
70.1
 million, respectively. The $

 million decrease primarily reflects timing differences between the completion of our performance obligations and the amounts billed or billable to clients in accordance with their contractual billing terms. 
Client prepayments and retainers are classified as deferred revenues and recognized over future periods in accordance with the applicable engagement agreement and our revenue recognition accounting policy. Our deferred revenues balance as of December 31, 2024

and 2023 was $
26.9
 million

and

$
22.5
 million respectively. The $
4.4
 million increase primarily reflects timing differences between client payments in accordance with their contract terms and the completion of our performance obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, $
21.9
 million of revenues recognized were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $
21.3
 million of revenues recognized were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022.
10. 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted common stock. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential reduction in earnings per share that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock under the treasury stock method. Such securities or other contracts include unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units, and outstanding common stock options, to the extent dilutive. In periods for which we report a net loss, diluted weighted average common shares outstanding excludes all potential common stock equivalents as their impact on diluted net loss per share would be anti-dilutive.

Share Repurchase Program
In November 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to $
50
 million of our common stock through December 31, 2021. The share repurchase program has been subsequently extended and increased, most recently in the second quarter of 2024. The current authorization extends the share repurchase program through 
December 31, 2025
 with a repurchase amount of $
500
 million. The amount and timing of repurchases under the share repurchase program were and will continue to be determined by management and depend on a variety of factors, including the trading price of our common stock, capacity under our credit facility, general market and business conditions, and applicable legal requirements.
During 2024, we repurchased and retired 
1,218,434

12. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity
In the normal course of business, we use forward interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and we use non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our Indian Rupee-denominated expenses of our operations in India. From time to time, we may enter into additional forward interest rate swaps or non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts to further hedge against our interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
We have designated all of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded to other comprehensive income to the extent effective and reclassified to earnings upon settlement.
Interest Rate Swaps
We are party to forward interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of $
250.0
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on 
one month
 Term SOFR and we pay to the counterparty a stated, fixed rate. The forward interest rate swap agreements have staggered maturities through 
January 31, 2029
. 
As of December 31, 2024, it was anticipated that $
1.2
 million of the gains, net of tax, related to interest rate swaps currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into interest expenses, net of interest income in our consolidated statement of operations within the next 
12
 months.
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts
We are party to non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts that are scheduled to mature monthly through 
December 31, 2025
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional amounts of these contracts were INR 
1.40
 billion, or $
16.3
 million, and INR 
1.38
 billion, or $
16.6
 million, respectively, based on the exchange rates in effect as of each period end.
As of December 31, 2024, it was anticipated that all of the $
0.3
 million losses, net of tax, related to foreign exchange forward contracts currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into direct costs in our consolidated statement of operations within the next 
12
 months.

All of our derivative instruments are transacted under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements. These agreements permit the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default and certain other termination events. Although netting is permitted, it is our policy to record all derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheet.
 Refer to Note 14 “Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” for additional information on our derivative instruments.
13. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value and requires companies to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows:
Level 1 Inputs

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs

Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 Inputs

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

Interest rate swaps: 
The fair values of our interest rate swaps were derived using estimates to settle the interest rate swap agreements, which are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows on each leg of the swaps utilizing market-based inputs and a discount rate reflecting the risks involved. See Note 12 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” for additional information on our interest rate swaps.
Foreign exchange forward contracts:
 The fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts were derived using estimates to settle the foreign exchange forward contracts agreements, which are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows on each contract utilizing market-based inputs, including both forward and spot prices, and a discount rate reflecting the risks involved. Refer to Note 12 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” for additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts.
Deferred compensation assets: 
We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”) for the members of our board of directors and a select group of our employees. The deferred compensation liability is funded by the Plan assets, which consist of life insurance policies maintained within a trust. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies approximates fair value and is based on third-party broker statements which provide the fair value of the life insurance policies' underlying investments, which are Level 2 inputs. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is invested primarily in mutual funds. The Plan assets are included in other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) from the deferred compensation assets are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans” for additional information on the Plan.
Convertible debt investment: 
Since 2014, we have invested $
40.9
 million, in the form of 
1.69
% convertible debt in Shorelight Holdings, LLC (“Shorelight”), the parent company of Shorelight, a U.S.-based company that partners with leading nonprofit universities to increase access to and retention of international students, boost institutional growth, and enhance an institution’s global footprint. The convertible notes will mature on 
January 17, 2027
, unless converted earlier.
To determine the appropriate accounting treatment for our investment, we performed a variable interest entity (“VIE”) analysis and concluded that Shorelight does not meet the definition of a VIE. We also reviewed the characteristics of our investment to confirm that the convertible 
F-27
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
notes are not in-substance common stock that would warrant equity method accounting. After we reviewed all of the terms of the investment, we concluded the appropriate accounting treatment to be that of an available-for-sale debt security. We continue to monitor the key factors of our VIE analysis and the terms of the convertible notes to ensure our accounting treatment is appropriate. We have not identified any changes to Shorelight or our investment, that would change our classification of the investment as an available-for-sale debt security. 
The investment is carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. The carrying value is recorded in long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the fair value of our investment using a scenario-based approach in the form of a hybrid analysis that consists of a Monte Carlo simulation model and an expected return analysis. The conclusion of value for our investment is based on the probability-weighted assessment of both scenarios. The hybrid analysis utilizes certain assumptions including the assumed holding period through the maturity date of 
January 17, 2027
; the applicable waterfall distribution at the end of the expected holding period based on the rights and privileges of the various instruments; cash flow projections discounted at the risk-adjusted rate of 
23.5
% and 
24.5
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and the concluded equity volatility of 
40.0
% and 
35.0
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of which are Level 3 inputs. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the investment, which would result in different impacts to our consolidated balance sheet and comprehensive income. Actual results may differ from our estimates.

Contingent consideration for business acquisitions: 
We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration using either a probability-weighted assessment of the specific financial performance targets being measured or a Monte Carlo simulation model, as appropriate. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our contingent consideration are our measures of the estimated payouts based on internally generated financial projections on a probability-weighted basis and a discount rate which was 
5.6
% and 
6.3
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of the contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly based on assumptions used in our latest projections and input provided by practice leaders and management. Any change in the fair value estimate is recorded to other losses (gains), net in our consolidated statement of operations for that period. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability, which would result in different impacts to our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations. Actual results may differ from our estimates.

Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:
Preferred Stock Investment
In the

fourth quarter of 2019, we invested $
5.0
 million in a hospital-at-home company. The investment was made in the form of preferred stock. To determine the appropriate accounting treatment for our preferred stock investment, we performed a VIE analysis and concluded that the company does not meet the definition of a VIE. We also reviewed the characteristics of our investment to confirm that the preferred stock is not in-substance common stock that would warrant equity method accounting. After we reviewed all of the terms of the investment, we concluded the appropriate accounting treatment for our investment to be that of an equity security with no readily determinable fair value. We elected to apply the measurement alternative at the time of the purchase and will continue to do so until the investment does not qualify to be so measured. Under the measurement alternative, the investment is carried at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same company. On a quarterly basis, we review the information available to determine whether an orderly and observable transaction for the same or similar equity instrument occurred or if factors indicate that a significant decrease in value has occurred. We remeasure to the fair value of the preferred stock using such identified information with changes in the fair value recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. The carrying value of the preferred stock investment is recorded in long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.  
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $
26.3
 million on our preferred stock investment recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations, based on the valuation established in the most recent financing round. During the first quarter of 2022, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $
27.0
 million, based on the observable price change of preferred stock issued by the company with similar rights and preferences to our preferred stock, a Level 2 input. There were no observable price changes or factors to indicate that a significant decrease in enterprise value occurred in 2024. Since our initial investment, we have recognized cumulative unrealized gains of $
28.6
 million and cumulative unrealized losses of $
26.3
 million. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of our preferred stock investment was $
7.4
 million.
Senior Secured Credit Facility
The carrying value of our borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility is stated at cost. Our carrying value approximates fair value, using Level 2 inputs, as the senior secured credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on current market rates as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 7 “Financing Arrangements” for additional information on our senior secured credit facility.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Other Financial Instruments
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. The carrying values of all other financial instruments not described above reasonably approximate fair market value due to the nature of the financial instruments and the short-term maturity of these items.

Refer to Note 12 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” for additional information on our derivative instruments.

15. 
Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans
We sponsor a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees. Under the plan, employees are entitled to make pretax, post-tax, and/or Roth post-tax contributions up to the annual maximums established by the Internal Revenue Service. We match an amount equal to the employees’ contributions up to 
6
% of the employees’ eligible earnings. Our matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
41.0
 million, $
37.0
 million, and $
31.2
 million, respectively.
We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”) that is administered by our board of directors or a committee designated by the board of directors. Under the Plan, members of the board of directors and a select group of our employees may elect to defer the receipt of their director retainers and meeting fees or base salary and bonus, as applicable. Additionally, we may credit amounts to a participant’s deferred compensation account in accordance with employment or other agreements entered into between us and the participant. At our sole discretion, we may, but are not required to, credit any additional amount we desire to any participant’s deferred compensation account. Amounts credited are subject to vesting schedules set forth in the Plan, employment agreement, or any other agreement entered into between us and the participant. The deferred compensation liability at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
42.3
 million and $
34.7
 million, respectively. This deferred compensation liability is fully funded by the Plan assets.

16. 
Equity Incentive Plans
We grant share-based awards under the Company's 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) which permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other share-based or cash-based awards valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, our common stock. Subsequent to the initial approval of the 2012 Plan and through December 31, 2024, our shareholders approved amendments to the 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance to 
5.4
 million, in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2024, 
0.8
 million shares remain available for issuance under the 2012 Plan. 
On May 1, 2015, we adopted the Stock Ownership Participation Program (the “SOPP”), which is available to Huron employees below the managing director and principal levels who do not receive equity-based awards as part of their normal compensation plan. Under the SOPP, eligible employees may elect to use after-tax payroll deductions or cash contributions to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on certain designated purchase dates. Employees who purchase stock under the SOPP are granted restricted stock equal to 
25
% of their purchased shares. Vesting of the restricted stock is subject to both a time-based vesting schedule and a requirement that the purchased shares be held for a specified period. Subsequent to the initial approval of the SOPP and through December 31, 2024, our shareholders approved amendments to the SOPP to increase the total number of shares authorized for issuance to 
0.9
 million, in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2024, 
0.2
 million shares remain available for issuance under the SOPP. 
It has been our practice to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and granting of restricted stock from authorized but unissued shares, with the exception of the SOPP under which shares are issued from treasury stock. Certain grants of restricted stock under the 2012 Plan may be issued from treasury stock at the direction of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee of the board of directors has the responsibility of interpreting the 2012 Plan and SOPP and determining all of the terms and conditions of awards made under the plans, including when the awards will become exercisable or otherwise vest.
Share-based awards outstanding under our 2012 Plan provide for a retirement eligibility provision, under which eligible employees who have reached 
62
 years of age and have completed 
seven years
 of employment with Huron will continue vesting in their share-based awards after retirement, subject to certain conditions. 
Total share-based compensation cost recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
45.1
 million, $
45.7
 million, and $
31.0
 million, respectively, with related income tax benefits of $
9.4
 million,

$
9.3
 million, and $
6.8
 million,

respectively. The $
45.1
 million of shared-based compensation cost recognized in 2024 included $
0.5
 million recorded to restructuring charges as it related to the modification of certain nonvested share-based compensation awards to accelerate vesting upon the completed sale of the Studer Education practice. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
64.4
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
2.8
 years.

Performance-based Share Awards
The total number of shares earned by recipients of performance-based share awards is contingent upon meeting practice specific and/or company-wide performance goals. Following the performance period, certain awards are subject to the completion of a service period, which is generally an additional 
two years
. These earned awards vest on a graded vesting schedule over the service period. For certain performance awards, the recipients may earn additional shares of stock for performance achieved above the stated target. The grant date fair values of our performance-based share awards are measured based on the fair value of our common stock at grant date. Compensation cost is amortized into expense over the service period, including the performance period.
The table below summarizes the performance-based stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2024. All nonvested performance-based stock outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was granted under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Performance-based Stock Options
Beginning in 2022, the Company granted performance-based stock options which are earned by the recipients contingent upon meeting practice specific goals. Following the performance period, these awards are subject to the completion of a service period of an additional 
two years
. These earned awards vest on a graded vesting schedule over the service period. The performance-based stock options were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost is amortized into expense over the service period, including the performance period. Our performance-based stock options have a contractual term of 
7
 years.
The fair values of the performance-based stock options granted during 2024 and 2023 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate was based on the rate of U.S. Treasury bills with an equivalent expected term of the stock options at the time of the option grant. The expected option life was estimated using the simplified method, which is a weighted average of the vesting term and the contractual term, to determine the expected term. The simplified method was used due to the lack of sufficient data available to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had valuation allowances of $6.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the ability to utilize deferred tax assets recorded for foreign losses and tax credits. The increase in valuation allowances in 2024 primarily related to an increase in foreign tax credits carryforwards.
The Company has foreign net operating losses of $
3.5
 million which begin to expire in 2027, if not utilized. We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $
2.2
 million which will begin to expire in 2030, if not utilized. 
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
A reconciliation of our beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
Lease Commitments
We lease office space, data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements expiring on various dates through 2030, with various renewal options. Office facilities under operating leases include fixed payments plus, in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses. See Note 5 “Leases” for additional information on our leases, including the remaining expected lease payments under our operating leases as of December 31, 2024.
Litigation
In the second quarter of 2024, we recognized a $
15.0
 million pre-tax litigation settlement gain related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff, which is included in other gains, net on our consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2024, all of the $
15.0
 million settlement was received.
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to any litigation or legal proceeding or subject to any claim that, in the current opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings, actual results could differ from current expected results.
Guarantees
Guarantees in the form of letters of credit totaling $
0.4
 million and $
0.5
 million were outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are used as security deposits for our office facilities.
In connection with certain business acquisitions, we may be required to pay post-closing consideration to the sellers if specific financial performance targets are met over a number of years as specified in the related purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total estimated fair value of our outstanding contingent consideration liability was $
0.2
 million and $
2.1
 million, respectively.  
To the extent permitted by law, our bylaws and articles of incorporation require that we indemnify our officers and directors against judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with civil or criminal action or proceedings, as it relates to their services to us if such person acted in good faith. Although there is no limit on the amount of indemnification, we may have recourse against our insurance carrier for certain payments made.

Segment Information
We provide our services and products and manage our business under three reportable segments: Healthcare, Education, and Commercial, which align our business by industry.
•
Healthcare
Our Healthcare segment serves acute care providers, including national and regional health systems; academic health systems; community health systems; the federal health system; and public, children’s and critical access hospitals, and non-acute care providers, including physician practices and medical groups; payors; and long-term care or post-acute providers. Our healthcare-focused services and products include financial and operational performance improvement consulting, which spans revenue cycle, business operations and care delivery transformation; digital offerings, spanning technology and analytic-related services, which includes enterprise health record (“EHR”), enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and enterprise performance management (“EPM”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), data management, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation, and technology managed services, and a portfolio of software products; organizational transformation; revenue cycle managed services and outsourcing; financial and capital advisory consulting; and strategy and innovation consulting.
•
Education

F-37
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
spanning technology and analytic-related services, including student information systems, ERP and EPM, CRM, data management, AI and automation, and technology managed services and our Huron Research Suite product suite (the leading software suite designed to facilitate and improve research administration service delivery and compliance); our research-focused consulting and managed services; our strategy and operations consulting services, which span finance, accounting, operations and athletics to organization and talent strategy and student and academic strategy; and our global philanthropy consulting services.
•
Commercial
Our Commercial segment is focused on serving industries and organizations facing significant disruption and regulatory change by helping them adapt to rapidly changing environments and accelerate business transformation. Our Commercial professionals work primarily with six primary buyers: the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the chief strategy officer, the chief human resources officer, the chief operating officer, and organizational advisors, including lenders and law firms. We have a deep focus on serving organizations in the financial services, energy and utilities, industrials and manufacturing industries and the public sector while opportunistically serving commercial industries more broadly, including professional and business services, life sciences, consumer products, and retail. Our Commercial professionals use their deep industry, functional and technical expertise to deliver our digital services and software products, financial and capital advisory (special situation advisory and corporate finance advisory) consulting services, and strategy and innovation consulting services. 
Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is our chief executive officer, manages the business under these 
three
 reportable segments. Our CODM uses segment operating income in the annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting process as well as on a monthly basis for evaluating the performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment. Our CODM does not evaluate segments using asset information.
Segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment, less operating expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated costs include corporate costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner, as well as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense that are not attributable to a particular segment. The administrative function costs include corporate office support costs, office facility costs, costs related to accounting and finance, human resources, legal, marketing, information technology, and company-wide business development functions, as well as costs related to overall corporate management. 
The tables below set forth information about our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not present financial information by geographic area because the financial results of our international operations are not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

he following tables illustrate the disaggregation of segment total revenues and segment revenues before reimbursable expenses by our two principal capabilities: i) Consulting and Managed Services and ii) Digital, and includes a reconciliation to consolidated total revenues and consolidated revenues before reimbursable expenses. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that we bill to our clients at cost.
