OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS
We provide our services and products and manage our business under three operating segments - Healthcare, Education, and Commercial - which aligns our business by industry. The Commercial segment includes all industries outside of healthcare and education, including, but not limited to, financial services, energy and utilities, industrials and manufacturing, and the public sector. We also provide revenue reporting across two principal capabilities: i) Consulting and Managed Services and ii) Digital, which are methods by which we deliver our services and products.
Operating Industries
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we derived 51%, 32% and 17% of our consolidated revenues before reimbursable expenses from our Healthcare, Education and Commercial operating segments, respectively.
•
Healthcare
Our Healthcare segment serves acute care providers, including national and regional health systems; academic health systems; community health systems; the federal health system; and public, children’s and critical access hospitals, and non-acute care providers, including physician practices and medical groups; payors; and long-term care or post-acute providers. Our healthcare-focused services and products include financial and operational performance improvement consulting, which spans revenue cycle, business operations and care delivery transformation; digital offerings, spanning technology and analytic-related services, including enterprise health record (“EHR”), enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and enterprise performance management (“EPM”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), data management, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation, and technology managed services, and a portfolio of software products; organizational transformation; revenue cycle managed services and outsourcing; financial and capital advisory consulting; and strategy and innovation consulting. 
•
Education
Our Education segment serves public and private colleges and universities, research institutes, not-for-profit organizations and other education-related organizations. Our education and research-focused services and products include our digital offerings, spanning technology and analytic-related services, including student information systems, ERP and EPM, CRM, data management, AI and automation, and technology managed services and our Huron Research Suite product suite (the leading software suite designed to facilitate and improve research administration service delivery and compliance); our research-focused consulting and managed services; our strategy and operations consulting services, which span finance, accounting, operations and athletics to organization and talent strategy and student and academic strategy; and our global philanthropy consulting services, which were bolstered by the acquisition of Grenzebach Glier and Associates in March of 2024.

Commercial
Our Commercial segment is focused on serving industries and organizations facing significant disruption and regulatory change by helping them adapt to rapidly changing environments and accelerate business transformation. Our Commercial professionals work primarily with six primary buyers: the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the chief strategy officer, the chief human resources officer, the chief operating officer, and organizational advisors, including lenders and law firms. We have a deep focus on serving organizations in the financial services, energy and utilities, industrials and manufacturing industries and the public sector while opportunistically serving commercial industries more broadly, including professional and business services, life sciences, consumer products, and retail. Our Commercial professionals use their deep industry, functional and technical expertise to deliver our digital services and software products, financial and capital advisory (special situation advisory and corporate finance advisory) consulting services, and strategy and innovation consulting services. In December 2024, we expanded our Commercial consulting and digital services offerings through the acquisition of AXIA Consulting, a leading provider of supply chain-focused consulting and technology solutions who has deep expertise in the industrials and manufacturing and retail sectors.

Within each of our operating segments, we provide our offerings under two principal capabilities: i) Consulting and Managed Services and ii) Digital.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING
Our business development and marketing activities are aimed at cultivating relationships, generating leads, and building a strong brand reputation with offices of the C-suite and senior level influencers and decision makers of organizations within our core industries. We believe excellent service delivery to clients is critical to building and maintaining relationships and sustaining and strengthening our brand reputation, and we emphasize the importance of high-quality client service to all of our employees.
Currently, we generate new business opportunities through the combination of relationships our managing directors and principals have with individuals working at our prospective clients and with our technology partners and marketing activities. We also view market-based collaboration between our employees as a key component in building our business. Often, the client relationship of an employee in one area

of our business leads to opportunities in another area, enhancing the opportunity to increase wallet share at a specific client. All of our managing directors and principals understand their roles in ongoing relationship and business development, which is reinforced through our compensation and incentive programs. We actively seek to identify new business opportunities and frequently receive referrals and repeat business from past and current clients. In addition, to complement the business development efforts of our managing directors, we have dedicated business development professionals who are focused exclusively on developing client relationships and generating new business.
COMPETITION
The professional services industry is extremely competitive, highly fragmented, and constantly evolving. The industry includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including other strategy, business operations, technology, and financial advisory consulting firms; general management consulting firms; the consulting practices of major accounting firms; technical and economic advisory firms; regional and specialty consulting firms; consulting divisions of our technology partners; and the internal professional resources of organizations. We compete with a large number of service and technology providers in all of our segments. Our competitors vary, depending on the particular industry and expertise area, and we expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include reputation, the ability to attract and retain top talent, the capacity to manage engagements effectively and with the highest quality to drive value for clients, and the ability to deliver measurable and sustainable results. There is also competition on price, although to a lesser extent due to the criticality of the issues that many of our services and products address. Some competitors have a greater geographic footprint, including a broader international presence, and more resources than we do, but we believe our reputation, industry and capability expertise, and ability to deliver high-value, quality service and measurable results to our clients across a balanced portfolio of offerings and to attract and retain employees with broad capabilities and deep industry expertise enable us to compete favorably in the professional services marketplace.
