Market Information

Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “ADUS.”

Holders

As of December 31, 2024, 2.0% of our shares of common stock were held by our officers and directors and approximately 98.0% of our common stock was held by 440 institutional investors. An insignificant amount of common stock is held by individual holders. As of February 18, 2025, Addus HomeCare Corporation had approximately 43,455 shareholders of its common stock, including 85 shareholders of record.

Dividends

We have never paid dividends on our common stock, including in the two most recent fiscal years, and we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently plan to retain any earnings to support the operation, and to finance the growth, of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our credit facility restricts our ability to declare or pay any dividend or other distribution to Holdings unless no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would arise as a result thereof and the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions paid in any fiscal year does not exceed $10.0 million per annum.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FIN
ANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks as well as other factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Overview

We are a home care services provider operating three segments: personal care, hospice and home health. Our services are principally provided in-home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our consumers are predominantly “dual eligible,” meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Managed care revenues accounted for 34.8%, 36.6% and 36.0% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.

A summary of certain consolidated financial and statistical data results for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are provided in the table below.

The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, other non-operating income, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructure and other non-recurring costs, gain or loss on the sale of assets, impairment of operating lease assets, retroactive rate increases from New York and the retroactive impact from collective bargaining negotiations. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure used by management that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors, management and others in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, to provide investors with insight and consistency in the Company’s financial reporting and to present a basis for comparison of the Company’s business operations among periods, and to facilitate comparison with the results of the Company’s peers. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate the financial performance of other public companies. The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully evaluated.

Acquisitions

In addition to our organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets, with the goal of having all three levels of in-home care in our markets, or facilitating our entry into new markets where in-home care has been moving to managed care organizations.

On January 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of CareStaff for approximately $1.0 million, with funding provided by available cash. With the purchase of CareStaff, the Company expanded its personal care services to consumers in Florida.

On August 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care for approximately $111.2 million, with funding primarily provided by drawing on the Company’s revolving credit facility. With the purchase of Tennessee Quality Care, the Company expanded its services within its hospice and home health segment to Tennessee.

On March 9, 2024, we completed our acquisition of the operations of Upstate for $0.4 million, with funding provided by available cash. With the purchase of Upstate, the Company expanded its personal care services segment in South Carolina.

Table of Contents

On December 2, 2024, we completed the Gentiva Acquisition for approximately $353.6 million, with funding primarily provided by drawing on the Company’s revolving credit facility and a portion of the net proceeds of the Company’s public offering of common stock. The purchase price is subject to the completion of working capital and related adjustments. With the Gentiva Acquisition, the Company expanded its services within its personal care services segment in Arizona, Arkansas, California and North Carolina, and entered the market in Missouri and Texas. The home health segment also was expanded in Tennessee.

Divestiture

Effective May 20, 2024, we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to sell all of our New York operations (the “New York Asset Sale”). The Company entered into a consulting agreement with the purchaser, as the transfer of clients and caregivers and payment for assets pursuant to the New York Asset Sale is occurring over time as regulatory approvals are received, coordination of the transfer of clients and caregivers occurs, and the change of control takes place. In connection with this transaction, the Company will cease operations in New York. In October 2024, the Company qualified for sale consideration of the New York Asset Sale. As a result, the Company has deconsolidated the results of its New York operations and recorded a gain on divestiture of $3.7 million. The New York Asset Sale purchase price of up to $23.0 million includes an initial payment of $4.6 million, $6.9 million paid pro rata as a deferred payment as caregivers are transferred and 50% in the form of contingent consideration for the Company’s Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (“CDPAP”) business.

Revenue by Payor and Significant States

Our payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, administrative and budgetary changes and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations, which we believe aligns with our emphasis on coordinated care and the reduction of the need for acute care. Medicare advantage revenue is included within Medicare.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our revenue by payor and significant states by segment were as follows:

With the Gentiva Acquisition, the Company expanded its home health services to patients in the state of Tennessee. With the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care in 2023, the Company expanded its home health services to patients in the state of Tennessee.

We derive a significant amount of our net service revenues in Illinois, which represented 43.7% and 44.5% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A significant amount of our revenue is derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for our Illinois personal care operations, which accounted for 21.0% and 20.9% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Changes in Illinois Reimbursement

The City of Chicago requires the Chicago minimum wage to be adjusted annually based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), subject to a cap and other requirements. On July 1, 2024, the rate was adjusted to $16.20 based on the increase in the CPI.

The Illinois Medicaid omnibus legislation passed in June 2023 included an increase in hourly rates for in-home care services to $28.07, which took effect on January 1, 2024, and required a minimum wage rate of $17.00 per hour. CMS approved an amendment to the Illinois HCBS waiver for Persons who are Elderly, which included the rate increase for in-home care services to $28.07, effective January 1, 2024.

The Illinois fiscal year 2025 budget includes an increase in hourly rates for in-home care services to $29.63, effective January 1, 2025, and required a minimum wage of $18.00 per hour for direct service workers. CMS approved an amendment to Illinois’ Persons who are Elderly waiver program that included this rate increase, effective January 1, 2025.

36

Table of Contents

Our business will benefit from the rate increases noted above as planned for 2025, but there is no assurance that there will be additional rate increases in Illinois for fiscal years beyond fiscal year 2025 to offset increases to minimum wage, and our financial performance will be adversely impacted for any periods in which an additional offsetting reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.

Changes in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement

Hospice

Hospice services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare Hospice Prospective Payment System, under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. The daily rate depends on the level of care provided to a patient (routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, or general inpatient care). Daily rates are adjusted for factors such as area wage levels. CMS updates hospice payment rates each federal fiscal year. Effective October 1, 2024, CMS increased hospice payment rates by 2.9%. This reflects a 3.4% market basket increase and a negative 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Hospices that do not satisfy quality reporting requirements are subject to a 4-percentage point reduction to the market basket update.

Overall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number are subject to an inpatient cap and an aggregate cap. The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care for which Medicare will pay to no more than 20% of total patient care days. Days in excess of the limitation are paid at the routine home care rate. The aggregate cap, which is set each federal fiscal year, limits the total Medicare reimbursement that a hospice may receive in a cap year (typically the federal fiscal year), based on an annual per-beneficiary cap amount and the number of Medicare patients served. The aggregate cap was updated to $34,465.34 for federal fiscal year 2025. If a hospice’s Medicare payments exceed its inpatient or aggregate caps, it must repay Medicare the excess amount.

Home Health

Home health services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System (“HHPPS”), which uses national, standardized 30-day period payment rates for periods of care that meet a certain threshold of home health visits (periods of care that do not meet the visit threshold are paid a per-visit payment rate for the discipline providing care). Although payment is made for each 30-day period, the HHPPS permits continuous 60-day certification periods through which beneficiaries are verified as eligible for the home health benefit. The daily home health payment rate is adjusted for case-mix and area wage levels. CMS uses the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”) as the case-mix classification model to place periods of care into payment categories, classifying patients based on clinical characteristics and their resource needs. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care where costs exceed a specific threshold amount.

CMS updates the HHPPS payment rates each calendar year. For calendar year 2025, CMS estimates that Medicare payments to home health agencies will increase by 0.5%. This is based on a home health payment update percentage of 2.7%, which reflects a 3.2% market basket update, reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.5 percentage points and an estimated 1.8% decrease associated with the transition to the PDGM, among other changes. Home health providers that do not comply with quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2-percentage point reduction to their market basket update. In addition, Medicare requires home health agencies to submit a one-time Notice of Admission (“NOA”) for each patient that establishes that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home health period of care. Failure to submit the NOA within five calendar days from the start of care will result in a reduction to the 30-day period payment amount for each day from the start of care date until the date the NOA is submitted.

Under the nationwide Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) Model, home health agencies receive increases or decreases to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5% based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Data collected in each performance year will impact Medicare payments two years later.

In certain states, payment of claims may be impacted by the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services, a program intended to identify and prevent fraud, reduce the number of Medicare appeals and improve provider compliance with Medicare program requirements. The program is currently limited to home health agencies in Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Florida and Texas. Providers in states subject to the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services may initially select either pre-claim review or post-payment review. Home health agencies that maintain high compliance levels are eligible for additional options that may be less burdensome. This program has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

CMS Final Rule: 
“
Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services
”

In May 2024, CMS finalized a rule intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the “80/20” or “payment adequacy” requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80% of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide, and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under specified programs are spent on total compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. The final rule includes several other measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. Given the very long implementation period and the likelihood of further changes as a result of litigation, administration and congressional changes, further rule-making and state changes in response to the final rule, it is premature to predict the ultimate impact of the final rule on our business.

Potential Developments

Home care and other healthcare providers may be significantly impacted by changes to the Medicaid program, including changes resulting from legislation and administrative actions at the federal and state levels. Federal actions may impact funding for, or the structure of, the Medicaid program and may shape provider reimbursement rates, eligibility and coverage policies and other aspects of state Medicaid programs. Currently, the federal government pays a percentage match for state Medicaid expenditures that varies by state and other factors, with no pre-set limit on federal spending. However, some members of Congress and the presidential administration have raised, and Congress may in the future adopt, proposals intended to reduce Medicaid expenditures such as restructuring the Medicaid program to give states a “block grant” or fixed amount of overall funding for their respective Medicaid programs or to impose spending caps such as per Medicaid beneficiary limits on federal contributions. Reductions in federal funding or changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid could have a significant impact, particularly in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA and especially if federal contributions for Medicaid expansion populations decrease and states are unable to offset the reductions. In addition, some states use or have applied to use Medicaid waivers granted by CMS to implement the ACA’s Medicaid expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. Some of these program variations may reduce the number of current and/or future Medicaid enrollees.

The outcome of the 2024 federal elections, affecting both the executive and legislative branches, increases regulatory uncertainty and the potential for significant policy changes. President Trump has issued executive orders that impact or may impact the healthcare industry, including an order establishing a presidential advisory commission focused on restructuring and streamlining government agencies and reducing or eliminating regulations and federal government programs and other expenditures. Further, some members of Congress and the presidential administration have raised potential measures intended to accelerate the shift from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage or eliminating some or all of the consumer protections established by the ACA.

Components of our Statements of Income

Net Service Revenues

We generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis in our personal care segment, on a daily basis in our hospice segment and on an episodic basis in our home health segment. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers.

In our personal care segment, net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate, which is either contractual or fixed by legislation, and are recognized at the time services are rendered. In our hospice segment, net service revenues are provided based on daily rates for each of the levels of care and are recognized as services are provided. In our home health segment, net service revenues are based on an episodic basis at a stated rate and recognized based on the number of days elapsed during a period of care within the reporting period. We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record revenues.

Cost of Service Revenues

We incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers’ compensation and general liability coverage for our employees. Employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs in certain instances.

38

Table of Contents

General and Administrative Expenses

Our general and administrative expenses include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices. Our agency expenses consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits. Facility costs include rents, utilities, and postage, telephone and office expenses. Our corporate and support center expenses include costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents, provision for credit losses and related facility costs. Expenses related to streamlining our operations such as costs related to terminated employees, termination of professional services relationships, other contract termination costs and asset write-offs are also included in general and administrative expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms. We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-competition agreements, using straight line or accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is reported when incurred and principally consists of interest and unused credit line fees on the credit facility.

Income Tax Expense

All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. Our effective income tax rate was 25.9% and 23.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates was principally due to the inclusion of state taxes, non-deductible compensation, and non-deductible permanent items, partially offset by the use of federal employment tax credits.

Net service revenues increased by 9.1% to $1,154.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1,058.7 million in 2023. Net service revenue increased by $61.9 million, $21.0 million and $13.0 million in our personal care, hospice and home health segments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023. Net service revenue in our personal care segment increased due to a 5.2% increase in revenues per billable hour and a 2.1% increase in billable hours for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in our hospice segment revenue was primarily due to an increase in average daily census and revenue per patient day, mainly attributed to the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. The increase in our home health segment is primarily due to the full-year effect in 2024 of the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023.

Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 32.1% in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit percentage in our personal care and hospice segments of 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, offset by a marginal decline in our home health segment of 0.2%.

General and administrative expenses increased to $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $234.8 million in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the full-year effect of the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $11.7 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, slightly increased to 22.4% for 2024, from 22.2% in 2023.

Depreciation and amortization decreased to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $14.1 million in 2023, primarily due to the decrease of intangible asset amortization related to accelerated amortization and the reduction in amortization expense of tradenames, which were fully amortized, partially offset by the full-year effect in 2024 of our fiscal year 2023 acquisitions and fiscal year 2024 acquisitions.

Total interest expense, net decreased to $7.7 million from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreased amounts held under our credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. Interest income increased $2.9 million due to an increase in cash investment into interest bearing accounts from the Company’s public offering of common stock.

All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. The effective income tax rate was 25.9% and 23.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our higher effective income tax rate in 2024 was due to the increase of non-deductible compensation and non-deductible permanent items, as well as lower benefit from the use of federal employment tax credits. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the non-deductible compensation, non-deductible permanent items, and federal employment tax credits were 0.8% and (1.7)%, respectively.

The personal care segment derives a significant amount of its net service revenues from operations in Illinois, which represented 38.2% and 38.8% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. One payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, accounted for 21.0% and 20.9% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 53.3% and 50.4% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 44.0% and 46.2% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with commercial insurance, private pay and other payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues.

Net service revenues increased by 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in revenues per billable hour of 5.2%, mainly attributed to the rate increases discussed above.

Hospice generates revenue by providing care to patients with a life expectancy of six months or less, as well as related services for their families. Hospice offers four levels of care, as defined by Medicare, to meet the varying needs of patients and their families. The four levels of hospice include routine care, continuous care, general inpatient care and respite care. Our hospice segment principally provides routine care.

Table of Contents

Net service revenues from Medicare accounted for 91.2% and 89.9% and managed care organizations accounted for 3.3% and 3.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net service revenues increased by $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in average daily census and revenue per patient day, mainly attributed to the organic growth and the acquisition of the operations of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023.

Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was relatively consistent at 47.0% and 46.8% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The hospice segment’s general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 24.3% and 25.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to more efficient operations for administrative employees for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Home health generates revenue by providing home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, generally to treat an illness or injury. Net service revenues from Medicare accounted for 69.5% and 72.3% and managed care organizations accounted for 25.2% and 22.2% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Home health services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare HHPPS, which uses national, standardized 30-day period payment rates for periods of care. CMS uses the PDGM as the case-mix classification model to place periods of care into payment categories, classifying patients based on clinical characteristics. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care in which costs exceed a specific threshold amount.

Net service revenues increased by $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. Total visits increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly attributed to the full-year effect of the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023.

Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was relatively consistent at 36.8% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The home health segment’s general and administrative expenses consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, were 25.5% and 24.7% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully evaluated.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, other non-operating income, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructure expenses and other non-recurring costs, gain or loss on the sale of assets, impairment of operating lease assets, retroactive rate increases from New York and the retroactive impact from collective bargaining negotiations. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure used by management that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors, management and others in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:

•
By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that we provide investors with insight and consistency in our financial reporting and present a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period, by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense), asset base (amortization and depreciation), tax consequences, stock-based compensation expense and other identified adjustments.

•
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate the financial performance of other public companies.

•
We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $11.2 million, $10.3 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. By comparing our Adjusted EBITDA in different periods, our investors can evaluate our operating results without stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense which we believe is not a key measure of our operations.

44

Table of Contents

In addition, management has chosen to use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure because we believe that the amount of non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense, may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations, and because such expenses can vary significantly from period to period as a result of new acquisitions, full amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets or the timing of new stock-based awards, as the case may be. This facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results, as well as external comparisons to the operating results of our competitors and other companies in the personal care services industry. Because management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a performance measure, management uses Adjusted EBITDA:

•
as one of our primary financial measures in the day-to-day oversight of our business to allocate financial and human resources across our organization, to assess appropriate levels of marketing and other initiatives and to generally enhance the financial performance of our business;

•
in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as well as for other planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis, including allocations in order to implement our growth strategy, to determine appropriate levels of investments in acquisitions and to endeavor to achieve strong core operating results;

•
to evaluate the effectiveness of business strategies, such as the allocation of resources, the mix of organic growth and acquisitive growth and adjustments to our payor mix;

•
as a means of evaluating the effectiveness of management in directing our core operating performance, which we consider to be performance that can be affected by our management in any particular period through their allocation and use of resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit-generating operations during that period;

•
for the valuation of prospective acquisitions, and to evaluate the effectiveness of integration of past acquisitions into our Company; and

•
in communications with our Board concerning our financial performance.

Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include:

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or interest income;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes;

•
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any acquisition expenses;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any stock-based compensation;

•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any restructure expense and other non-recurring costs; and

•
other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Management compensates for these limitations by using GAAP financial measures in addition to Adjusted EBITDA in managing the day-to-day and long-term operations of our business. We believe that consideration of Adjusted EBITDA, together with a careful review of our GAAP financial measures, is the most informed method of analyzing our Company.

* Management deems Adjusted EBITDA to be a key performance indicator. Management uses key performance indicators to monitor our performance, both in our existing operations and acquisitions. Many of these metrics serve as the basis of reported revenues and assessment of these, provide direct correlation to the results of operations from period to period and facilitate comparison with the results of our peers. Historical trends established in these metrics can be used to evaluate current operating results, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We believe they are useful to investors in evaluating and understanding our business but should not be used solely in assessing the Company’s performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash balances of $98.9 million and $64.8 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes, operating expenses, interest and taxes.

We drew approximately $233.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facility to fund, in part, the purchase price paid in connection with the Gentiva Acquisition and repaid $136.4 million under our revolving credit facility in 2024. At December 31, 2024, we had a total of $223.0 million in revolving loans, with an interest rate of 6.34% outstanding on our credit facility. After giving effect to the amounts drawn on our credit facility, approximately $8.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), we had $577.7 million of capacity and $346.6 million available for borrowing under our credit facility. At December 31, 2023, we had a total of $126.4 million of revolving loans, with an interest rate of 7.21%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company drew approximately $110.0 million on the revolver portion of its credit facility to fund, in part, the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition.

Our credit facility requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio not exceeding 3.75:1.00. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Although we believe our liquidity position remains strong, we can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the covenants in our Credit Agreement, and in the future, it may prove necessary to seek an amendment with the bank lending group under our credit facility. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Public Offering

On June 28, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of an aggregate 1,725,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, including 225,000 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $108.00 per share (the “Public Offering”). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $175.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses of approximately $10.7 million. The Company used approximately $81.4 million from the net proceeds of the Public Offering for the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility and may use any remaining net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes, including the Gentiva Acquisition and any future acquisitions or investments. The Public Offering resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of approximately $175.6 million on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024.

Current Macroeconomic Conditions and American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 Relief Funding

Economic conditions in the United States continue to be challenging in certain respects. For example, the United States economy continues to experience inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates and challenging labor market conditions. Any economic downturn would pose a risk to states’ revenues, which in turn could affect our reimbursements and collections received for services rendered. Depending on the severity and length of any potential economic downturn as well as the extent of any federal support, states could face significant fiscal challenges and revise their revenue forecasts and adjust their budgets, and sales tax collections and income tax withholdings could be depressed.

ARPA Spending Plans

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) provides for $350 billion in relief funding for eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to mitigate the fiscal effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additionally, the law provided for a 10-percentage point increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid HCBS from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022, provided the state satisfied certain conditions. States are generally permitted to use the state funds equivalent to the additional federal funds through March 31, 2025, but CMS has granted extensions to several states. States must use the monies attributable to this matching fund increase to supplement, not supplant, their level of state spending for the implementation of activities enhanced under the Medicaid HCBS in effect as of April 1, 2021.

HCBS spending plans for the additional matching funds vary by state, but common initiatives in which the Company is participating include those aimed at strengthening the provider workforce (e.g., efforts to recruit, retain, and train direct service providers). The Company is required to properly and fully document the use of such funds in reports to the state in which the funds originated. Funds may be subject to recoupment if not expended or if they are expended on non-approved uses.

The Company received state funding provided by the ARPA in an aggregate amount of $15.7 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company utilized $10.2 million and $10.5 million of these funds during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily for caregivers and adding support to recruiting and retention efforts. The deferred portion of ARPA funding was $11.2 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included within Government stimulus advances on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities was $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $112.2 million in 2023 primarily due to the increase in net income offset by a decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in accounts receivable were primarily related to the growth in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as described below. The related receivables due from the Illinois Department on Aging represented 21.7% and 25.8% of net accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents

Net cash used in investing activities was $354.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of $0.4 million for the acquisition of Upstate, $353.5 million for the Gentiva Acquisition, $6.1 million in purchases of property and equipment related to technology infrastructure, offset by $5.4 million in proceeds received on the sale of our New York business. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $1.0 million primarily for the acquisition of CareStaff, $111.2 million for the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care and $9.4 million in purchases of property and equipment primarily related to technology infrastructure.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net cash used in $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 included borrowings of $233.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facility to fund the Gentiva Acquisition, $175.6 million in net proceeds received from the Public Offering and cash received from the exercise of stock options of $3.4 million, offset by $136.4 million payment on the revolver portion of our credit facility and cash paid for debt issuance costs of $3.4 million. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included borrowings of $110.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facility to fund two acquisitions and the payment of $118.5 million of our revolving loans.

Outstanding Accounts Receivable

Gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $126.4 million and $117.8 million, respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable, net of the allowance for credit losses, increased by $7.4 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The open receivable balance from the Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for the Company’s Illinois personal care operation, decreased by $3.1 million from $29.8 million as of December 31, 2023 to $26.7 million as of December 31, 2024. Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.

We calculate our DSO by taking the accounts receivable outstanding, net of the allowance for credit losses, divided by the net service revenues for the last quarter, multiplied by the number of days in that quarter. Our DSOs were 39 days at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The DSOs for our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 40 days and 50 days, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and related disclosures.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty and has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.

Table of Contents

Revenue Recognition, Accounts Receivable and Allowances

Net service revenue is recognized at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services directly to consumers. Receipts are from federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers for services rendered. The Company assesses the consumers’ ability to pay at the time of their admission based on the Company’s verification of the customer’s insurance coverage under the Medicare, Medicaid, and other commercial or managed care insurance programs. Laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which we participate are complex and subject to interpretation. Net service revenues related to uninsured accounts, or self-pay, is recorded net of implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount we expect to collect. Amounts collected from all sources may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions resulting from client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized, pricing differences and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We monitor our net service revenues and collections from these sources and record any necessary adjustment to net service revenues based upon management’s assessment of historical write offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer healthcare coverage and other collection indicators.

Accounts receivable is reduced to the amount expected to be collected in future periods for services rendered to customers prior to the balance sheet date. Management estimates the value of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions based upon historical experience and other factors, including an aging of accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed, current contract and reimbursement terms, shifts in payors and other relevant information. Collection of net service revenues we expect to receive is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the payors within the various filing deadlines. The evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex, subjective judgments impacting the determination of the implicit price concession assumption. In addition, we compare our cash collections to recorded net service revenues and evaluate our historical allowances, including implicit price concessions, based upon the ultimate resolution of the accounts receivable balance.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Under business combination accounting, assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair values and the difference between the consideration transferred, excluding transaction costs, and the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The Company’s significant identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names and trademarks and state licenses. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine initial fair value of its intangible assets, including relief-from-royalty, income approach, discounted cash flow analysis, and multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods over which the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The Company estimates the fair values of the trade names using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions such as the long-term growth rates of future revenues, the relief from royalty rate for such revenue, the tax rate and the discount rate. The Company estimates the fair value of existing indefinite-lived state licenses based on a blended approach of the replacement cost method and cost savings method, which involves estimating the total process costs and opportunity costs to obtain a license, by estimating future earnings before interest and taxes and applying an estimated discount rate, tax rate and time to obtain the license. The Company estimates the fair value of existing finite-lived state licenses based on a method of analyzing the definite revenue streams with the license and without the license, which involves estimating revenues and expenses, estimated time to build up to a current revenue base, which is market specific, and the non-licensed revenue allocation, revenue growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. The Company estimates the fair value of customer and referral relationships based on a multi-period excess earnings method, which involves identifying revenue streams associated with the assets, estimating the attrition rates based upon historical financial data, expenses and cash flows associated with the assets, contributory asset charges, rates of return for specific assets, growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. The Company estimates the fair value of non-competition agreements based on a method of analyzing the factors to compete and factors not to compete, which involves estimating historical financial data, forecasted financial statements, growth rates, tax amortization benefit, discount rate, review of factors to compete and factors not to compete as well as an assessment of the probability of successful enforcement for each non-competition agreement.

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, goodwill was $970.6 million and $663.0 million, respectively, included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of our goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions. In accordance with ASC Topic 350,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We may elect to use a qualitative test to determine whether impairment has occurred, focused on various factors including macroeconomic conditions, market trends, specific reporting unit financial performance and other entity specific events, to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill. We may also bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test. Additionally, it is our policy to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we performed the quantitative analysis to evaluate whether an impairment occurred. Since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, we rely on widely accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value, including discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit. These types of models require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows, industry-specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. The discounted cash flow model uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple model estimates fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Under the discounted cash flow model, the projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit using significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins and the weighted-average cost of capital.

Based on the totality of the information available, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying values. Consequently, we concluded that there were no impairments for the years ended December 31, 2024
, 
2023 or 2022. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions management believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, was $109.6 million and $92.0 million, respectively, included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-competition agreements. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from one to twenty-five years, and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Customer and referral relationships are amortized systematically over the periods of expected economic benefit, which range from five to ten years. We would recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future non-discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset are less than the carrying value. An impairment charge would then be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach. In accordance with ASC Topic 350,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. Amortization of intangible assets is reported in the statement of income caption, “Depreciation and amortization” and not included in the income statement caption cost of service revenues.

Standby Letters of Credit

We had outstanding letters of credit of $8.0 million at December 31, 2024. These standby letters of credit benefit our third-party insurer for our high deductible workers’ compensation insurance program. The amount of the letters of credit is negotiated annually in conjunction with the insurance renewals.

Material Cash Requirements

We believe that our existing cash on hand, our anticipated cash flows from operations and amounts available under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and investing needs for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the effects of risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A—”Risk Factors”

Debt

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding debt on our revolving loan under our credit facility of $223.0 million, payable on July 30, 2028. Interest payments associated with the debt aggregate to $54.5 million, with $15.6 million payable within 12 months. As described in Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, interest on borrowings under the revolving loan are variable. The calculated interest payable amounts use actual rates available through January 2024 and assumes the January rates of 6.34%, for all future interest payable on the revolving loans. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of our long-term debt.

Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for local branches, our corporate headquarters and certain equipment. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations aggregating to $65.0 million, with $15.8 million payable within 12 months. See Note 2, Leases, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of our leases.

The Company sublet a portion of its corporate headquarters space in Frisco, Texas in November 2022 to a third party under a two-year sublease term for a monthly base rent of $0.1 million. The sublease expired in January 2025. As the result, the Company recorded $5.0 million in impairment charges on operating lease assets, included within general administrative expenses. Of the $5.0 million in impairment charges on operating lease assets recorded, $2.2 million in exit charges was included.

Impact of Inflation

The United States has recently experienced high rates of inflation. These inflationary conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased operating costs, particularly as the result of increased wages we have paid and may continue to pay our caregivers and other personnel and our ability to attract and retain personnel. Increased price levels might allow us to increase our fees to private pay clients, but our ability to realize rate increases from government programs might be limited despite inflation. Inflation may also raise our financing costs. For additional information regarding the risks to us from the current competitive labor market and increasing labor costs, see Item 1A—Risk Factors — “
We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or we may incur increased costs in doing so.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA
TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $223.0 million on our credit facility, all of which was subject to variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $126.4 million on our credit facility, all of which was subject to variable interest rates. If the variable rates on this debt were 100 basis points higher than the rate applicable to the borrowing during the year ended December 31, 2024, our net income would have decreased by $0.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. We do not currently have any derivative or hedging arrangements, or other known exposures, to changes in interest rates.

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Under SEC Staff guidance, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting which covers the period in which such acquisition was completed. We excluded 
the personal care business of Curo Health Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that does business as Gentiva (the 
“
Gentiva Acquisition
”
),
 from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because it was acquired in a purchase business combination on December 2, 2024.

•

These acquired operations represented 2.0% of our revenues, 3.0% of our operating income and 2.4% of our assets as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Regi

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Addus HomeCare Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Addus HomeCare Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company
’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the business acquired from Gentiva (the Gentiva Acquisition), from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Gentiva from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Gentiva is a wholly-owned business whose total revenues, total operating income, and total assets excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 2.0%, 3.0%, and 2.4% respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances for Implicit Price Concessions

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, net service revenue is recognized at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services directly to consumers. Amounts collected may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions, resulting from client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized, pricing differences and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Management estimates the value of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions, based upon historical experience and other factors, including an aging of accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed, current contract and reimbursement terms, shifts in payors and other relevant information. The evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex, subjective judgments. Accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions (before the allowance for credit losses) were $126.4 million as of December 31, 2024.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimate.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of accounts receivable, net of implicit price concessions, including controls over the allowance for implicit price concessions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimate of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions; (ii) evaluating the relevance and use of historical experience data as an input into management’s estimate; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying historical collection data used as an input into management’s estimate; (iv) testing, on a sample basis, the accuracy of revenue transactions and cash collections from the billing and collection data used as an input into the estimate; (v) evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s estimate of the amount expected to be collected by performing a retrospective comparison of actual cash collections to the related accounts receivable; and (vi) performing a comparison of the remaining uncollected accounts receivable balance as of a date subsequent to year end, to expected future cash collections based on the Company’s historical collection patterns.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Description of Business
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Addus HomeCare Corporation (“Holdings”) and its subsidiaries (together with Holdings, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). The Company operates as a multi-state provider of 
three
 distinct but related business segments providing in-home services. In its personal care services segment, the Company provides non-medical assistance with activities of daily living, primarily to persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled. In its hospice segment, the Company provides physical, emotional and spiritual care for people who are terminally ill as well as related services for their families. In its home health segment, the Company provides services that are primarily medical in nature to individuals who may require assistance during an illness or after hospitalization and include skilled nursing and physical, occupational and speech therapy. The Company’s payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals.

Principles of Consolidation
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification of Prior Period Balances
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current-year presentation including the reporting of deferred tax liabilities as a separate line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reclassifications have no effect on the reported net income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Net service revenue is recognized at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services directly to consumers. Receipts are from federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers for services rendered. The Company assesses the consumers’ ability to pay at the time of their admission based on the Company’s verification of the customer’s insurance coverage under the Medicare, Medicaid, and other commercial or managed care insurance programs. Laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which the Company participates are complex and subject to interpretation. Net service revenues related to uninsured accounts, or self-pay, is recorded net of implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount the Company expects to collect. Amounts collected from all sources may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions, resulting from client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized, pricing differences and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. The Company monitors our net service revenues and collections from these sources and records any necessary adjustment to net service revenues based upon management’s assessment of historical write offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer healthcare coverage and other collection indicators.
The initial estimate of net service revenues is determined by reducing the standard charge by any contractual adjustments, discounts and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of net service revenues are generally recorded in the period of the change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patient’s ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense.

Table of Contents

Personal Care
The majority of the Company’s net service revenues are generated from providing personal care services directly to consumers under contracts with state, local and other governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a customer relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed at a stated rate. However, the contracts do not give rise to rights and obligations until an order is placed with the Company. When an order is placed, it creates the performance obligation to provide a defined quantity of service hours, or authorized hours, per consumer. The Company satisfies its performance obligations over time, given that consumers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company as the services are performed. As the Company has a right to consideration from customers commensurate with the value provided to customers from the performance completed over a given invoice period, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes patient service revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice.
Hospice Revenue
The Company generates net service revenues from providing hospice services to consumers who are terminally ill as well as related services for their families. Net service revenues are recognized as services are provided and costs for delivery of such services are incurred. The estimated payment rates are daily rates for each of the levels of care the Company delivers. Hospice companies are subject to two specific payment limit caps under the Medicare program each federal fiscal year, the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap. The inpatient cap limits the number of inpatient care days provided to no more than 20% of the total days of hospice care provided to Medicare patients for the year. If a hospice exceeds the number of allowable inpatient care days, the hospice must refund any amounts received for inpatient care that exceed the total of: (i) the product of the total reimbursement paid to the hospice for inpatient care multiplied by the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient days to the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the hospice to Medicare patients; and (ii) the product of the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the limitation multiplied by the routine home care rate. The aggregate cap, which is calculated each federal fiscal year, limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients served. If a hospice’s Medicare payments exceed its aggregate cap, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount. In federal fiscal year 
2025, the aggregate cap is $
34,465.34
. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a liability of
 $
1.7
 million
 and 
$
0.8
 million, respectively, related to the Medicare aggregate cap limit.
Home Health Revenue
The Company also generates net service revenues from providing home healthcare services directly to consumers mainly under contracts with Medicare and managed care organizations. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed on an episodic basis at a stated rate. Home health Medicare services are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System (“HHPPS”), which is based on 30-day periods of care as a unit of service. The HHPPS permits multiple, continuous periods per patient. Medicare payment rates for periods under HHPPS are determined through use of a case-mix classification system, the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”), which assigns patients to resource groups based on a patient’s clinical characteristics.
The Company elects to use the same 30-day periods that Medicare recognizes as standard but accelerates revenue upon discharge to align with a patient’s episode length if less than the expected 30 days, which depicts the transfer of services and related benefits received by the patient over the term of the contract necessary to satisfy the obligations. The Company recognizes revenue based on the number of days elapsed during a period of care within the reporting period. The Company satisfies its performance obligations as consumers receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company as the services are performed. As the Company has a right to consideration from Medicare commensurate with the services provided to customers from the performance completed over a given episodic period, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations. Under this method recognizing revenue ratably over the episode based on beginning and ending dates is a reasonable proxy for the transfer of benefit of the service.

Accounts Receivable and Allowances
Accounts receivable is reduced to the amount expected to be collected in future periods for services rendered to customers prior to the balance sheet date. Management estimates the value of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions, based upon historical experience and other factors, including an aging of accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed, current contract and reimbursement terms, shifts in payors and other relevant information. Collection of net service revenues the Company expects to receive is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the payors within the various filing deadlines. The evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex, subjective judgments impacting the determination of the implicit price concession assumption. In addition, the Company compares its cash collections to recorded net service revenues and evaluates its historical allowance, including implicit price concessions, based upon the ultimate resolution of the accounts receivable balance.
Subsequent adjustments to accounts receivable determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor’s ability to pay are recognized as provision for credit losses. The majority of what historically was classified as provision for credit losses under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into the determination of net service revenues discussed above. Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses balance was 
$
3.5
 million
 and $
2.3
 million, respectively, which is included in accounts receivable, net of allowances for credit losses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 
The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:

Computer equipment

3
-
5 years

Furniture and equipment

-
7 years

Transportation equipment

5
 years

Computer software

Leases
The Company recognizes a lease liability and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on the balance sheet. We have historically entered into operating leases for local branches, our corporate headquarters and certain equipment. The Company’s current leases have expiration dates through 2035. Certain of 
our arrangements have free rent periods and/or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s leases include termination options and renewal options for periods ranging from 
one
 to 
five years
. Renewal options generally are not considered in determining the lease term, and payments associated with the option years are excluded from lease payments unless we are reasonably certain to exercise the renewal option.

F-

Table of Contents

The operating lease liabilities are calculated using the present value of lease payments. If available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.

Operating lease assets are valued based on the initial operating lease liabilities plus any prepaid rent, reduced by tenant improvement allowances. Operating lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 the Company recorded $
5.0
 million, $
13,000
 and $
1.2
 million, respectively, in impairment charges on operating lease assets, included within general administrative expenses. 
Of the $
5.0
 million in impairment charges on operating lease assets recorded, 
$
2.2
 million in exit charges was included.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Under business combination accounting, assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair values and the difference between the consideration transferred, excluding transaction costs, and the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The Company’s significant identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names and trademarks and state licenses. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine initial fair value of its intangible assets, including relief-from-royalty, income approach, discounted cash flow analysis, and multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods over which the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The Company estimates the fair values of the trade names using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions such as the long-term growth rates of future revenues, the relief from royalty rate for such revenue, the tax rate and the discount rate. The Company estimates the fair value of existing indefinite-lived state licenses based on a blended approach of the replacement cost method and cost savings method, which involves estimating the total process costs and opportunity costs to obtain a license, by estimating future earnings before interest and taxes and applying an estimated discount rate, tax rate and time to obtain the license. The Company estimates the fair value of existing finite-lived state licenses based on a method of analyzing the definite revenue streams with the license and without the license, which involves estimating revenues and expenses, estimated time to build up to a current revenue base, which is market specific, and the non-licensed revenue allocation, revenue growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. The Company estimates the fair value of customer and referral relationships based on a multi-period excess earnings method, which involves identifying revenue streams associated with the assets, estimating the attrition rates based upon historical financial data, expenses and cash flows associated with the assets, contributory asset charges, rates of return for specific assets, growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. The Company estimates the fair value of non-competition agreements based on a method of analyzing the factors to compete and factors not to compete, which involves estimating historical financial data, forecasted financial statements, growth rates, tax amortization benefit, discount rate, review of factors to compete and factors not to compete as well as an assessment of the probability of successful competition for each non-competition agreement.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, goodwill was $
970.6
 million and $
663.0
 million, respectively, included on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s carrying value of goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company may elect to use a qualitative test to determine whether impairment has occurred, focused on various factors including macroeconomic conditions, market trends, specific reporting unit financial performance and other entity specific events, to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company may also bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test. Additionally, it is the Company’s policy to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference.

F-

Table of Contents

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company performed the quantitative analysis to evaluate whether an impairment occurred. Since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, the Company relies on widely accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value, including discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit. These types of models require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows, industry-specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. The discounted cash flow model uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple model estimates fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Under the discounted cash flow model, the projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit using significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins and the weighted-average cost of capital.

Based on the totality of the information available, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying values. Consequently, the Company concluded that there were 
no
 impairments for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions management believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, was $
109.6
 million and $
92.0
 million, respectively, included on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-competition agreements. Definite-lived intangible assets are
 amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from 
one
 to 
twenty-five years
, and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Customer and referral relationships are amortized systematically over the periods of expected economic benefit, which range from 
five
 to 
ten years
. The Company would recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future non-discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset are less than the carrying value. An impairment charge would then be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The Company 
estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. 
No
 impairment charge was recorded for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022
. Amortization of intangible assets is reported in the statement of income caption, “Depreciation and amortization” and not included in the income statement caption cost of service revenues.

Debt Issuance Costs
The Company amortizes debt issuance costs on a straight-line method over the term of the related debt. This method approximates the effective interest method. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, 
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
, the Company has classified the debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related liability.
Workers’ Compensation Program
The Company’s workers’ compensation insurance program ha
s a $
0.4
 mil
lion deductible component. The Company recognizes its obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis. The future claims payments related to the workers’ compensation program are secured by letters of credit. These letters of credit tot
aled $
8.0
 million at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company monitors its claims quarterly and adjusts its reserves as necessary in the current period. These costs are recorded primarily as cost of services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded
 $
13.6
 million
 and $
12.0
 million, respectively, in accrued workers’ compensation insurance on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded
 $
0.8
 million
 and 
$
0.6
 million, respectively, in workers’ compensation insurance receivables. The workers’ compensation insurance receivable is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Interest Expense
Interest expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred and consists of interest and unused credit line fees on the credit facility.

Table of Contents

Income Tax Expense
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes.
 The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC Topic 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties within operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Uncertain tax positions are immaterial for all periods presented.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company currently has 
one
 stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “A&R 2017 Plan”), under which new grants of stock-based employee compensation are made. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, 
Stock Compensation
. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis under the A&R 2017 Plan over the vesting period of the equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the options and restricted stock awards. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value the Company’s options. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Stock-based compensation expense was 
$
11.2
 million
, $
10.3
 million and $
10.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively, included within general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Diluted Net Income Per Common Share
Diluted net income per common share, calculated on the treasury stock method, is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s outstanding securities that may potentially dilute the common stock are stock options and restricted stock awards.
Included in the Company’s calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately 
406,000
 stock options outstanding, of which approximately 
259,000
 were dilutive. In addition, there were approximately 
244,000
 restricted stock awards outstanding, of which approximately 
115,000
 were dilutive for the year ended 
December 31, 2024.
Included in the Company’s calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2023
 were approximately 
455,000
 stock options outstanding, of which approximately 
234,000
 were dilutive. In addition, there were approximately 
201,000
 restricted stock awards outstanding, of which approximately 
82,000
 were dilutive for the year ended 
December 31, 2023.
Included in the Company’s calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 
468,000
 stock options outstanding, of which approximately 
248,000
 were dilutive. In addition, there were approximately 
210,000
  restricted stock awards outstanding, of which approximately 
72,000
 were dilutive for the year ended 
December 31, 2022
.
Use of Estimates
The financial statements are prepared by management in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and include estimated amounts and certain disclosures based on assumptions about future events. The Company’s critical accounting estimates include the following areas: revenue recognition, goodwill and intangibles and business combinations and when required, the quantitative assessment of goodwill. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables and debt. The carrying amounts reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates fair value based on instruments with similar terms using level 2 inputs as defined under ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
.

Table of Contents

The Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill, if required, and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also when determining the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. To determine the fair value in these situations, the Company uses Level 3 inputs, under ASC Topic 820 and defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as discounted cash flows, or if available, what a market participant would pay on the measurement date.
The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine fair value of its intangible assets, including relief-from-royalty, income approach, discounted cash flow analysis, and multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods over which the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables.
Going Concern
In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt as to the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the issuance, of the financial statements. Based on the evaluation, we believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require, among other things, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a description of other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss) by reportable segment, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU was adopted in this annual report by including significant segment expenses reviewed by the Company’s CODM, but did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Refer to Note 14, Segment Information, for the updated presentation.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU was 
adopted
 prospectively on 
January 1, 2023
. The additional disclosures required did 
no
t have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, and other transactions subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The ASU provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. Therefore, it was in effect for a limited time through December 31, 2022. The ASU was 
adopted
 as of 
January 1, 2023
 and did 
no
t have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or liquidity. As discussed further in Note 9 and pursuant to the Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 26, 2023, the Company amended its credit facility to replace LIBOR with the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) as the benchmark reference rate for loans under its credit facility. The transition to SOFR did not and is 
no
t expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or liquidity.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and allows for early adoption. These requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and will expand income tax disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The new guidance is intended to provide investors more detailed disclosures around specific types of expenses. The new disclosures require certain details for expenses presented on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as selling expenses to be presented in the notes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The disclosure updates are required to be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. The Company is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting the updated provisions.

5. Divestiture
Effective May 20, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to sell all of the Company’s New York operations for a purchase price of up to $
23.0
 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments for future operating requirements (the “New York Asset Sale”). The purchase price of up to $
23.0
 million includes 
50
% cash consideration, paid out as an initial payment of $
4.6
 million, $
6.9
 million paid pro rata as a deferred payment as caregivers are transferred and 
50
% in the form of contingent consideration for the Company’s CDPAP business.  The Company entered into a consulting agreement with the purchaser effective May 20, 2024, as the transfer of clients and caregivers and payment for assets pursuant to the New York Asset Sale is occurring over time as regulatory approvals are received, coordination of the transfer of clients and caregivers occurs, and the change of control takes place. The Company determined that the consulting agreement gave it the ability to control the business.
In October 2024, the Company determined that it no longer controlled the business as it transferred more than 
50
% of the clients and caregivers and therefore qualified for sale consideration of the New York Asset Sale. As a result, the Company deconsolidated the results of its New York operations and recorded a gain on divestiture of $
3.7
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The gain is reflected within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

Table of Contents

In connection with this transaction, the Company will cease operations in New York. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded 
$
1.7
 millio
n in consulting fees and received a $
4.6
 million initial payment on the acquisition and deferred payments of $
0.8
 million, totaling $
5.4
 million related to the pro rata portion of caregivers transferred to purchaser. The remaining $
6.1
 million due from the seller as of December 31, 2024 is reflected within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. No amount was recorded related to the CDPAP business contingent consideration.

The New York Asset Sale did not qualify as a discontinued operation because it did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operation or financial results.

Goodwill and intangible assets of $
2.9
 million and $
4.2
 million, respectively were derecognized in connection with the divestiture.

Goodwill adjustments to previously recorded goodwill are generally related to accounts receivable and accrued expenses based on the final valuations. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions made by the Company in 2023 and 2024, and Note 5 for additional information regarding the divestiture for New York Asset Sale.

The Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names and trademarks, non-competition agreements and state licenses. Amortization is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from

one
 to 
twenty-five years
. Customer and referral relationships are amortized systematically over the periods of expected economic benefit, which range from 
five
 to 
ten years
.
Goodwill and certain state licenses are not amortized pursuant to ASC Topic 350. We test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow model as well as a market multiple model. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on the Company’s estimate of a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital. These models are both based on the Company’s best estimate of future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to the Company’s consolidated market capitalization, with consideration of the amount a potential acquirer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for each reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, the most recent price of the Company’s common stock and fair value of long term debt, estimates of future re
venue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested capital. Significant assumptions used in the analysis included a 
9.0
% discount rate and a 
3.5
% long-term revenue growth rate. The Company did

Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility
On October 31, 2018, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with certain lenders and Capital One, National Association, as a lender and as agent for all lenders, as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 12, 2019, as further amended by the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2021, as further amended by the Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2023 (as described below, the “Third Amendment”), and as further amended by the Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2024 (as described below, the “Fourth Amendment”) (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”, as used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “credit facility” shall mean the credit facility evidenced by the Credit Agreement). The credit facility consists of a $
650.0
 million revolving credit facility and a $
150.0
 million incremental loan facility, which incremental loan facility may be for term loans or an increase to the revolving loan commitments. The maturity of this credit facility is 
July 30, 2028
.

Table of Contents

 On April 26, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to replace LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the benchmark reference rate for loans under its credit facility. The Third Amendment did not amend any other terms of the Credit Agreement. The transition to SOFR did not and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or liquidity.
On October 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to, among other things, (a) increase the Company’s revolving credit facility to an aggregate amount of $
650.0
 million, (b) increase the Company’s incremental loan facility to an aggregate amount of $
150.0
 million, and (c) extend the maturity date of the credit facility from July 30, 2026 to 
July 30, 2028
.
Interest on the credit facility may be payable at (x) the sum of (i) an applicable margin ranging from 
0.75
% to 
1.50
% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio plus (ii) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate,” (b) the sum of the federal funds rate plus a margin of 
0.50
% and (c) the sum of Term SOFR (as published by the CME Group Benchmark Administrative Limited) for an interest period of one month for such applicable day (not to be less than 
0.00
%), plus a margin of 
1.00
% or (y) the sum of (i) an applicable margin ranging from 
1.75
% to 
2.50
% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio plus (ii) the rate per annum equal to the sum of Term SOFR (as published by the CME Group Benchmark Administrative Limited) for the applicable interest period (not to be less than 
0.00
%). Swing loans may not be SOFR loans.
Addus HealthCare, Inc. (“Addus HealthCare”) is the borrower, and its parent, Holdings, and substantially all of Holdings’ subsidiaries are guarantors under this credit facility, and it is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of the Company’s and the other credit parties’ current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrower and subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company with respect to liens, indebtedness, guaranties, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions and dispositions of assets. The availability of additional draws under this credit facility is conditioned, among other things, upon (after giving effect to such draws) the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not exceeding 
3.75
:1.00. In certain circumstances, in connection with a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Company can elect to increase its Total Net Leverage Ratio compliance covenant to 
4.25
:1.00 for the then current fiscal quarter and the three succeeding fiscal quarters.
The Company pays a fee ranging from 
0.20
% to 
0.35
% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio times the unused portion of the revolving loan portion of the credit facility.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and a requirement to stay below a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement also contains restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (provided that Addus HealthCare may make distributions to the Company in an amount that does not exceed $
10.0
 million in any year absent of an event of default, plus limited exceptions for tax and administrative distributions), a restriction on the ability to consummate acquisitions (without the consent of the lenders) under its credit facility subject to compliance with the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) thresholds, restrictions on mergers, dispositions of assets, and affiliate transactions, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024
, the Company (i) drew approximately $
233.0
 million under its credit facility to fund, in part, the Gentiva Acquisition and (ii) repaid $
136.4
 million under the revolving credit facility. At 
December 31, 2024, the Company had a total of $
223.0
 million of revolving loans, with an interest rate of

6.34
%
, outstanding on its credit facility. After giving effect to the amount drawn on its credit facility, approximately $
8.0
 million of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Company had $
577.7
 million of capacity and $
346.6
 million available for borrowing under its credit facility.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company drew approximately $
110.0
 million under its credit facility to fund, in part, the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a total of $
126.4
 million of revolving loans, with an interest rate of

Management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers all available evidence in making this assessment.

%, 
23.1
% and 
23.5
% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates was principally due to the inclusion of state taxes, non-deductible compensation, and non-deductible permanent items, partially offset by the use of federal employment tax credits.

The Company is subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 
2021 through 2023
 and for various state authorities for the years 
2019 through 2023
.

11. Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards
The Board approved the A&R 2017 Plan as of April 13, 2023 and our shareholders approved it as of June 14, 2023. The A&R 2017 Plan amended and restated our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”), which in turn was intended to replace our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). All awards are now granted from the A&R 2017 Plan. Outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan will continue to be governed by the 2009 Plan and the agreements under which they were granted.
The A&R 2017 Plan allows us to grant performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards (each, an “Award”) to eligible employees, directors and consultants in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”), Restricted Stock Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards and Other Stock Unit Awards. The Board believes that the A&R 2017 Plan is necessary to continue the Company’s effectiveness in attracting, motivating and retaining employees, directors and consultants with appropriate experience and to increase the grantees’ alignment of interest with the Company’s shareholders.
Under the A&R 2017 Plan, Awards may be made in shares of our common stock. Subject to adjustment as provided by the terms of the A&R 2017 Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the A&R 2017 Plan is 
864,215
, comprised of 
274,215
 shares (the number of shares that were available for issuance under the 2017 Plan as of April 13, 2023) and 
590,000
 shares (the number of shares newly authorized by the Company’s shareholders upon their approval of the A&R 2017 Plan).. The aggregate awards granted during any calendar year to any single Participant cannot exceed 
500,000
 shares subject to stock options or SARs. These individual annual limitations are cumulative in that any shares of common stock or cash for which Awards are permitted to be granted to a Participant during a fiscal year are not covered by an Award in that fiscal year (such shortfall, the “Shortfall Amount”), the number of shares of common stock (or amount of cash, as the case may be) will automatically increase in the subsequent fiscal years during the term of the A&R 2017 Plan until the earlier of the time when the Shortfall Amount has been granted to the Participant, or the end of the third fiscal year following the year to which such Shortfall Amount relates. 
At December 31, 2024, there were 
707,772
 shares of common stock available for future grant under the A&R 2017 Plan.

F-
26

Table of Contents

Awards made under the 2017 Plan (and the 2009 Plan) that are forfeited, canceled, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares to a Participant will be deemed available for Awards under the A&R 2017 Plan; provided, that the A&R 2017 Plan explicitly prohibits shares withheld for payment of taxes for awards, the exercise price for appreciation awards, shares acquired with the proceeds of appreciation awards, and shares from stock settled SARs from being added back to the share reserve. Stock options are awarded with an exercise price equal to the fair market value based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Options granted typically vest over a service period ranging from three to four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted shares typically vest over a service period ranging from one to four years and expire ten years from date of grant.

12. Employee Benefit Plans
The 401(k) retirement plan is a defined contribution plan that provides for matching contributions by the Company to all non-union employees. Matching contributions are discretionary and subject to change by management. Under the provisions of the 401(k) plan, employees can contribute up to the maximum percentage and limits allowable under the U.S. Revenue Code. The Company provided contributions totalin

13. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is subject to legal and/or administrative proceedings incidental to its business.
It is the opinion of management that the outcome of pending legal and/or administrative proceedings will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income.
Concentration of Cash
The Company owns financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, including cash. The Company maintains cash with financial institutions which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.

14. Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of a company that engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision makers (“CODM”
). The Company identifies its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer together as CODM to assess the performance of the individual segments and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The Company operates as a multi-state provider of 
three
 business segments providing in-home services.
In its personal care segment, the Company provides non-medical assistance with activities of daily living, primarily to persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled. In its hospice segment, the Company provides physical, emotional and spiritual care for people who are terminally ill as well as related services for their families. In its home health segment, the Company provides services that are primarily medical in nature to individuals who may require assistance during an illness or after hospitalization and include skilled nursing and physical, occupational and speech therapy.

F-
28

Table of Contents

The Company’s method for measuring profitability on each reportable segment basis is the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and its CODM frequently reviews the actual result to budget variance to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.

The CODM does not review disaggregated assets by segment. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.
The tables below set forth information about the Company’s reportable segments, including significant expenses, for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The selection process for the New York Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (“CDPAP”) fiscal intermediaries has changed significantly in recent years and the program continues to be an area of focus for New York governmental authorities. As a result of the changes and uncertainty in the state, the Company determined that its New York personal care operations no longer fit its growth strategy and is divesting these operations. See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Divestiture

for additional details regarding our divestiture.

With the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care in 2023, the Company expanded its home health services to patients in the state of Tennessee.
A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue and accounts receivable is derived from services performed for state and local governmental agencies. We derive a significant amount of our net service revenues in Illinois, which represented 
43.7
%, 
44.5
% and 
43.8
% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for the Company’s Illinois personal care operations, accounted for 
21.0
%, 
20.9
% and 
20.7
% of the Company’s net service revenues for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The related receivables due from the Illinois Department on Aging represented 
21.7
% 
and 
25.8
% of the Company’s net accounts receivable at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In 2019, New York initiated a new RFO process to competitively procure CDPAP fiscal intermediaries. The Company was not selected in the initial RFO process. We submitted a formal protest in response to the selection process, which was filed and accepted in March 2021. 
The New York fiscal year 2023 state budget, passed in April 2022, amended the Fiscal Intermediary RFO process to authorize all fiscal intermediaries that submitted an RFO application and served at least 200 clients in New York City or 50 clients in other counties between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020 to contract with the New York State Department of Health and continue to operate in all counties contained in their application, if the fiscal intermediary submitted an attestation and supporting information to the New York State Department of Health no later than November 29, 2022. The Company submitted an attestation on November 22, 2022, which allowed the Company to continue its CDPAP fiscal intermediary operations. However, the Company decided at that time to suspend materially all of its new fee-for-service patient admissions in the CDPAP through County Social Service Departments. On June 6, 2023, the New York State Department of Health notified the Company that it had received a contract award, under which the Company provided services during 2023 and 2024. The CDPAP continues to be targeted for changes by New York governmental authorities, however. For example, the governor’s most recent update on the state budget contained proposals that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to participate in the CDPAP. See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Divestiture, for additional details regarding our divestiture of our operations in New York, including CDPAP operations.

16. ARPA Spending Plans
In recognition of the significant threat to the liquidity of financial markets and challenges to healthcare providers posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve and Congress took dramatic actions to provide liquidity to businesses and the banking system in the United States and to assist healthcare providers, including through relief legislation such as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”). The ARPA provides for $
350
 billion in relief funding for eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to mitigate the fiscal effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additionally, the law provides for a 10-percentage point increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid home and community-based services (“HCBS”) from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022, provided the state satisfied certain conditions. States are permitted to use the state funds equivalent to the additional federal funds through March 31, 2025. States must use the monies attributable to this matching fund increase to supplement, not supplant, their level of state spending for the implementation of activities enhanced under the Medicaid HCBS in effect as of April 1, 2021.

Table of Contents

HCBS spending plans for the additional matching funds vary by state, but common initiatives in which the Company is participating include those aimed at strengthening the provider workforce (e.g., efforts to recruit, retain, and train direct service providers). The Company is required to properly and fully document the use of such funds in reports to the state in which the funds originated. Funds may be subject to recoupment if not expended or if they are expended on non-approved uses.
The Company received state funding provided by the ARPA in an aggregate amount o
f $
15.7
 million a
nd $
3.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company u
tilized $
10.2
 million and $
10.5
 million of these funds during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, pri
marily for caregivers and adding support to recruiting and retention efforts. The deferred portion of ARPA funding
 was $
11.2
 million and $
5.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included within Government stimulus advances on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
