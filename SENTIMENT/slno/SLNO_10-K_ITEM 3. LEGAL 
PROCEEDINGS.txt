ITEM 3. LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS

We may, from time to time, be party to litigation and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, third parties may, from time to time, assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We currently believe that these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Market Information

Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SLNO”. Our March 2022 common warrants, May 2023 Tranche B warrants, and October 2023 pre-funded warrants are not traded on a national securities exchange.

As of February 26, 2025, there were 33 shareholders of record for our common stock. A substantially greater number of stockholders may be “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.

Dividend Policy

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock, and currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These statements are often identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “estimate,” “plan,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors,” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report. The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent our views as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases. We have submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our lead product candidate, diazoxide choline extended-release tablets (DCCR) for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in individuals four years and older who have hyperphagia. On August 27, 2024, we announced that the FDA had accepted the NDA for filing, designated the application for priority review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 27, 2024. On November 26, 2024, we announced that the FDA had extended the review period for our NDA and set a new PDUFA target action date of March 27, 2025. DCCR previously received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast-Track designations in the United States (U.S.) and Orphan Drug designations in the U.S. and European Union (E.U.).

Financial overview

Summary

We have not generated net income from operations to date, and at December 31, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of $452.3 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We may not receive marketing approval or be successful in commercializing DCCR. Accordingly, we expect to incur significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $87.9 million and marketable securities of $230.7 million.

Revenue recognition

To date, we have earned no revenue from the commercial development and sale of DCCR.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred by contract research organizations (CROs) associated with our clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) associated with the manufacture of our drug product, employee related expenses, including salaries and benefits, and professional consultant costs. These expenses will vary with the cadence and success of DCCR progressing from clinical to commercial stage.

62

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, insurance, rent, pre-commercial activities, and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, reflecting an expanding infrastructure, an increase in pre-commercial activities, other administrative expenses, and increased professional fees associated with being a public reporting company.

Change in fair value of contingent consideration

Change in fair value of contingent consideration represents the change in the fair value of the additional consideration that we expect to pay to the former Essentialis stockholders in accordance with the terms of our 2017 merger agreement with Essentialis based on our assessment of the expected likelihood of achieving two commercial sales milestones of $100.0 million in revenue and $200.0 million in revenue related to DCCR in future years.

Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net is comprised of interest income, and recently interest expense from our loan and security agreement with Oxford Financing LLC and its affiliates (collectively, Oxford), and the change in the fair value of the 2018 PIPE common stock warrant liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our audited financial statements contained herein.

Marketable Securities

We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale and records such assets at estimated fair value in the balance sheets, with unrealized gains and non-credit related losses that are determined to be temporary, if any, reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We classify marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than three months but less than one year as marketable securities, and those with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and recorded as interest income and were immaterial for all periods presented. To the extent the amortized cost basis of the available-for-sale debt securities exceeds the fair value, management assesses the debt securities for credit loss; however, management considers the risk of credit loss to be minimized by our policy of investing in financial instruments issued by highly-rated financial institutions. When assessing the risk of credit loss, management considers factors such as the severity and the reason of the decline in value (i.e., any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency or other adverse conditions specifically related to the security) and management's intended holding period and time horizon for selling. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not recognize any credit losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities. Further, as of December 31, 2024, we did not record an allowance for credit losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities. During 2023 and 2022, we did not hold any marketable securities.

Research and development expenses

63

Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonus, stock-based compensation, consultant fees, certain facility costs and other costs associated with clinical trials and the manufacture of our drug product. Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with CROs and other vendors. Invoicing from CROs and CMOs for services performed can often occur several months later. We accrue the costs incurred for clinical trial activities as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. For other services, we accrue the costs in connection with third-party contractor activities based on our estimate of fees and costs associate with the contract that were rendered during the period and they are expensed as incurred.

Costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use are expensed to research and development costs when incurred.

Stock-based compensation expense

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors and consultants are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award. For restricted stock units this fair value is based on our common stock price on the grant date. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period for service-based awards. For performance-based awards the requisite service period is the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share of common stock could have been significantly different. These assumptions include:

•
Volatility:
 The estimated volatility rate is based on the volatilities of our common stock for a historical period equal to the expected life of the stock options. 

•
Expected life:
 The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected life of our service-based stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified method”, based on the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period. The expected life for the performance-based options was determined based on consideration of the contractual term of the stock options, an estimate of the date the performance criteria would be met and expectations of employee behavior.

•
Risk-free interest rate:
 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the stock options. 

•
Dividend rate:
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. 

We account for forfeitures as they occur.

Contingent consideration

Contingent consideration elements of a business combination are recorded in accordance with ASC 805 which provides that, when contingent consideration terms provide for future payment obligations, the obligation is measured at its fair value on the acquisition date, and the subsequent increase or decrease of the value of the estimated amounts of contingent consideration to be paid is be recognized as expense or income, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Our agreement to pay the former Essentialis stockholders for achieving certain commercial milestones resulted in the recognition of contingent consideration, which was recorded at the inception of the transaction, and subsequent changes to estimate the amount of contingent consideration to be paid is recognized as expenses or income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the contingent

64

consideration is based on our analysis of the likelihood of the drug indication being approved by the FDA and then reaching the cumulative revenue milestones.

Common Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for warrants in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815 
Derivatives and Hedging
. We classify common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivative financial instruments as equity if the contracts (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We classify any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control), (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (iii) contain reset provisions, as either an asset or a liability. We assess classification of freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required. We determined that certain freestanding derivatives, which principally consist of the 2018 PIPE Warrants, do not satisfy the criteria for classification as equity instruments due to the existence of certain cash settlement features that are not within our sole control or variable settlement provision that cause them to not be indexed to our stock.

We classified the 2018 PIPE Warrants at their fair value and re-measured them at each balance sheet date until they were exercised or expired. Any changes in the fair value were recognized as Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The 2018 PIPE Warrants expired in December 2023.

Income Taxes

We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We have provided a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.

We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.

We account for uncertainty in income taxes as required by the provisions of ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.

In addition, the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event that we have had a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted. For more information, see the section titled “Our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes will be limited.” at Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

Revenue

We have not commenced commercialization of DCCR, our current sole novel therapeutic drug candidate, and accordingly, through December 31, 2024, have generated no revenue.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses were $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $33.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $53.4 million from $25.2 million in 2023, which included $2.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. Personnel and associated headcount costs increased $6.4 million as we hired additional employees in support of our research and development and potential commercialization activities. Costs in support of our NDA submission increased $9.0 million and supply chain and related activities increased $6.5 million in preparation for commercial launch. The cadence of our research and development expenditures will fluctuate depending upon the state of our clinical programs, the timing of manufacturing and other projects necessary to support the submission of an NDA and prepare for commercial launch. The $31.3 million of additional non-cash stock-based compensation being recognized in the period is predominantly due to performance-based RSU grants which partially vested upon the acceptance by the FDA of the NDA submission and will fully vest upon the approval of our NDA by the FDA.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $66.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, an increase of $92.4 million from $13.5 million in 2023, which included $3.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. Personnel costs including hiring expense and other associated headcount costs increased $10.7 million as we have hired additional employees in preparation for commercial launch and in support of our increased business activities. New program costs associated with preparation for commercial launch, including disease state education, analytics, other marketing programs, medical affairs and patient advocacy activities, totaled $15.8 million and professional services and consulting costs increased $2.9 million. The $62.7 million of additional non-cash stock-based compensation being recognized in the period is predominantly due to performance-based RSU grants which partially vested upon acceptance by the FDA of the NDA submission and will fully vest upon approval of our NDA by the FDA. General and administrative expenses will increase in support of commercializing DCCR if we receive FDA approval.

66

Change in fair value of contingent consideration

We are obligated to make cash payments of up to a maximum of $21.2 million to the former Essentialis stockholders upon the achievement of certain future commercial milestones associated with the sales of DCCR in accordance with the terms of our 2017 merger agreement with Essentialis. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payable by us achieving two commercial sales milestones of $100 million and $200 million in revenue, respectively, in future years was estimated to be $14.8 million as of December 31, 2024, a $3.2 million increase from the estimate as of December 31, 2023.

Other income (expense), net

We had other income (expense), net of $11.8 million, an increase of $9.4 million from $2.4 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenue

We have not commenced commercialization of DCCR, our current sole novel therapeutic drug candidate, and accordingly, through December 31, 2023, had generated no revenue.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses were $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $9.9 million from $15.3 million in 2022. The increase is primarily due to increased spending in clinical trials and manufacturing efforts, and expenditures in support of an NDA submission.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.6 million from $9.8 million in 2022. The increase was primarily related to higher stock-based compensation expense, higher costs as a result of an increase in headcount, and higher professional and consulting expenses in 2023.

67

Change in fair value of contingent consideration

We are obligated to make cash payments of up to a maximum of $21.2 million to the former Essentialis stockholders upon the achievement of certain future commercial milestones associated with the sales of DCCR in accordance with the terms of our 2017 merger agreement with Essentialis. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payable by us achieving two commercial sales milestones of $100 million and $200 million in revenue, respectively, in future years was estimated to be $11.5 million as of December 31, 2023, a $2.7 million increase from the estimate as of December 31, 2022.

Other income (expense), net

We had other income (expense), net of $2.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million from $0.3 million in 2022. Interest income during 2023 was $2.3 million higher than in 2022, partially offset by a decrease in fair value of the 2018 PIPE Warrants of $0.2 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We used $69.1 million of cash in operating activities and had a net loss of $175.9 million during 2024. We had an accumulated deficit of $452.3 million at December 31, 2024 as a result of having incurred losses since our inception. We had $87.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $230.7 million of marketable securities, and $275.1 million of working capital as of December 31, 2024 and we had lease obligations totaling $3.0 million to be paid through August 2029, consisting of two operating leases for office space in Redwood City, California, one of which terminates in May 2025.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $50.0 million outstanding under our loan and security agreement with Oxford. Under the terms of the loan agreement with Oxford, an additional $100 million may become available in three additional tranches, with tranches of $50 million and $25 million contingent upon FDA approval of DCCR for the treatment of PWS and one tranche of $25 million contingent upon certain commercial milestones. A final $50 million may be made available upon mutual consent with Oxford. The loan carries an interest-only period of 48 months and a total term of 60 months; provided that if specific milestones are achieved prior to September 30, 2026, the interest-only period and maturity date will be extended by 12 months. The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to, subject to certain conditions, (a) 1-month term SOFR plus (b) 5.50%.

Prior to entering into the Oxford loan and security agreement, we had historically financed our operations principally through issuance of equity securities. In May 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $46.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were $158.7 million, before deducting the underwriter discount and other offering expenses of $9.7 million. In July 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement
SM  
with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent (Jefferies), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million.

In October 2023, we announced the closing of the underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering of $20.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were $69.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses. We also announced the closing shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants in a concurrent private offering pursuant to the securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including entities affiliated with existing stockholders, at a price per share of common stock equal to the public offering price of $20.00 and a price per pre-funded warrant of $19.99, for gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million.

In December 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement providing for the sale of up to $60.0 million in warrants and the common stock issuable upon the exercise thereof. Through December 31, 2024, we have received $10.0 million from the sale of these warrants and $44.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of certain of these warrants. Warrants with an aggregate exercise price of $5.2 million are still outstanding.

We expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may require additional capital to penetrate markets for the sale of our product, and pursue product development initiatives. We believe that our

68

existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet the company's working capital needs for the next 12 months. Our long term-term capital requirements will depend on several factors, most notably the timing of the potential approval and commercialization of DCCR. We believe that we will continue to have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means, but the access to such capital resources is uncertain and is not assured. In the future, if we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our commercial launch activities and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to commercialize our products, which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations.

During 2024, operating activities used net cash of $69.1 million, which was primarily due to the loss of $175.9 million which included $100.0 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.4 million of non-cash lease expense, non-cash expense of $3.2 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and $4.9 million added back for accretion of premium/discount on marketable securities. Additionally, there was a $6.1 million net decrease usage of cash during 2024 due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.

During 2023, operating activities used net cash of $24.9 million, which was primarily due to the loss of $39.0 million which included $5.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash expense of $2.7 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration, $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.3 million of non-cash lease expense, and $0.2 million for the change in fair value of common stock warrant liability. Additionally, there was a $3.0 million net decrease usage of cash during 2023 due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.

During 2022, operating activities used net cash of $20.8 million, which was primarily due to the loss of $24.1 million which included non-cash income of $0.7 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration, adjusted for non-cash expense of $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization, and $0.3 million of non-cash lease expense. Additionally, there was a $0.8 million net increase usage of cash during 2022 due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Cash used in investing activities

During 2024, we used $356.5 million for purchases of marketable securities and $0.2 million for purchases of property and equipment. We received proceeds of $131.0 million from maturities of marketable securities.

During 2023, there were no investing activities and minimal cash used during 2022 for the costs of acquiring property and equipment.

Cash provided by financing activities

During 2024, we received $149.0 million from the sale of common stock, net of issuance costs, $49.9 million from issuance of debt, net of issuance costs, and $12.9 million from the exercise of common stock and pre-funded stock warrants. We also received $1.3 million from the exercise of stock options.

During 2023, we received $43.1 million from the sale and issuance of the warrants and $129.0 million gross proceeds from the sale of common stock. We also received $9.3 million of net cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants and $7.1 million of net cash proceeds through an at-the-market offering program. The total net proceeds amount was slightly offset by payments for the taxes from net share-settled vesting of restricted stock units.

During 2022, we received $13.8 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of issuance costs. We also received $0.3 million of net cash proceeds through an at-the-market offering program. The total net proceeds amount was slightly offset by payments for the taxes from net share-settled vesting of restricted stock units.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC.

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments, including cash equivalents, are in the form, or may be in the form of, money market funds or marketable securities and are or may be invested in U.S. Treasury or corporate debt.

As of December 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $87.9 million and $230.7 million of marketable securities held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe we do not have material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, will reduce future interest income.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of

Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Soleno Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of a material weakness.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s acquisition-related purchase price contingent liability, which is estimated using scenario-based methods based upon the Company’s analysis of the likelihood of obtaining specified approvals from the Federal Drug Administration as well as reaching cumulative revenue milestones, is remeasured to its estimated fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

72

Auditing the valuation of the acquisition-related contingent consideration liability was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the Company’s projected future sales, which are affected by expectations about approval of a New Drug Application and future industry, market or economic conditions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

Addressing this matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included, among others:

•
We assessed the terms of the arrangement 

•
With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used by management. This included testing the completeness, accuracy, relevance and reliability of the market data inputs and evaluating the significant assumptions for reasonableness.

•
We evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures related to the fair value of contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements.

Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.

December 31, 2024

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

Note 1. Overview

Soleno Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company or Soleno) is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases. The Company has submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its lead product candidate, diazoxide choline extended-release tablets (DCCR) for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in individuals four years and older who have hyperphagia. On August 27, 2024, the Company announced that the FDA had accepted the NDA for filing, designated the application for priority review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 27, 2024. On November 26, 2024, the Company announced that the FDA had extended the review period for the NDA and set a new PDUFA target action date of March 27, 2025.  DCCR previously received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast-Track designations in the United States (U.S.) and Orphan Drug designations in the U.S. and European Union (E.U.).

The Company incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 25, 1999, and is located in Redwood City, California. It initially established its operations as Capnia, a diversified healthcare company that developed and commercialized innovative diagnostics, devices and therapeutics addressing unmet medical needs. During 2017, the Company merged with Essentialis, Inc. (Essentialis) and subsequently received stockholder approval to amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change its name from “Capnia, Inc.” to “Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.”. Essentialis was a privately held clinical-stage company focused on the development of breakthrough medicines for the treatment of rare diseases where there is increased mortality and risk of cardiovascular and endocrine complications. After the merger, the Company’s primary focus has been the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases and the Company divested all prior business efforts.

Note 2. Liquidity

The Company used $
69.1
 million of cash in its operating activities, had a net loss of $
175.9
 million during 2024 and has an accumulated deficit of $
452.3
 million at December 31, 2024 resulting from having incurred losses since its inception. The Company had $
87.9
 million of cash and cash equivalents and $
230.7
 million of marketable securities on December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
50.0
 million outstanding under the loan and security agreement with Oxford Financing LLC and its affiliates (collectively, Oxford) entered into in December 2024. Under the terms of the loan agreement with Oxford, an additional $
100
 million may become available in 
three
 additional tranches, with tranches of $
50
 million and $
25
 million contingent upon FDA approval of DCCR for the treatment of PWS and one tranche of $
25
 million contingent upon certain commercial milestones. A final $
50
 million may be made available upon the Company's mutual consent with Oxford. The loan carries an interest-only period of 
48 
months and a total term of 
60
 months; provided that if specific milestones are achieved prior to September 30, 2026, the interest-only period and maturity date will be extended by 
12
 months. The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to, subject to certain conditions, (a) 1-month term SOFR plus (b) 
5.50
%.

Prior to entering into the Oxford loan and security agreement, the Company had historically financed its operations principally through issuance of equity securities. 
On May 9, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 
3,450,000
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
46.00
 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were $
158.7
 million, before deducting the underwriter discount and other offering expenses, totaling approximately $
9.7
 million. On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Agreement
SM 
(the Sales Agreement) with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent (Jefferies), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $
150
 million.

78

In December 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement providing for the sale of up to $
60.0
 million in warrants (Tranche A and Tranche B) and the common stock issuable upon the exercise thereof. 
Cumulative to date through December 31, 2024, the Company has received $
10.0
 million from the sale of these warrants and $
44.8
 million in proceeds from the exercise of certain of these warrants. Warrants with an aggregate exercise price of $
5.2
 million are still outstanding.

The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. However, the Company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing.

Note 3. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications on the consolidated statements of cash flows have been made to conform to current period presentation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Key estimates included in the financial statements include the valuation of deferred income tax assets, the valuation of financial instruments, stock-based compensation, accrued costs for services rendered in connection with third-party contractor clinical trial activities, and the valuation of contingent liabilities for the purchase price of assets obtained through acquisition.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at U.S. banking institutions. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by three and two separate financial institutions, respectively, and at times these balances may exceed the federally-insured limits. Operating cash in excess of federally-insured limits is custodied at a separate financial institution with an overnight sweep feature into a U.S. government money market fund.

Segments

The Company operates in 
one
 segment. Management uses one measurement of profitability and does not segregate its business for internal reporting, making operating decisions, and assessing financial performance. All long-lived assets are maintained in the U.S.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including its money market funds, purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in institutions in the U.S. and include deposits in a money market funds which were unrestricted as to withdrawal or use.

79

Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale and records such assets at estimated fair value in the balance sheets, with unrealized gains and non-credit related losses that are determined to be temporary, if any, reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company classifies marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than three months but less than one year as marketable securities, and those with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and recorded as interest income and were immaterial for all periods presented. 
To the extent the amortized cost basis of the available-for-sale debt securities exceeds the fair value, management assesses the debt securities for credit loss; however, management considers the risk of credit loss to be minimized by the Company's policy of investing in financial instruments issued by highly-rated financial institutions. When assessing the risk of credit loss, management considers factors such as the severity and the reason of the decline in value (i.e., any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency or other adverse conditions specifically related to the security) and management's intended holding period and time horizon for selling. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did 
no
t recognize any credit losses related to its available-for-sale debt securities. Further, as of December 31, 2024, the Company did 
no
t record an allowance for credit losses related to its available-for-sale debt securities. During 2023 and 2022, the Company did not hold any marketable securities.
Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of payments primarily related to clinical trials, insurance and short-term deposits. Prepaid expenses are initially recorded upon payment and are expensed as goods or services are received.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between 
three
 and 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their useful life or the remaining term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized.

Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Specifically, it considers whether it controls the underlying asset and has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. If the contractual arrangement contains a lease, the Company then determines whether it is an operating or finance lease. Right-of-Use (ROU) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease classification results in a front-loaded expense recognition pattern over the lease term as it recognizes interest expense and amortization expense as separate components of lease expense.

The Company does not separate lease components from non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets, and instead accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single component.  Variable lease payments are recognized as they are incurred and primarily include common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and other operating costs that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the space leased by the Company. The Company does not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases with an original lease term of less than one year.

80

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.

Intangible Assets

In March 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Essentialis in accordance with the merger agreement by and between the Company and Essentialis dated December 22, 2016 (the Merger Agreement). The merger transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the value of $
22.0
 million was assigned to the identifiable intangible asset relating to the patent for DCCR, which patent is currently set to expire in June 2028.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which for the patent is 
11 years
. The useful life of the intangible asset is evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life.
Debt
Debt is recognized at its principal amounts upon issuance, net of any issuance costs. The Company categorizes its debt into current and long-term liabilities based on the maturity date. Interest expense on debt is recorded in the period in which it is incurred. Debt issuance costs are accreted into interest expense using the straight-line method over the contractual term of the debt.  The Company regularly reviews its debt agreements for compliance with covenants and assesses its ability to meet future obligations.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonus, stock-based compensation, consultant fees, certain facility costs and other costs associated with clinical trials and the manufacture of our drug product. Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with CROs and other vendors. Invoicing CROs and CMOs for services performed can often occur several months later. The Company accrues the costs incurred for clinical trial activities as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. For other services the Company accrues the costs in connection with third-party contractor activities based on its estimate of fees and costs associate with the contract that were rendered during the period and they are expensed as incurred.
Costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use are expensed to research and development costs when incurred.

Change in fair value of contingent consideration

The Company recorded the value of contingent future consideration to be paid for the acquisition of Essentialis as a liability in March 2017 at the date of the acquisition. The changes in value of the liability for the contingent consideration since the acquisition date are recorded as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recorded for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided against the Company’s deferred income tax assets when their realization is not reasonably assured.

81

The Company assesses all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and the Company will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.

Common Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company classifies common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivative financial instruments as equity if the contracts (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (iii) contain reset provisions as either an asset or a liability. The Company assesses classification of its freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required.

The Company determined that certain freestanding derivatives, which principally consist of 2018 PIPE Warrants, do not satisfy the criteria for classification as equity instruments due to the existence of certain cash settlement features that are not within the sole control of the Company or variable settlement provision that cause them to not be indexed to the Company’s own stock.

The Company classified the 2018 PIPE Warrants at their fair value and re-measured them at each balance sheet date until they were exercised or expired. Any changes in the fair value were recognized as Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The 2018 PIPE Warrants expired in December 2023.
Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation costs related to stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors and consultants are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award. For restricted stock units this fair value is based on the Company’s common stock price on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period for service-based awards. For performance-based awards the requisite service period is the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. If the Company had made different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share of common stock could have been significantly different. These assumptions include:

•
Expected life:
 The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected life of the Company’s service-based stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified method”, based on the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period. The expected life for the performance-based options was determined based on consideration of the contractual term of the stock options, an estimate of the date the performance criteria would be met and expectations of employee behavior.

82

•
Risk-free interest rate:
 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the stock options. 
•
Volatility:
 The estimated volatility rate is based on the volatilities of the Company’s common stock for a historical period equal to the expected life of the stock options. 
•
Dividend rate:
 The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company used an expected dividend yield of 
zero
. 
The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Recent Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date
.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which provides updates to qualitative and quantitative reportable segment disclosure requirements, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and increased interim disclosure requirements, among others. The ASU requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures to be disclosed in interim periods. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company 
adopted
 ASU 2023-07 on 
October 1, 2024
 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
which amends the guidance in
 ASC 740, Income Taxes
. This amendment is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption is permitted either prospectively or retrospectively, and the Company will adopt the amendment on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expense, 
which requires the disclosure of additional information related to certain costs and expenses, including amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, and depreciation and amortization included in each income statement line item. The guidance also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and the Company’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon adoption.

Note 4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.

83

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

The fair value hierarchy defines a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:

•
Level I — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•
Level II — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and 
•
Level III — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity for the related assets or liabilities. 
The categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The fair value of marketable securities, which are Level 2 financial instruments, is based upon market prices quoted on the last day of the fiscal period or other observable market inputs. The Company obtains pricing information from its investment manager and generally determines the fair value of investment securities using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids and/or offers.

Based on the terms of the completed merger with Essentialis on March 7, 2017, the Company is obligated to make cash earnout payments of up to a maximum of $
21.2
 million to the former Essentialis stockholders. The fair value of the Essentialis purchase price contingent liability is estimated using scenario-based methods based upon the Company’s analysis of the likelihood of obtaining specified approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as achieving two commercial sales milestones of $
100
 million and $
200
 million in cumulative revenue. The Level 3 estimates are based, in part, on subjective assumptions. In determining the likelihood of this occurring, the analysis relied on published research relating to clinical development success rates. Based on management’s assessment, an 
88
%
 probability of achieving all three milestones was determined to be reasonable as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the periods presented, the Company has not changed the manner in which it values its Essentialis purchase price contingent liability.
The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers within the hierarchy during the periods presented.

Note 6. Warrants
The Company has issued multiple warrant series, of which the 2018 PIPE Warrants were determined to be liabilities pursuant to the guidance established by 
ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging.

86

Warrants Issued as Part of the Units in the 2018 PIPE Offering

The 2018 PIPE Warrants were issued on December 19, 2018 in the 2018 PIPE Offering, pursuant to a Warrant Agreement with each of the investors in the 2018 PIPE Offering, and prior to their expiration on December 21, 2023, entitled the holders to purchase 
34,241
 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to $
30.00
 per share, subject to adjustments.

In the event of a change of control of the Company, the holders of unexercised warrants had the option to present their unexercised warrants to the Company, or its successor, to be purchased by the Company, or its successor, in an amount equal to the per share value determined by the Black-Scholes methodology.
Since the Company may have been obligated to settle the 2018 PIPE Warrants in cash, the Company classified the 2018 PIPE Warrants as long-term liabilities at their fair value and re-measured the warrants at each balance sheet date until they were exercised or expire. Any change in the fair value is recognized as Other income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The 2018 PIPE Warrants were either exercised prior to or expired on December 21, 2023.

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies
Facility Leases

On June 13, 2024, the Company entered into a new office lease in Redwood City, California for office space for its headquarters facility. The lease provides office space of approximately 
18,026
 square feet and for base monthly rent payments beginning at $
57,400
 that increase annually by approximately 
3.0
% over the term of 
five years
 from the date of occupancy. In addition to base rent, the Company has agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain operating expenses under the terms of the lease. The lease commencement date was September 1, 2024 when the premises became available for occupancy and the related operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.

The Company's operating lease ROU assets, current operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities each appear as a separate line within the Company's consolidated balance sheets. In September 2024, the Company recorded an increase to its right-of-use assets by $
2.8
 million and an increase to its lease liability of $
2.8
 million as a result of the June 2024 office lease. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's 
sh
ort-term liabilities
 were equal to $
0.5
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively, and the 
long-term operating lease liabilities
 were equal to $
2.5
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively.

The Company's prior operating lease for its predecessor headquarters facility office space in Redwood City, California 
began in 
June 2021
 and expired in 
May 2023
. In April 2023, the Company entered into a 
twenty-four month
 lease extension commencing on June 1, 2023. The term of the lease extension expires in 
May 2025
. As a result of the lease extension, in 2023, the Company recorded an increase to its right-of-use assets by $
0.6
 million and an increase to its lease liability by $
0.6
 million.
The weighted average discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities was

8.5
%
 as of December 31, 2024 over a remaining term of 
4.7
 years, and 
8.25
% as of December 31, 2023 over the remaining term of 
17
 months. The discount rates were determined based on estimates of the Company's incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.

Other Commitments
The Company enters into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies as well as other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's non-cancelable other commitments aggregated $
0.9
 million.

Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company’s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.

Note 8. Long-term Debt
On December 17, 2024, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement for up to $
200
 million with Oxford. The loan is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets, including its intellectual property, subject to certain limitations.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
50.0
 million outstanding under the Oxford loan agreement. An additional $
100
 million may become available in 
three
 tranches, with tranches of $
50
 million and $
25
 million contingent upon FDA approval of DCCR for the treatment of PWS and one tranche of $
25
 million contingent upon certain commercial milestones. A final $
50
 million may be made available upon the mutual consent of the Company and Oxford. 
The loan carries an interest-only period of 
48 months
 and a total term of 
60 months
; provided that if specific milestones are achieved prior to September 30, 2026, the interest-only period and maturity date will be extended by 
12 months
. The term loans accrue interest, payable monthly, at a floating rate equal to, subject to certain conditions, (a) 1-month term SOFR plus (b) 
5.50
%. The principal portion of the loan is due in 
eleven
 equal 
monthly
 installments beginning 
February 1, 2029
, through 
December 1, 2029
.

However, if a specified milestone is achieved on or after December 17, 2025, then the term loan will begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on 
February 1, 2030
, and the maturity date will be extended to 
December 1, 2030
.
 At maturity, the final principal payment will include a fee of 
5
% 
of the total

88

principal 
borrowed. The $
2.5
 million final interest payment related to the $
50
 million borrowed as of December 31, 2024 is accrued over the term of loan as long-term accrued interest payable. However, if a specified milestone is achieved on or after December 17, 2025, then the term loan will begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on 
February 1, 2030
, the maturity date will be extended to 
December 1, 2030
, and the final payment will include a fee of 
6.5
% of the total principal borrowed. As of December 31, 2024, $
21
 thousand was accrued as part of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan issuance costs of $
174
 thousand are recorded as a reduction of the principal loan balance on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
231
 thousand in interest expense and $
209
 thousand of interest was paid.
The loan and security agreement provides for both affirmative and negative covenants. including covenants limiting the ability of the Company and their subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, incur debt, grant liens, pay dividends and distributions on their capital stock, make investments and acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a loan facility of this size and type. In addition, the loan and security agreement contains (1) a minimum cash covenant commencing on June 30, 2025 if the Company has not obtained FDA approval for DCCR for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and at all times thereafter until such approval is received and (2) a minimum revenue covenant commencing on the earlier of the date that the more than $
50
 million principal amount of term loans have been funded under the loan and security agreement and June 30, 2026; provided that such minimum revenue covenant shall not be tested during periods when the Company’s market capitalization or unrestricted cash meet certain minimum thresholds. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Borrowers’ obligations under the loan and security agreement, the termination of the Lenders’ commitments, a 
5.0
% increase in the applicable rate of interest and the exercise by the Lender of other rights and remedies provided for under the loan and security agreement.

. In aggregate, the Company received $
129.0
 million of gross proceeds less offering costs of $

Securities Purchase Agreement
On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement (Private Placement) with certain entities and members of management (collectively, Purchasers). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Purchasers warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of

 million from the exercise of the Tranche A warrants. The Tranche B warrants are also immediately exercisable and expire upon the earlier of 
3.5
 years from the date of issuance or 
30
 days following receipt of FDA approval of DCCR for the treatment of PWS. Through December 31, 2024, certain investors had exercised their Tranche B warrants and the Company has received $

2,666,667
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
3.75

1,333,333
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price $

4.50
 per share. The net proceeds of the offering were $
13.8
 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses.

Equity Incentive Plans

2014 Plan

The Company maintains the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan). Under the 2014 Plan the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units or performance shares to employees, directors, advisors, and consultants. Options granted under the 2014 Plan may be incentive stock options (ISOs) or nonqualified stock options (NSOs). ISOs may be granted only to Company employees, including officers and directors.

The Board has the authority to determine to whom stock options will be granted, the number of options, the term, and the exercise price. Options are to be granted at an exercise price not less than fair value. For individuals holding more than 
10
% of the voting rights of all classes of stock, the exercise price of an option will not be less than 
110
% of fair value. Performance-based grants have vesting contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to the Company’s commercialization of its therapeutics. The contractual term of an option is no longer than 
five years
 for ISOs for which the grantee owns greater than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock and no longer than 
ten years
 for all other options. The terms and conditions governing restricted stock units is at the sole discretion of the Board.

On January 17, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 which registered an additional 
1
 million shares automatically available for issuance under the 2014 Plan as of January 1, 2024. On June 6, 2024, the stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2014 Plan which included an increase of 
2
 million shares, which became immediately available for issuance. 
As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
155,517
 shares were available for future grant under the 2014 Plan.

Inducement Plan

The Company maintains the

2020 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan). The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units, and its terms are substantially similar to the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.

In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) and Rule 5635(c)(3) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals not previously employees or non-employee directors of the Company (or following such individuals’ bona fide period of non-employment with the Company), as an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company, or, to the extent permitted by Rule 5635(c)(3) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, in connection with a merger or acquisition. On January 31, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 
which registered 
500,000
 shares available for issuance under the Inducement Plan, 
which became available for issuance following approval of the Board of Directors on January 24, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, a total of

 million, $
5.9
 million 
and $
2.5

Stock Options

The Company granted options to purchase 
1,819,324
 of the Company's common stock to employees and a consultant during year ended December 31, 2024, and 
1,821,784
 and

 to employees during year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no performance-based options granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The fair value of each award granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include the following estimates:

•
Expected life:
 The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected life of the Company’s service-based stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified method”, based on the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period. The expected life for the performance-based options was determined based on consideration of the contractual term of the stock options, an estimate of the date the performance criteria would be met and expectations of employee behavior.
•
Risk-free interest rate:
 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the stock options. 
•
Volatility:
 The estimated volatility rate is based on the volatilities of the Company’s common stock for a historical period equal to the expected life of the stock options. 
•
Dividend rate:
 The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company used an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.

Net deferred tax assets

The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty as to whether such assets will be realized. The valuation allowance increased by $
17.6
 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 primarily due to the generation of current year net operating losses, research and development and orphan drug tax credits claimed, capitalized research and experimental costs, and stock-based compensation.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
173.5
 million of federal, $
113.5
 million of state and 
no
 foreign net operating losses available to offset future taxable income. The Federal net operating loss carryforwards arising from years prior to 2018 began to expire in 2022, however post 2017 federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
152.6
 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had $
16.3
 million of federal orphan drug and research and development credits and $
5.0
 million of state research and development credit carryforwards. The federal research and development credit carryforward begin to expire in 2024 and the state research and development credit can be carried forward indefinitely. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize such costs over a period of 
five
 or 
fifteen years
. While it is possible that Congress may modify, defer, or repeal such provision, we have no assurance that the provision will be modified, deferred or repealed.
Utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in the event of a change in the Company’s ownership, as defined. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit before utilization. The Company has completed a Section 382 analysis from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2023 and determined that a change in ownership has occurred on March 7, 2017, December 21, 2018, June 30, 2020 and September 26, 2023. As a result, the net operating loss carryforwards generated on or prior to September 26, 2023 are subject to annual limitations before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. 
Of the $
214.7
 million net operating loss carryforwards generated on or before December 31, 2023, approximately $
90
 million are expected to be unavailable for future utilizations. 
For years ended after

96

December 31, 2023, the utilization of such net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards maybe subject to further limitation in the event an additional ownership change were to occur for tax purposes.
U.S. taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, as the earnings, if any, are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

The Company uses the “more likely than not” criterion for recognizing the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions and to establish measurement criteria for income tax benefits. The Company has determined it has $
6.4
 million of unrecognized assets and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Changes in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months are expected to be similar to prior years and should not significantly increase or decrease. In the event the Company should need to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax liabilities, this amount will be recorded as a component of other expense.
There were 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, unrecognized tax benefits of $
6.4
 million would be offset by a change in valuation allowance.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, certain state jurisdictions, United Kingdom and Ireland. The Company paid minimal foreign taxes in 2024 and 
zero
 in each of 2023 and 2022. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. In the U.S federal jurisdiction, tax years 2003 forward remain open to examination, in the state tax jurisdiction, years 2008 forward remain open to examination and in the foreign jurisdiction, years 2015 forward remain open to examination. The Company is currently not under audit by any federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction.

Note 11. Net Loss per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Shares of common stock that are potentially issuable for little or no cash consideration at issuance, such as the Company's pre-funded warrants issued in March 2022 and October 2023 and in connection with the exercise of certain May 2023 Tranche A and Tranche B warrants, are considered outstanding common stock and are included in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share in connection with 
ASC 260 Earnings Per Shares
. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding and dilutive potential common stock that would be issued upon the exercise or vesting of common stock awards and exercise of common stock warrants that are not pre-funded. The Company applies the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share as its warrants issued in March 2022, May 2023 and October 2023 are participating securities.  However, the two-class method does not impact the net loss per share of common stock as the March 2022, May 2023 and October 2023 common warrants issued do not participate in losses
. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the effect of issuing the respective potential common stock is anti-dilutive due to the net losses in those periods and therefore the number of shares used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share are the same in each of those periods.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES

Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024 because of the material weakness in internal controls discussed below. Notwithstanding the material weakness, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on certain criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024, due to the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically:

•
The Company had ineffective design and operation of controls over certain information technology general controls (ITGCs), including segregation of incompatible duties, program change management, and user access controls to ensure: (i) that access to applications and data, and the ability to perform program changes, were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and (ii) that the activities of individuals with access to modify data and make program changes were appropriately monitored and restricted. Automated process-level and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency.

The material weakness described above did not result in a material misstatement to the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements, nor in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

The registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.

Remediation Plans

100

Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management intends to take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, which include the following:

•
Hire additional personnel in the accounting and financial reporting function that would allow for appropriate segregation of duties, both systematically and operationally. We will continue to reassess staffing and add additional resources, as required, with the requisite experience and training, to support our system of internal control;

•
Implement a training program for all personnel responsible for internal controls over financial reporting, including educating control owners regarding the requirements of each control. For control owners with IT responsibilities, develop and implement additional training and awareness programs addressing ITGC policy and requirements, with a specific focus on user access and change management processes and controls;

•
Continue to enhance, standardize and monitor the ongoing improvements in design and operating effectiveness of our controls and the adherence of our personnel to any enhancements in controls, policies, and procedures. Moreover, within our IT environment, increase the extent of oversight and verification checks included in the operation of user access and program change management controls and processes;

•
We will continue to report regularly to the audit committee on the progress and results of the remediation plan, including the identification, status and resolution of internal control deficiencies.

We believe the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the identified material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to management concluding that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are effective. We may also conclude that the additional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness which may necessitate additional implementation and evaluation time. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to remediate the material weakness expeditiously.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

101

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of

Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.

Adverse Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Soleno Therapeutics Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness have been identified and included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

•
The Company did not design and maintain formal and effective controls over certain information technology general controls (ITGCs) for IT systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, (a) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequate restriction of user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data (b) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financially significant IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. Automated process-level and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency.

This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal December 31, 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 28, 2025 on those financial statements.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

102

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
