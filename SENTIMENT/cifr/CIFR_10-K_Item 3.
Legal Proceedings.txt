CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10‑K (the “Annual Report”) contains forward‑looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements contained in this Annual Report, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements about our beliefs and expectations regarding our future results of operations and financial position, planned business model and strategy, our bitcoin mining and HPC data center development, timing and likelihood of success, capacity, functionality and timing of operations of data centers, expectations regarding the operations of data centers, potential strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures and partnerships, and management plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “seeks,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. The forward‑looking statements in this Annual Report are only predictions and are largely based on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward‑looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward‑looking statements, including, but not limited to, the important factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report, and in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The forward‑looking statements in this Annual Report are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.
You should read this Annual Report and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report and have filed as exhibits to this Annual Report with the understanding that our actual future results, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward‑looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward‑looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward‑looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock (“Common Stock”). The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
•
We operate in a rapidly evolving industry and have an evolving business model and strategy, which includes our increasing focus on diversification into constructing and operating data centers for HPC companies, as well as bitcoin mining.
•
If we fail to grow our hashrate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.
•
The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an investment in us. 
•
We may face several risks due to disruptions in the digital asset markets, including but not limited to,  financing risk, risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments or other assets, risks of legal proceedings and government investigations, and risks from price declines or price volatility of digital assets.
•
Any unfavorable global economic, business or political conditions, such as geopolitical tensions, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, trade restrictions, tariffs, or similar events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Bitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours, increase taxes on the purchase of electricity used to mine bitcoin, or even fully or partially ban mining operations.
•
We have concentrated our operations and, thus, are particularly exposed to the performance of the Odessa Facility and changes in the regulatory environment, market conditions and natural disasters in Texas. 
•
We depend on third parties, including electric grid operators, electric utility providers and manufacturers of certain critical and specialized equipment, and rely on components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips that have been subject to periods of significant shortage and high innovation pace.
•
We may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.
•
We are vulnerable to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including severe heat, winter weather events, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, as well as power outages and other industrial incidents or mechanical failures, which could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our results of operations.
•
Bitcoin miners and other necessary hardware are subject to malfunction, technological obsolescence and physical degradation
•
If we or our third-party providers fail to protect confidential information and/or experience cybersecurity incidents, such as cyber-attacks, data breaches, hacking attacks or malware, there may be disruptions to our operations, triggering significant liability for us, which could harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
•
The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings, and our operating results may be adversely affected by our hedging activity.
•
There is a potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be considered a general unsecured creditor thereof.
4
•
Regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of bitcoin in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.
•
Our sources of revenue are dependent on bitcoin and the Bitcoin ecosystem, which can be highly volatile. 
•
Any potential use of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and generative artificial intelligence could lead to unintended consequences and result in reputational harm and litigation. 
•
We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our future financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as may lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.
