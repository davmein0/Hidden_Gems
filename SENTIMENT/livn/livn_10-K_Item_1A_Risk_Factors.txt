Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $108.1 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to (i) an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $72.2 million, (ii) an increase in customer collections, (iii) reduced cash outflows for inventories, and (iv) a decrease in 3T Heater-Cooler litigation settlement payments of $36.2 million.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $7.8 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $12.1 million primarily related to purchases and development of internal-use software, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of equity investments of $5.4 million.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $2.9 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to payment of the ALung contingent consideration arrangement of $13.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from net debt borrowings and repayments of $5.7 million.
Market Risk
LivaNova is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations, including risks from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate risks, and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect LivaNova’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company manages these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, at certain times, derivative financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Due to the global nature of LivaNova’s operations, the Company is exposed to FX fluctuations. Historically, LivaNova has maintained a foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy that utilizes cash flow hedges and freestanding foreign currency derivatives to reduce the Company’s exposure to unanticipated fluctuations in forecasted revenue and costs, inter-company debt, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and accounts payable caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Upon the settlement of LivaNova’s foreign currency cash flow hedges in the fourth quarter of 2022 and following an in-depth analysis of the utility of the Company’s cash flow hedging program, LivaNova discontinued its foreign currency cash flow hedging program. LivaNova continues to use freestanding derivative forward contracts to offset exposure to the variability of the value associated with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
LivaNova mitigates its credit risk relating to counterparties of its derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting the Company’s exposure to individual counterparties and by entering into ISDA Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with almost all of LivaNova’s derivative counterparties. The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross-default provisions, termination events, and set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.
Interest Rate Risk
LivaNova is subject to interest rate risk on its investments and debt. Historically, LivaNova has entered into interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce the risk of increased borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. Under these agreements, LivaNova agrees to 
46
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. These interest rate swaps are structured to mirror the payment terms of the underlying loan. The Company’s outstanding interest rate swaps expired on April 6, 2023. LivaNova elected not to renew the interest rate swaps. Interest expense associated with the Initial Term Facility is principally offset by holding proceeds from the Term Facilities in a depository account, which earns a floating rate of interest.
If interest rates associated with LivaNova’s variable-rate financing arrangements as of December 31, 2024 were to increase/(decrease) by 100 basis points, the effect on interest expense within LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss) would be an increase/(decrease) of $3.2 million, respectively, offset by an increase/(decrease) in interest income from amounts held in variable-rate depository accounts.
Concentration of Credit Risk
LivaNova’s trade accounts receivable represents potential concentrations of credit risk. This risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas, as well as LivaNova’s efforts to control its exposure to credit risk by monitoring its receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits. In addition, LivaNova has historically had strong collections and minimal write-offs. While LivaNova believes that its reserves for credit losses are adequate, essentially all of the Company’s trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors worldwide, and accordingly, LivaNova is exposed to their respective business, economic, and country-specific variables. Although LivaNova does not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economies and healthcare systems.
