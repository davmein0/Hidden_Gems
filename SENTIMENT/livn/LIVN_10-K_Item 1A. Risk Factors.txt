ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
LivaNova maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including LivaNova’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Applicable SEC rules require an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. LivaNova’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, LivaNova’s CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
LivaNova’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of LivaNova’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 using the criteria set forth in the 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, LivaNova concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
LivaNova’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in LivaNova’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, LivaNova’s internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LivaNova PLC
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LivaNova PLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Cardiopulmonary (CP) Reporting Unit
As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $750.0 million as of December 31, 2024, and the amount of goodwill associated with the CP reporting unit was $351.3 million. Management conducts impairment testing of goodwill on October 1st each year. If management determines that goodwill is more-likely-than-not impaired, management compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value refers to the price that would be received if management were to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model and requires various assumptions, including revenue growth rates and discount rates. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the CP reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the CP reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions relating to revenue growth rates and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the CP reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and the discount rate. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.

LIVANOVA PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES’
NOTES

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Note 1. Nature of Operations
Description of the Business
LivaNova PLC is a market-leading global medical technology company. The Company designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells products and therapies that are consistent with LivaNova’s mission to provide hope for patients and their families through medical technologies, delivering life-changing solutions in select neurological and cardiac conditions. LivaNova is a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and is headquartered in London, England. LivaNova’s ordinary shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “LIVN.”
Business Segments
For the periods presented herein, LivaNova was comprised of 
two
 reportable segments: Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation.
Cybersecurity Incident
As previously disclosed, in November 2023, LivaNova detected a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a disruption of portions of the Company’s information technology systems. Promptly after detecting the issue, LivaNova began an investigation with assistance from external cybersecurity experts and coordinated with law enforcement. The Company implemented remediation measures to mitigate the impact of the incident. The Company also assessed the nature and scope of the affected data, analyzed its statutory notification obligations, and notified affected individuals and regulators as required by applicable law. For further discussion on legal and regulatory developments, refer to “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.” The incident has been contained, and the Company’s mitigation efforts are considered complete.
Through December 31, 2024, LivaNova incurred direct costs totaling $
11.6
 million in connection with this cybersecurity incident, including $
9.0
 million and $
2.6
 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total incurred direct costs primarily included external cybersecurity expert and legal fees, system restoration costs, and a $
1.2
 million provision related to the class action settlement, and do not include business interruption losses. The Company expects to incur additional costs related to this incident in the future. For further discussion on legal and regulatory developments, refer to “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.” LivaNova maintains insurance, including cyber insurance, which is subject to certain retentions and policy limitations that will likely limit the amount that the insurers may reimburse the Company. LivaNova has filed claims for insurance reimbursement of covered costs and business interruption losses related to this incident and has submitted additional claims and supplemental requests for reimbursement as new costs have been incurred. During 2024, LivaNova received $
8.4
 million, including $
5.1
 million in reimbursement of covered costs and $
3.3
 million in reimbursement of 
business interruption losses under the Company’s cyber insurance policy
. The Company’s insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all costs and expenses related to this cybersecurity incident or may be unavailable to cover all costs and expenses related to this cybersecurity incident.
Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates, and Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of LivaNova have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for LivaNova include LivaNova’s wholly-owned subsidiaries and the Trust. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of LivaNova’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in such financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that LivaNova may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, valuation and amortization of intangible assets; goodwill, other long-lived assets (asset group); measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities; uncertain income tax positions; contingent consideration arrangements; derivative assets and liabilities; legal and other contingencies; stock-based compensation; obsolete 
F-7
and slow-moving inventories; models, such as an impairment analysis; and, in general, allocations to provisions and the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded in a business combination. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Reclassifications
The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts on the consolidated statements of cash flows for comparative purposes.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
LivaNova considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, consisting of demand deposit accounts and money market mutual funds, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates their fair value.
Restricted Cash
The Company classifies cash that is not available for use in its operations as restricted cash within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, LivaNova’s restricted cash balance was $
294.7
 million and was comprised of cash deposits with Barclays held as collateral for the SNIA Litigation Guarantee. As security for the SNIA Litigation Guarantee, LivaNova is required to grant cash collateral to Barclays in USD in an amount equal to the USD equivalent of 
105
% of the amount of the SNIA Litigation Guarantee calibrated on a biweekly basis. For additional information regarding the SNIA litigation, please refer to “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.”
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists of trade receivables from direct customers and distributors. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses based on its estimates of the ability of customers to make required payments, historical credit experience, existing economic conditions, and expected future trends. LivaNova writes off uncollectible accounts against the allowance when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.
Inventories
LivaNova states its inventories at the lower of cost, using the FIFO method, or net realizable value. The Company’s calculation of cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components, direct labor, and overhead, including depreciation of manufacturing related assets. LivaNova reduces the carrying value of inventories for those items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.
PP&E
PP&E is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred, while significant renewals and improvements are capitalized. LivaNova computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the following terms: the useful life of the asset or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured on the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Capital improvements to buildings are added as building components and are depreciated over the useful life of the improvement or the building, whichever is less.
Goodwill
LivaNova allocates the amounts the Company pays for an acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the date of acquisition, including property, plant, and equipment; inventories; accounts receivable; long-term debt; and identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. LivaNova allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred and are reported in SG&A on the consolidated statements of income (loss). LivaNova recognizes adjustments to the provisional amounts identified during the measurement period with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts is recorded in the same period’s consolidated financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Intangible Assets, Other Than Goodwill
Intangible assets shown on the consolidated balance sheets consist of finite-lived and indefinite-lived assets expected to generate future economic benefits and are recorded at their respective fair values as of their acquisition date. Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology and technical capabilities, including patents, related know-how, and licensed patent rights, as well as trade names and customer relationships. Customer relationships consist of relationships with hospitals and surgeons in the countries where LivaNova operates. Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill are composed of IPR&D assets acquired in acquisitions. LivaNova amortizes its finite-lived intangible assets over the assets’ useful lives using the straight-line method. Estimating the useful lives of intangible assets requires LivaNova to apply significant judgment.
Amortization expense is included on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss) within cost of sales or SG&A based on the nature of the underlying intangible asset. LivaNova evaluates its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different useful life or impairment. If LivaNova changes its estimate of the useful life of an asset, the Company amortizes the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life.
Impairments of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived Assets Impairment
Assets Held and Used
LivaNova evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets and investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale, discontinuation, or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group; (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions; (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which LivaNova operates; and (iv) operating or cash flow losses.
For PP&E and intangible assets used in LivaNova’s operations, recoverability generally is determined by comparing the carrying value of an asset or group of assets to the expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of an asset, or group of assets is not recoverable, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the asset or group of assets and its estimated fair value. The asset grouping as well as the determination of expected undiscounted cash flow amounts requires significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, including with regard to cash flows generated upon disposition. LivaNova measures fair value as the price that would be received if the Company were to sell the assets in an orderly transaction. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
LivaNova conducts impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on October 1st each year. LivaNova tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill Impairment
LivaNova conducts impairment testing of its goodwill on October 1st each year. Testing is performed at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly viewed by management. LivaNova’s operating segments are deemed to be its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. LivaNova tests goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
If LivaNova determines that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value refers to the price that would be received if LivaNova were to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model and requires various assumptions, including revenue growth rates and discount rates. If the carrying amount of the Company’s reporting unit is greater than zero and its fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, up to and including the carrying amount of the goodwill.
If the aggregate fair value of LivaNova’s reporting units exceeds its market capitalization, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which includes a comparison to implied control premiums from recent market transactions within its industry or other relevant benchmark data.
F-9
Goodwill impairment evaluations are highly subjective. In most instances, such evaluations involve expectations of future cash flows that reflect LivaNova’s judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations. The estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in the application of LivaNova’s goodwill impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational, industry, market, economic, and political environments. The use of different estimates, judgments, assumptions, and expectations regarding future industry and market conditions and operations could result in materially different asset carrying values and operating results.
Quantitative factors used to determine the fair value of the reporting units reflect LivaNova’s best estimates, which the Company believes are reasonable. Future declines in the reporting units’ operating performance or LivaNova’s anticipated business outlook may reduce the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units and result in an impairment in the future. Factors that could have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to:
•
Decreases in revenue as a result of the inability of LivaNova’s sales force to effectively market and promote the Company’s products;
•
Increased competition, patent expirations, or new technologies or treatments commercialized by competitors;
•
Higher operating costs required to sustain the business;
•
The outcome of litigation, legal proceedings, investigations, or other claims resulting in significant cash outflows; and
•
Increases in the market-participant risk-adjusted WACC.
Derivatives and Risk Management
U.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize all derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure the instruments at fair value through earnings unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge and hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be recognized immediately in earnings or recorded in OCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The changes in the fair value of the derivative are intended to offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or probable commitment. LivaNova evaluates hedge effectiveness at inception. Cash flows from hedging and economic hedges are reported as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
LivaNova uses currency exchange rate derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange on earnings and cash flows. Forward currency exchange rate contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. LivaNova does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and contract maturity date.
Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings to offset exchange differences originated by the hedged item or the current earnings effect of the hedged item.
Upon the settlement of LivaNova’s foreign currency cash flow hedges in the fourth quarter of 2022 and following an in-depth analysis of the utility of the Company’s cash flow hedging program, LivaNova discontinued its foreign currency cash flow hedging program. LivaNova continues to use freestanding derivative forward contracts to offset exposure to the variability of the value associated with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Historically, LivaNova has entered into interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce the risk of increased borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. Under these agreements, LivaNova agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. These interest rate swaps are structured to mirror the payment terms of the underlying loan. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and the maturity of the future cash flows of each contract. The gain or loss on these derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified to interest expense during the period of the respective interest payment. The Company’s interest rate swaps expired on April 6, 2023. LivaNova elected not to renew the interest rate swaps as interest expense 
F-10
associated with the Initial Term Facility is principally offset by holding proceeds from the Initial Term Facility in a depository account, which earns a floating rate of interest.
Fair Value Measurements
LivaNova follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Under this guidance, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of LivaNova. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect LivaNova’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
•
Level 1    -    Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2    -    Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•
Level 3    -    Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.
LivaNova’s financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 include derivative instruments, primarily forward and option currency contracts and interest rate swap contracts, which are valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.
LivaNova’s financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 include contingent consideration liability arrangements and embedded and capped call derivative instruments.
Contingent consideration liabilities result from acquisition agreements that include potential future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones and/or sales-based earnouts. Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred and estimated as the probability of future cash flows, discounted to present value in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of contingent consideration based on the achievement of regulatory milestones is recorded as research and development expense while the change in fair value of sales-based earnout contingent consideration is recorded as cost of sales. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as an investing activity. Contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after the acquisition date are classified as a financing activity up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date, with any excess classified as an operating activity. For further information on LivaNova’s Level 3 contingent consideration liability arrangements, please refer to “Note 8. Fair Value Measurements.” For further information on LivaNova’s Level 3 derivative and embedded derivative instruments, please refer to “Note 9. Financing Arrangements” and “Note 8. Fair Value Measurements.” For further information on LivaNova’s Level 3 convertible notes receivable, please refer to “Note 6. Investments.”
Investments
LivaNova’s investments are comprised of equity securities that may be publicly traded, are in various stages of development, and are reported as investments on the consolidated balance sheets.
Investments in affiliates in which the Company has significant influence, but does not control, and that do not have a readily determinable fair value, are accounted for using the equity method. LivaNova’s share of net income or loss is reflected as one line item on the Company’s consolidated statements of income (loss) under loss from equity method investments and will increase or decrease, as applicable, the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment reported under investments on the consolidated balance sheets.
Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
F-11
Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
LivaNova regularly reviews its investments for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest its investments may not be recoverable, and if an impairment is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized on the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the period the determination is made.
Warranty Obligation
LivaNova offers a warranty on various products. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is sold. The amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the estimated net costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim. LivaNova includes the warranty obligation in accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded to cost of goods sold on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss).
Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions
LivaNova sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans (pension benefits), defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and employees outside the U.S. Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, compensation rate increases, and the expected return on plan assets.
Product Liability Accruals
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. Accruals for product liability claims are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available.
Revenue Recognition
Refer to “Note 3. Revenue Recognition.”
Research and Development
All R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D includes costs of basic research activities as well as engineering and technical effort required to develop a new product or make significant improvements to an existing product or manufacturing process. R&D costs also include regulatory and clinical study expenses, including post-market clinical studies.
Leases
LivaNova determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at its inception. For operating leases with a term greater than 12 months, LivaNova recognizes operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the latter of the Company’s lease standard adoption date of January 1, 2019, or the lease commencement date. LivaNova does not record an operating lease asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes the lease payments for such short-term leases within profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments, such as common area rent, maintenance charges, and rent escalations not known upon lease commencement, are not included in the determination of the minimum lease payments and are expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Operating lease assets also includes any lease payments made in advance and excludes lease incentives. LivaNova’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As most of LivaNova’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, LivaNova uses its IBR based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. LivaNova’s IBR represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the lease term within a particular currency environment. LivaNova used the IBR available nearest to the Company’s adoption date for leases that commenced prior to that date.
Additionally, LivaNova monitors for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of the Company’s leases to determine whether a remeasurement is required. For additional information, refer to “Note 10. Leases.”
F-12
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-Based Awards
LivaNova may grant stock-based awards to directors, officers, and key employees. The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair market value of the award. LivaNova recognizes equity-based compensation expense ratably over the period that services are provided in exchange for the entire award (all vesting periods). LivaNova issues treasury shares for vesting of RSUs and the exercise of SARs and new shares upon stock option exercises. The Company has the right to elect to pay the cash value of vested restricted stock units in lieu of the issuance of new shares.
SARs
LivaNova may grant SARs that confer upon the grantee the contractual right to receive an amount of cash, stock, or a combination of both, that equals the appreciation in the Company’s stock from the award’s grant date to the exercise date. SARs may be exercised at the grantee’s discretion during the exercise period and do not give the grantee an ownership right in the underlying stock. SARs do not involve payment of an exercise price. LivaNova uses the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology to calculate the grant date fair market value of SARs and compensation is expensed ratably over the service period. The Company determines the expected volatility of the awards based on historical volatility. Calculation of compensation for SAR stock awards requires the Company to estimate historical volatility and forfeiture rates.
Service-Based RSUs
LivaNova may grant service-based RSUs at no purchase cost to the grantee. The grantees of unvested units have no voting rights or rights to dividends, and sale or transfer of the units is restricted until they are vested. The fair market value of service-based RSUs is determined using the market closing price on the grant date, and compensation is expensed ratably over the service period. Calculation of compensation for RSU stock awards requires the Company to estimate forfeiture rates. 
Market Performance-Based RSUs
LivaNova may grant market performance-based RSUs at no purchase cost to the grantee. The grantees of unvested units have no voting rights or rights to dividends and sale or transfer of the units is restricted until they are vested. The number of shares that are ultimately transferred to the grantee is dependent upon the Company’s percentile rank of total shareholder return relative to a peer group. The fair market value of market performance-based RSUs is determined utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation on the grant date and compensation is then expensed ratably over the service period. Calculation of compensation for market performance-based stock awards requires the Company to estimate historical volatility and forfeiture rates.
Operating Performance-Based Awards RSUs
LivaNova may grant operating performance-based RSUs at no purchase cost to the grantee. The grantees of unvested units have no voting rights or rights to dividends and sale or transfer of the units is restricted until they are vested. The number of shares that are ultimately transferred to the grantee is dependent upon the Company’s percent achievement of certain targets for cumulative adjusted free cash flow and adjusted return on invested capital. The fair market value of operating performance-based RSUs is determined using the market closing price on the grant date. Compensation is expensed ratably over the service period and is adjusted based upon the estimated and actual percentage achievement of cumulative adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital as compared to target.
Income Taxes
LivaNova is a UK corporation and operates through the Company’s various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. LivaNova’s provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and earns income. LivaNova uses significant judgment and estimates in accounting for its income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of LivaNova’s assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
LivaNova periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized. To the extent that realization does not meet the “more-likely-than-not” criterion, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. LivaNova periodically reviews the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to its ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released. This evidence includes: profitability in the most recent quarters; internal profitability forecasts for the current and next two future years; the amount of 
F-13
deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability; the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition, healthcare reforms, and overall economic conditions; limitations and potential limitations on the use of LivaNova’s net operating losses due to ownership changes, pursuant to IRC Section 382; and the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, if any.
LivaNova files federal and local tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world and is subject to income tax examinations for its fiscal year 2019 and subsequent years, with certain exceptions. While LivaNova believes that its tax return positions are fully supported, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions the Company has taken and assess additional taxes, and as a result, LivaNova may establish reserves for uncertain tax positions, which require a significant degree of management judgment. LivaNova regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company’s reserves; however, the actual outcome of an audit can be significantly different from LivaNova’s expectations, which could have a material impact on the Company’s tax provision. LivaNova’s tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more-likely-than-not threshold. Uncertain tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Some of the reasons a reserve for an uncertain tax benefit may be reversed are: completion of a tax audit; a change in applicable tax law, including a tax case or legislative guidance; or an expiration of the statute of limitations. LivaNova recognizes interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits and records interest in interest expense, and penalties in SG&A, on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss).
Foreign Currency
LivaNova’s reporting currency is the USD; however, a portion of the revenues earned and expenses incurred by certain of LivaNova’s subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the USD. LivaNova determines the functional currency of its subsidiaries that exist and operate in different economic and currency environments based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. LivaNova’s foreign subsidiaries are located in Europe and the United States. The functional currency of LivaNova’s significant European subsidiaries is the Euro, and the functional currency of LivaNova’s significant U.S. subsidiaries is the USD.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the USD are translated into USD based on a combination of both current and historical exchange rates, while their revenues earned, and expenses incurred are translated into USD at average period exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included in AOCI on LivaNova’s consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency different from an entity’s functional currency are included in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss). Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments as substantially all translation adjustments are related to earnings which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the countries where earned.
Contingencies
LivaNova is subject to product liability claims, environmental obligations, government investigations, and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Legal fees and other expenses related to litigation are expensed as incurred and included in SG&A on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss). Contingent liabilities are recorded when LivaNova determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the fact that legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, LivaNova’s assessments involve significant judgment regarding future events.
Note 3. Revenue Recognition
LivaNova generates revenue through contracts with customers consisting primarily of hospitals, healthcare institutions, and distributors. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in customer contracts and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company measures the consideration based upon the estimated amount to be received. The amount of consideration LivaNova ultimately receives varies depending upon the return terms, sales rebates, discounts, and other incentives the Company may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. 
LivaNova has historically experienced a low rate of product returns, and the total value of product returns has not been significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
LivaNova recognizes revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a product or providing service to a customer. Some of LivaNova’s contracts include the purchase of multiple products and/or services. In such cases, LivaNova allocates the transaction price based upon the relative estimated standalone selling price of each product and/or 
F-14
service sold. LivaNova records state and local sales taxes net; that is, the Company excludes sales tax from revenue. Typically, LivaNova’s contracts do not have a significant financing component.
LivaNova incurs incremental commission fees paid to the sales force associated with the sale of products. LivaNova applies the practical expedient within ASC 606-10-50-22 and has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the entity would otherwise recognize is one year or less. As a result, no commissions have been capitalized as contract costs since adoption of ASC 606. The following is a description of the principal activities (separated by reportable segments) from which LivaNova generates its revenue. For more detailed information about LivaNova’s reportable segments, including disaggregated revenue results by major product line and primary geographic markets, see “Note 17. Geographic and Segment Information.”
Cardiopulmonary Products and Services
Cardiopulmonary products include HLMs, oxygenators, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae, and other related accessories.
Cardiopulmonary products may include performance obligations associated with assembly and installation of equipment. Accordingly, LivaNova allocates a portion of the sales prices to installation obligations and recognizes that revenue when the service is provided. LivaNova recognizes revenue for equipment and accessory product sales when control of the equipment or product passes to the customer.
Technical services include installation, repair, and maintenance of cardiopulmonary equipment under service contracts or upon customer request. Technical service agreements generally provide for upfront payments in advance of rendering services or periodic billing over the contract term. Amounts billed in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Technical services are not a significant component of Cardiopulmonary revenue and are presented with the related equipment and accessories revenue.
Neuromodulation Products
Neuromodulation products are comprised of neuromodulation therapy systems for the treatment of DRE and DTD. LivaNova’s Neuromodulation product line includes the VNS Therapy System, which consists of an implantable pulse generator, a lead that connects the generator to the vagus nerve, and other accessories. LivaNova recognizes revenue for Neuromodulation product sales when control passes to the customer.
Contract Balances
Due to the nature of LivaNova’s products and services, revenue producing activities may result in contract assets and contract liabilities. These activities relate primarily to Cardiopulmonary technical services contracts for short-term and multi-year service agreements. Contract assets are primarily comprised of unbilled revenues, which occur when a performance obligation has been completed, but not billed to the customer. Contract liabilities are made up of deferred revenue, which occurs when a customer pays for a service before a performance obligation has been completed. Contract assets are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and were insignificant as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, contract liabilities of $
14.7
 million and $
15.3
 million, respectively, were included within accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities on LivaNova’s consolidated balance sheets.
Note 4. Restructuring
From time to time, 
LivaNova initiates restructuring plans to leverage economies of scale, streamline distribution and logistics, and strengthen operational and administrative effectiveness to reduce overall costs.
During the second quarter of 2022, management committed to implement a cost-optimization and cost reduction program to adapt to current economic conditions, which included a workforce reduction to be completed by mid-2023. LivaNova recognized 
restructuring expense
 under the 2022 Restructuring Plan of $
0.9
 million and $
6.6
 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the plan were approximately $
10
 million, including employee termination benefits, consulting fees, and contract termination costs.
On January 5, 2024, the Board of Directors of LivaNova PLC approved the 2024 Restructuring Plan to enhance the Company’s focus on its core Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation segments. The main component of the 2024 Restructuring Plan was to wind down the ACS segment, which was substantially completed in 2024. LivaNova recognized restructuring expense under the 2024 Restructuring Plan of $
0.1
 million in other operating expenses, and $
12.6
 million for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales on its consolidated statements of income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying amounts associated with the ACS segment, including the long-lived assets (asset group), may not be recoverable. This was determined to be a triggering event occurring in the fourth quarter 
F-15
of 2023 requiring an impairment assessment, based on certain factors, including the results of an updated long-term financial outlook for the ACS segment. 
As such, LivaNova recorded impairments of the following long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2023, included within impairment of long-lived assets on its consolidated statements of income (loss) (in thousands):

“Other” represents LivaNova’s former ACS reportable segment.
As part of LivaNova’s third-quarter 2022 goodwill impairment assessment, the Company considered that revenue for its ACS reporting unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 had declined by 
29
% compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of a reduction in severe COVID-19 cases, hospital-related challenges, and product mix. As a result, the Company lowered its future revenue projections for the ACS reporting unit. Based on these circumstances, LivaNova concluded it was more likely than not that the goodwill of LivaNova’s ACS reporting unit was impaired and performed a quantitative assessment of the goodwill as of September 30, 2022, using management’s then-current estimate of future cash flows. Based on the valuation performed, LivaNova determined that the fair value of the ACS reporting unit was less than the carrying value and recognized a goodwill impairment of $
129.4
 million in LivaNova’s consolidated statement of loss during the year ended December 31, 2022.
LivaNova performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for its Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation reporting units as of October 1, 2024. The assessment was performed using management’s current estimate of future cash flows. LivaNova concluded that the fair value of its Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the respective reporting units and were, therefore, not impaired on the October 1, 2024 test date.

On October 10, 2024, Ceribell, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLL) announced its initial public offering and began trading on October 11, 2024. Per the amended Articles of Incorporation, LivaNova’s Series B Preferred shares converted to common stock upon the offering. As a result, LivaNova’s investment in Ceribell, Inc. is now classified as an investment with a readily determinable fair value and 
F-18
measured on a recurring basis (Level 1) (previously Level 3 with fair value measured on a nonrecurring basis). As of December 31, 2024, LivaNova held 
391,952
 common shares and recognized a $
7.1
 million unrealized gain on investment during the fourth quarter of 2024, which is included in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss). 
(2)
During the second quarter of 2024, LivaNova recognized an impairment of its investment in ShiraTronics, Inc. upon the conversion of LivaNova’s investment from preferred shares to common stock, which is included in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss).

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, LivaNova had commitments to fund follow-on investments up to €
1.0
 million and €
1.9
 million ($
1.0
 million and $
2.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) based on cash calls.
Note 7. Derivatives and Risk Management
Due to the global nature of LivaNova’s operations, the Company is exposed to FX fluctuations. LivaNova enters into FX derivative contracts to reduce the impact of FX fluctuations on earnings and cash flow.
LivaNova is also exposed to equity price risk in connection with its 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, including exchange/conversion and settlement provisions based on the price of its ordinary shares at exchange/conversion or maturity of the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes. The Capped Call Transactions associated with the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares, subject to a capped price per share. LivaNova does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
LivaNova measures all outstanding derivatives each period-end at fair value and reports the fair value as either financial assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a hedge. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are referred to as freestanding derivatives with changes in fair value included in earnings. These derivatives are intended to serve as economic hedges and follow the cash flows of the economic hedged item. The cash flows from these derivative contracts are reported as operating activities on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of cash flows.
If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings upon settlement/termination. Interest rate swap gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to interest expense on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss). LivaNova evaluates hedge effectiveness at inception. LivaNova had no designated hedging instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Freestanding FX Derivatives
The gross notional amount of freestanding FX derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
442.3
 million and $
223.4
 million, respectively. These derivative contracts are designed to offset the FX effects in earnings of various intercompany loans and trade receivables. LivaNova recorded a net gain for freestanding derivatives of $
5.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a net loss of $
1.3
 million, and a net gain of $
4.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These gains and losses are included in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss).
Capped Call Derivatives
The Capped Call Transactions are carried on the consolidated balance sheets as a derivative asset at their estimated fair value and are adjusted at the end of each reporting period, with unrealized gain or loss reflected in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The Capped Call Transactions are measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes model utilizing observable and unobservable market data, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. For additional information, refer to “Note 9. Financing Arrangements.”
2025 Capped Calls
In June 2020, LivaNova issued the 2025 Notes. In connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into related privately-negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. Under the 2025 Capped Calls, the Company purchased a capped call option with an initial strike price of $
60.98
 and an initial cap price of $
100.00
 per share. The strike price, which is subject to certain adjustments, corresponds to the initial exchange price of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Capped Calls are intended to offset any cash payments upon exchange of the 2025 Notes in excess of the principal amount; however, the proceeds are limited to the initial cap price in the event the Company’s share price exceeds the cap price at the time of an exchange. The 2025 Capped Calls expire on December 15, 2025, and must be settled in cash. The 2025 Capped Calls are subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2025 Notes and cover the number of LivaNova’s ordinary shares underlying the 2025 Notes. If the 2025 Capped Calls are terminated early, settlement occurs at their termination value, which is equal to their fair value at the time of the early termination. In connection with the issuance of the 
F-19
2029 Notes, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $
230.0
 million of the 2025 Notes and unwound a corresponding portion of the 2025 Capped Calls at the fair value of such portion of the 2025 Capped Calls. The Company received $
22.5
 million in cash consideration, the fair value of the terminated portion, upon settlement. The terms of the remaining 2025 Capped Calls remain unchanged and continue to be classified as long-term derivative assets.
2029 Capped Calls
In March 2024, LivaNova issued the 2029 Notes. In connection with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, the Company entered into related privately-negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. Under the 2029 Capped Calls, the Company purchased a capped call option with an initial strike price of $
69.40
 and an initial cap price of $
94.28
 per share. The strike price, which is subject to certain adjustments, corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Capped Calls are intended to offset any cash payments and/or cash equivalent value of ordinary shares upon conversion of the 2029 Notes if the market value per ordinary share is greater than the strike price, with such offsets being subject to the initial cap price of $
94.28
 per share. However, the proceeds under the 2029 Capped Calls are limited to the initial cap price in the event the Company’s share price exceeds the cap price at the time of conversion. The 2029 Capped Calls expire on March 15, 2029, and must be settled in cash. The 2029 Capped Calls are subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes and cover the number of LivaNova’s ordinary shares underlying the 2029 Notes. If the 2029 Capped Calls are terminated early, settlement occurs at their termination value, which is equal to their fair value at the time of the early termination. For transaction costs associated with entering into the 2029 Capped Calls, refer to “Additions” in the “Reconciliation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities” table within “Note 8. Fair Value Measurements.”
Embedded Derivatives
The 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes each include terms resulting in a bifurcated embedded derivative. The Embedded Derivatives are measured at fair value using a binomial lattice model and estimated discounted cash flows that utilize observable and unobservable market data and are adjusted at the end of each reporting period, with the unrealized gain or loss reflected in foreign exchange and other income/(expense) in the consolidated statements of income (loss). For additional information, refer to “Note 9. Financing Arrangements.”
Counterparty Credit Risk
LivaNova is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the Company’s derivatives.
The Option Counterparties are financial institutions. To limit LivaNova’s credit risk, the Company selected financial institutions with a minimum long-term investment grade credit rating. LivaNova’s exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of the Option Counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, LivaNova will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to the Company’s exposure at that time under the 2025 Capped Calls and/or 2029 Capped Calls, as applicable, with that Option Counterparty.
To manage credit risk with respect to LivaNova’s other derivatives, the Company selects and periodically reviews counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure with respect to each counterparty, and monitors their respective market positions. However, if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the Company and were unable to meet their obligations, any transactions with the counterparty could be subject to early termination, which could result in substantial losses for the Company.
Cash Flow Hedges
Historically, LivaNova entered into interest rate swaps associated with the Initial Term Facility, which qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges. The Company’s outstanding interest rate swaps expired on April 6, 2023. LivaNova elected not to renew the interest rate swaps. Interest expense associated with the Initial Term Facility is principally offset by holding proceeds from the Term Facilities in a depository account, which earns a floating rate of interest.

For the classification of inputs used to evaluate the fair value of LivaNova’s derivatives, refer to “Note 8. Fair Value Measurements.”
Note 8. Fair Value Measurements
LivaNova reviews its fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities in the fair value hierarchy. Excluding LivaNova’s investment in Ceribell, Inc., as discussed in “Note 6. Investments,” there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.

The embedded and capped call derivatives are classified as Level 3 because the Company uses historical volatility and implied volatility from actual options traded to determine expected stock price volatility, an unobservable input that is significant to the valuation. In general, an increase in LivaNova’s stock price or stock price volatility would increase the fair value of the embedded and capped call derivatives, which would result in an increase in net expense. As the remaining time to the expiration of the derivatives decreases, the fair value of the derivatives decreases. The future impact of the derivatives on net income depends on how significant inputs such as stock price, stock price volatility, and time to the expiration of the derivatives change in relation to other inputs.

The ALung business combination involved a contingent consideration arrangement composed of potential cash payments upon the achievement of certain sales-based thresholds associated with sales of products. The ALung contingent consideration was subject to a one-time phase-out payment of $
13.8
 million, in the event that LivaNova were to cease operations of ALung. In January 2024, LivaNova announced the wind down of ACS, including ALung, as part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, and as a result, the ALung contingent consideration phase-out payment amount of $
13.8
 million was paid during 2024.
The ImThera business combination involved contingent consideration arrangements comprised of potential cash payments upon the achievement of a certain regulatory milestone and a sales-based earnout associated with sales of products. The sales-based earnouts are valued using projected sales from LivaNova’s internal strategic plan.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
LivaNova’s investments in equity securities of non-consolidated affiliates without readily determinable fair values are reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. LivaNova’s investments in non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, and PP&E are measured at fair value if there is an indication of impairment and adjusted to the new fair value when an impairment is recognized. LivaNova classifies the measurement input for these assets as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.
Other
The carrying value of LivaNova’s long-term debt including the current portion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
627.0
 million and $
586.0
 million, respectively. The fair value of the 2025 Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
58.7
 million and $
314.4
 million, respectively. The fair value of the 2029 Notes as of December 31, 2024 was $
343.7
 million. For all other long-term debt obligations, LivaNova believes the carrying value approximates fair value. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity.
The carrying values of LivaNova’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these items.

Revolving Credit and Term Facilities
The outstanding principal amount of LivaNova’s short-term unsecured revolving credit agreements and other agreements with various banks was $
0.7
 million and $
0.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an average interest rate of 
4.64
% and loan terms ranging from overnight to 
364
 days as of December 31, 2024.
On March 8, 2024, LivaNova and LivaNova USA entered into Incremental Facility Amendment No. 3, which provides for LivaNova USA to obtain revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $
225.0
 million. The $
225.0
 million revolving facility is subject to the terms and conditions of the 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended thereof, and replaced the previously existing $
125.0
 million revolving facility under the 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement. The $
225.0
 million revolving facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes and, if drawn, can be repaid at any time without premium or penalty. The $
225.0
 million revolving facility matures on March 8, 2029. There were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under the revolving facilities under the 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended, also requires the payment of certain commitment fees on the unused portion of the commitments, at a variable percentage based on LivaNova’s Total Net Leverage Ratio. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the applicable commitment fee percentage was 
0.5
% per annum.
On July 6, 2022, LivaNova and its wholly-owned subsidiary, LivaNova USA, entered into Incremental Facility Amendment No. 2, which provides for LivaNova USA to, among other things, obtain commitments for term loan facilities from a syndicate of lenders in an aggregate principal amount of $
350
 million consisting of (i) the Initial Term Facility with an aggregate principal amount of $
300
 million and (ii) the Delayed Draw Term Facility with an additional aggregate principal amount of $
50
 million. On April 6, 2023, LivaNova drew $
50
 million under the Delayed Draw Term Facility for general corporate purposes.
Proceeds from the Initial Term Facility were used to repay in full the Bridge Loan Facility on July 6, 2022, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes of the Company. The Term Facilities have a maturity of the earlier of (i) 
five years
 or (ii) 
91
 days prior to December 15, 2025, the maturity date of the 2025 Notes, unless by that date LivaNova USA will have either redeemed or refinanced the 2025 Notes, or set aside an amount of cash equal to the then-outstanding principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The Term Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted term SOFR plus a variable margin based on the Company’s consolidated total net leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable margin over adjusted term SOFR was equal to 
3.25
% per annum. The Term Facilities are subject to an original issue discount of 
1.5
% of their principal amount. The Term Facilities are subject to quarterly principal repayment, based on the following amortization schedule: (i) during the first year from the initial funding date: 
1.9
%; (ii) year two: 
5.0
%; (iii) year three: 
5.0
%; (iv) year four: 
7.5
%; and (v) year five: 
10.0
%, with the remainder to be paid at maturity. The effective interest rate of the Term Facilities at December 31, 2024 was 
6.53
%.
The 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended, contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including the requirement to maintain a Senior Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio of not more than 
3.50
 to 1.00, calculated as the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Net Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date and an Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than 
2.00
 to 1.00, calculated as the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, both as defined in the credit agreement, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the 2021 First Lien Credit Agreement.
Debt discount and issuance costs related to the Initial Term Facility were $
9.6
 million. The unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the Initial Term Facility were $
4.8
 million and $
6.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

2029 Notes Issuance and 2025 Notes Repurchase Transactions
On March 8, 2024, LivaNova issued $
345.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.50
% notes due 2029 by private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, which included exercise in full of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional $
45.0
 million principal amount of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company used part of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes to repurchase $
230.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate cash repurchase consideration of $
270.5
 million.
The 2025 Notes Repurchase Transaction was treated as a debt extinguishment. The carrying value of the related 2025 Notes, which included the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs and the fair value of the embedded derivative, was derecognized, and the 2029 Notes issued were recognized at fair value. The difference between the consideration used to extinguish the 2025 Notes, the carrying value of the 2025 Notes, and the fair value of the embedded derivative was recognized as a loss on debt extinguishment of $
25.5
 million on LivaNova’s consolidated statements of income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2024. Third-party costs incurred directly related to the 2025 Notes Repurchase Transaction were deferred and capitalized as additional debt issuance costs to be amortized on the 2029 Notes.
Contemporaneously with the 2025 Notes Repurchase Transaction, the Company and the financial institutions party to the 2025 Capped Calls agreed to terminate a portion of the 2025 Capped Calls in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of 2025 Notes repurchased. The Company received $
22.5
 million in cash consideration, the fair value of the terminated portion, upon settlement. The terms of the remaining 2025 Capped Calls remain unchanged and are classified as current derivative assets. For additional information on LivaNova’s embedded and capped call derivative instruments, refer to “Note 7. Derivatives and Risk Management.”
2029 Notes
The sale of the 2029 Notes resulted in $
332.1
 million in net proceeds to the Company after deducting issuance costs. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The effective interest rate of the 2029 Notes was 
9.84
% as of December 31, 2024. The 2029 Notes mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted.
Debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2029 Notes were $
99.6
 million, including $
87.5
 million of discount attributable to the embedded derivative and $
12.1
 million of new debt issuance costs related to the 2029 Notes. The debt discount and issuance costs are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2029 Notes. The unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2029 Notes as of December 31, 2024 were $
87.0
 million.
Holders are entitled to convert the 2029 Notes at any time during specified periods, at their option, subject to certain conditions. This includes the right to convert the 2029 Notes during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price, or $
90.22
 per share, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 14.4085 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $
69.40
 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, as set forth in the indenture governing the 2029 Notes.
As of December 31, 2024, the conditions for conversion were not met. As a result, the Company included its obligations from the 2029 Notes and the associated embedded derivative as long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, and the 2029 Notes are not convertible during the three months ending March 31, 2025.
Upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes, LivaNova will be required to pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be converted and may elect to settle the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes being converted in cash, shares, or a combination of the two.
On or after December 15, 2028, holders may convert their 2029 Notes at their option at any time until the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day (as defined in the indenture governing the 2029 Notes) immediately preceding the maturity date.
The Company may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at its option on or after March 22, 2027 for cash if the last reported sale price of LivaNova’s ordinary share has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price, or $
90.22
 per share, then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. Additionally, the Company may redeem the 2029 Notes at its option, prior to the stated maturity, in whole but not in part, in connection with certain tax-related events.
F-26
Holders may require the Company to repurchase their 2029 Notes upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2029 Notes) at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, in connection with certain corporate events or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2029 Notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period.
The indenture governing the 2029 Notes contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee (as defined in the indenture governing the 2029 Notes) or holders of at least 
25
% in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the 2029 Notes, and accrued and unpaid interest on such 2029 Notes, to be immediately due and payable. Upon events of default in connection with specified bankruptcy events involving the Company, the 2029 Notes will become due and payable immediately.
2025 Notes
On June 17, 2020, LivaNova USA issued $
287.5
 million aggregate principal amount of 
3.00
% notes due 2025 by private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The sale of the 2025 Notes resulted in $
278.0
 million in net proceeds to the Company after deducting issuance costs. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. On March 8, 2024, in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the Company used part of the net proceeds to repurchase $
230.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions. For additional information, refer to “2029 Notes Issuance and 2025 Notes Repurchase Transactions” above. The effective interest rate of the 2025 Notes was 
9.95
% at December 31, 2024. The 2025 Notes mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased, or redeemed.
Debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes were $
82.0
 million, including $
75.0
 million of discount attributable to the embedded derivative and $
7.0
 million of allocated issuance costs to the 2025 Notes related to legal, bank, and accounting fees. The debt discount and issuance costs are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Notes. Upon the closing of the 2025 Notes Repurchase Transaction in March 2024, the remaining unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes were $
5.8
 million. The unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
3.6
 million and $
32.0
 million, respectively.
Holders are entitled to exchange the 2025 Notes at any time during specified periods, at their option, subject to certain conditions. This includes the right to exchange the 2025 Notes during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the exchange price, or $
79.27
 per share, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The 2025 Notes are exchangeable solely into cash and are not exchangeable into ordinary shares of LivaNova or any other security under any circumstances. The initial exchange rate for the 2025 Notes is 16.3980 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of $
60.98
 per share). The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, as set forth in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes.
As of December 31, 2024, the conditions for exchange were not met. The Company included its obligations from the 2025 Notes and the associated embedded derivative as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, and the 2025 Notes are not exchangeable during the three months ending March 31, 2025.
On or after September 15, 2025, holders may exchange their 2025 Notes at their option at any time until the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day (as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes) immediately preceding the maturity date.

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies 
Saluggia Site Hazardous Substances
LSM, formerly a subsidiary of Sorin, one of the companies that merged into LivaNova PLC in 2015, manages site services for the campus in Saluggia, Italy. In addition to being a former LivaNova manufacturing facility, the Saluggia campus is also the location of manufacturing facilities of third parties, a cafeteria for workers, and storage facilities for hazardous substances and equipment previously used in a nuclear research center, later turned nuclear medicine business, between the 1960s and the late 
F-28
1990s. Pursuant to authorization from the Italian government, LSM performs ordinary maintenance, secures the facilities, monitors air and water quality, and files applicable reports with the competent environmental authorities.
In 2020, LSM received correspondence from ISIN requesting that, within 
five years
, LSM demonstrate the financial capacity to meet its obligations under Italian law to clean and dismantle any contaminated buildings and equipment, as well as to deliver hazardous substances to a national repository. The national repository will be built by the Italian government at a location and time yet to be determined. ISIN subsequently published Technical Guide n. 30, which identifies the technical criteria, and general safety and protection requirements for the design, construction, operation, and dismantling of temporary storage facilities for the hazardous substances.
Although there is no legal obligation to deliver the hazardous substances, as the performance of these obligations is contingent on the construction of the as-yet unbuilt national repository, based on the aforementioned factors, the Company concluded its obligation to clean, dismantle, and deliver any hazardous substances to a national repository is probable and reasonably estimable. The estimated liability as of December 31, 2024 was $
36.7
 million (€
35.4
 million), which represents the estimated low end of the range of loss, with an estimated maximum end of the range of loss of $
49.2
 million (€
47.4
 million). The estimated liability as of December 31, 2023 was $
39.7
 million (€
35.8
 million).
SNIA Environmental Litigation
Sorin was created as a result of a spin-off from SNIA in 2004, and in 2015, Sorin was merged into LivaNova. SNIA subsequently became insolvent, and the Public Administrations sought compensation from SNIA in an aggregate amount of approximately $
3.6
 billion for remediation costs relating to the environmental damage at chemical sites previously operated by SNIA’s other subsidiaries.
There are proceedings relating to the SNIA bankruptcy to which LivaNova is not a party in the Bankruptcy Court of Udine and the Bankruptcy Court of Milan. In 2011, the Bankruptcy Court of Udine held that the Public Administrations were not creditors of either SNIA or its subsidiaries in connection with their claims in the Italian insolvency proceedings. The Public Administrations appealed. In 2016, the Court of Udine rejected the appeal, and the Public Administrations appealed to the Italian Supreme Court. Similarly, in 2014, the Bankruptcy Court of Milan held that the Public Administrations were not creditors of either SNIA or its subsidiaries. The Public Administrations appealed. In April 2022, the Bankruptcy Court of Milan declared the Public Administrations to be a non-privileged creditor of SNIA for up to €
454
 million, and the Public Administrations appealed to the Italian Supreme Court.
In 2012, SNIA filed a civil action against Sorin in the Civil Court of Milan asserting joint liability of a parent and a spun-off company; the Public Administrations entered voluntarily into the proceeding, asking Sorin, as jointly liable with SNIA, to pay compensation for SNIA’s environmental damages. In 2016, the Court of Milan dismissed all legal actions of SNIA and of the Public Administrations further requiring the Public Administrations to pay Sorin €
292,000
 ($
303,000
 as of December 31, 2024) for legal fees. The Public Administrations appealed the 2016 Decision to the Court of Appeal. On March 5, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a partial decision on the merits declaring Sorin/LivaNova jointly liable with SNIA for SNIA’s environmental liabilities in an amount up to the fair value of the net worth received by Sorin because of the spin-off of Sorin from SNIA in 2024, an estimated €
572.1
 million ($
593.7
 million as of December 31, 2024). LivaNova appealed the partial decision on liability to the Italian Supreme Court in August 2019.
In 2021, the Court of Appeal delivered the remainder of its decision, ordering LivaNova to pay damages of €
453.6
 million ($
470.7
 million as of December 31, 2024). LivaNova appealed the decision on damages in December 2021. On February 21, 2022, the Court of Appeal notified the Company that it granted the Company a suspension with respect to the payment of damages until a decision has been reached on the appeal to the Italian Supreme Court. This suspension was subject to LivaNova providing a first demand bank guarantee of €
270.0
 million ($
280.2
 million as of December 31, 2024) within 
30
 calendar days, and on March 21, 2022, LivaNova delivered the guarantee, thereby satisfying the condition. For additional information on the financing of the guarantee, refer to “Note 18. Supplemental Financial Information.”
In 2022, in response to one of a number of appeals asserted by LivaNova, the Italian Supreme Court issued an ordinance, a procedural document, whereby the Italian Supreme Court referred a question on interpretation of a European directive on demergers to the ECJ. Specifically, the ordinance asked the ECJ to provide a binding decision as to whether a company resulting from a demerger can be held jointly and severally liable not only for the established liabilities of the demerged company that were articulated at the time of demerger, but also for the environmental liabilities of the demerged company that materialized after the demerger which are derived from actions performed prior to the demerger. On July 29, 2024, the ECJ issued a judgment in response to the ordinance. The ECJ judgment states that a demerged company can be held responsible for liabilities not established prior to a demerger as long as the liabilities derive from the conduct of a demerged company prior to the demerger. The ECJ judgment also states that national law should determine whether liability for damages stemming from 
F-29
conduct after a demerger can be assigned to a demerged company. The Italian Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a public hearing on February 26, 2025. While the Company does not anticipate a decision at the hearing, it expects a decision in response to all of the appeals of LivaNova and counter-appeals submitted by the Public Administrations during the first half of 2025. LivaNova has not recognized a liability in connection with this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable.
Product Liability Litigation
The Company continues to be involved in litigation involving LivaNova’s 3T device. The litigation includes the cases remaining in the MDL, various U.S. state court cases, and claims in jurisdictions outside the United States. As of February 25, 2025, the Company was aware of approximately 
60
 filed and unfiled claims worldwide. The complaints generally seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation or concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer protection statutes.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, LivaNova recorded an additional liability of $
19.7
 million, $
34.5
 million, and $
22.3
 million, respectively, upon receipt of new information regarding the nature of certain claims. As of December 31, 2024, the provision for these matters was $
15.8
 million. While the amount accrued represents LivaNova’s best estimate for those worldwide filed and unfiled claims of which LivaNova is aware and believes are both probable and estimable at this time, the actual liability for resolution of these matters may vary from the Company’s provision. For any claims where a potential loss is not determined to be probable, or a potential loss or range of potential loss is not reasonably estimable at this time, a provision has not been recorded.

Italian MedTech Payback Measure
In 2015, the Italian Parliament introduced rules regarding public contracts with the National Healthcare System for the supply of goods and services. In particular, the law introduced a payback measure requiring companies selling medical devices in Italy to repay a percentage of the healthcare expenditures exceeding the regional maximum caps for medical devices. In August 2022, a decree was published which provided guidance and timetables for the rule. In response, LivaNova filed an appeal at the Administrative Court against the Decree of the Ministry of Health, assessing the amount payable and against the payback law. LivaNova also filed appeals against the regions requesting payments. In August 2023, the Administrative Court upheld LivaNova’s request to suspend the effect of the requests for payment by the regions, pending the decision by the Administrative Court on the merits of the case. In November 2023, the Administrative Court, in a separate matter, asked the Constitutional Court whether the payback law was compliant with the Italian Constitution and pending the decision by the Constitutional Court, all cases brought by medical device companies in this matter were suspended. On July 22, 2024, the Constitutional Court 
F-30
determined that the payback law is compliant with the Italian Constitution and that companies may reduce their payment obligations between 2015-2018 to 48% of the amount originally charged to companies. Based on market and product information, as previously disclosed, and the recent ruling by the Constitutional Court, the amount reserved for this matter was $
16.0
 million and $
8.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets. However, the actual liability could vary. Amounts recognized associated with the Italian MedTech payback measure are recorded as a reduction to net revenue in the consolidated statements of income (loss).
Cyber Litigation
In connection with the cybersecurity incident initially reported on November 20, 2023, LivaNova USA was named as a defendant in 
six
 putative class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in June and July 2024. Those cases were consolidated in a single action, and the plaintiffs filed against LivaNova USA a consolidated class action complaint, which asserted claims of negligence, breach of contract, and violation of various state consumer protection laws. The plaintiffs sought damages, equitable/injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses, among other relief. The parties entered into mediation and have agreed to a settlement, for which the Company recorded an accrual of $
1.2
 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The settlement has received preliminary approval from the Court, and the Company expects all settlement activities to be completed in 2025. 
In addition, HHS’s Office for Civil Rights is investigating the incident pursuant to its authority to enforce the HIPAA rules regarding privacy, security, and breach notification. The Office for Civil Rights issued a request for information regarding the Company’s response to the incident and the Company’s compliance with HIPAA rules, to which the Company responded. The Office for Civil Rights may issue additional requests for information and documentation. In connection with its investigation, the Office for Civil Rights may, among other measures, seek to impose civil monetary penalties against LivaNova and seek to require that the Company implement a corrective action plan.
Other Matters
Additionally, LivaNova is the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of LivaNova’s business. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable and that may not be known for extended periods of time. Since the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the costs associated with them could have a material adverse effect on LivaNova’s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Note 14. Employee Retirement Plans
Defined Benefit Plans
LivaNova sponsors several defined benefit pension plans, which include plans in the U.S., Italy, Germany, Japan, and France. The Company maintains a frozen cash balance retirement plan in the U.S. that is a contributory, defined benefit plan designed to provide the benefit in terms of a stated account balance dependent on the employer’s promised interest-crediting rate. In Italy and France, LivaNova maintains a severance pay defined benefit plan that obligates the employer to pay a severance payment in case of resignation, dismissal, or retirement. In other jurisdictions, LivaNova sponsors non-contributory, defined benefit plans designated to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to eligible employees.
Risks Related to Defined Benefit Plans
The defined benefit plans expose LivaNova to various demographic and economic risks such as longevity risk, investment risks, currency and interest rate risks, and in some cases inflation risk. Pension fund Trustees are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets. In general, Trustees manage pension fund risks by diversifying the investments of plan assets and in some cases by matching the interest rate risk of liabilities in whole or in part.
The Company has an active de-risking strategy in which it consistently looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined benefit plans. The plans are governed by Trustees who have a legal obligation to evenly balance the interests of all stakeholders and operate under the local regulatory framework.

To determine the discount rate for LivaNova’s U.S. benefit plan, the Company used the FTSE Above Median Pension Discount Curve. For the discount rate used for non-U.S. benefit plans, LivaNova considers local market expectations of long-term returns, primarily utilizing the iBoxx Corporate Index Bond rating AA, duration higher than 10 years. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for LivaNova’s U.S. defined benefit plan was derived from a study conducted by the Company’s investment managers. The study includes a review of the anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and considers the appropriate asset allocation strategy, given the anticipated funding requirements of the plan, to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested.
Retirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy
In the U.S., LivaNova has an account that holds the defined benefit frozen balance pension plan assets. The Plan Committee sets investment guidelines for the U.S. pension plan. Plan assets in the U.S. are invested in accordance with sound investment practices that emphasize long-term fundamentals. The investment objective for the plan assets in the U.S. is to achieve a positive rate of return that would be expected to close the current funding deficit and enable LivaNova to terminate the frozen pension plan at a reasonable cost. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. The plan investments consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income and equity index funds. Securities are also diversified in terms of investment location (domestic and international), tenor (short- and long-term securities), investment objective (growth and value), and size of market.
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is a significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations influence the funding and investment allocation process in each country.

Retirement Benefit Fair Values
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:
Equity Mutual Funds:
 Valued based on the year-end net asset values of the investment vehicles. The net asset values of the investment vehicles are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the mutual funds valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. Equity mutual funds have a daily reported net asset value.
Fixed Income Mutual Funds:
 Valued based on the year-end net asset values of the investment vehicles. The net asset values of the investment vehicles are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the mutual funds valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.
Money Markets:
 Valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation
LivaNova PLC is resident in the UK for tax purposes. LivaNova’s subsidiaries conduct operations and earn income in numerous countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, and the income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which LivaNova’s subsidiaries conduct operations vary. As a result of the changes in the overall level of the Company’s income, the earnings mix in various jurisdictions, and the changes in tax laws, LivaNova’s consolidated effective income tax rate may vary from one reporting period to another.
LivaNova is subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes in the U.S., the UK, the EU, and various other jurisdictions. LivaNova continues to monitor the adoption of Pillar Two by the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. The UK has enacted legislation providing for a minimum effective tax rate of 15% through a multinational top-up tax and a domestic top-up tax for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Since LivaNova does not have significant operations in jurisdictions with tax rates below 15%, the multinational top-up tax and domestic top-up taxes under Pillar Two 
F-40
do not have a material impact on the effective rate for 2024. LivaNova will continue to monitor legislative developments and related guidance in the UK and other jurisdictions that may impact LivaNova’s operations.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to LivaNova’s effective income tax rate expressed as a percentage of income (loss) before income tax:

LivaNova reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets by jurisdictions at each balance sheet date by weighing the positive and negative evidence including cumulative losses and impacts of transactions or other events. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, LivaNova had valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $
158.8
 million and $
182.5
 million, respectively. These valuation allowances were primarily related to continuing operations and are a result of significant negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions. The decrease in valuation allowance primarily relates to the release of valuation allowances in Italy of $
13.0
 million for 2024 and in the UK of $
110.8
 million for 2023, partially offset by continued valuation allowance accruals in the U.S., Brazil and other countries. Any changes to the realizability of the deferred tax assets due to transactions and other events in 2025 will be accounted for during the quarter in which they occur.

No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 because it is LivaNova’s intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. In the event of the distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends, a sale of the subsidiaries, or certain other transactions, LivaNova may be liable for income taxes and withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2024, it was not practicable to determine the exact amount of the deferred tax liability related to those investments.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions
LivaNova operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex legal and tax regulatory environments, and the Company’s tax returns are periodically audited or subjected to review by tax authorities. LivaNova monitors tax law changes and the potential impact on its results of operations. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions LivaNova has taken and assess additional taxes. LivaNova regularly assesses the likely outcomes of the Company’s tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of its reserves for uncertain tax positions. However, there can be no assurance that LivaNova will accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and the actual outcome of an audit could have a material impact on LivaNova’s consolidated results of income, financial position, or cash flows.

Note 17. Geographic and Segment Information
Segment Information
LivaNova identifies operating segments based on how it manages, evaluates, and internally reports its business activities to allocate resources, develop, and execute its strategy and assess performance. Prior to 2024, LivaNova operated through 
three
 segments: Cardiopulmonary, Neuromodulation, and ACS. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company reorganized its operating and reporting structure upon initiating the 2024 Restructuring Plan. This involved transitioning all ACS standalone cannulae and accessories, including ProtekDuo and transseptal (TandemHeart) cannulae, into its Cardiopulmonary segment. Operations for other ACS products, including LifeSPARC and Hemolung systems, were discontinued in 2024. For additional information, refer to “Note 4. Restructuring.” This restructuring, along with changes in how the Company’s CODM regularly reviews information, allocates resources, and assesses performance, resulted in modifications to LivaNova’s reportable segments. Specifically, LivaNova’s former ACS segment is now included in “Other,” excluding the ACS standalone cannulae and accessories business, which is now included in the Cardiopulmonary reportable segment. As a result, LivaNova now has 
two
 reportable segments: Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation. The segment financial information presented herein reflects these changes for all periods presented.
LivaNova’s Cardiopulmonary segment is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of cardiopulmonary products, including HLMs, oxygenators, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae, and other related accessories.
LivaNova’s Neuromodulation segment is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of devices that deliver neuromodulation therapy for treating DRE and DTD. Neuromodulation products include the VNS Therapy System, which consists of an implantable pulse generator, a lead that connects the generator to the vagus nerve, and other accessories. It also includes the development and management of clinical testing of LivaNova’s aura6000 System for treating OSA. LivaNova’s Neuromodulation segment also includes costs associated with the Company’s former heart failure program, which the Company wound down during 2023.
