SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
●
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. To date, we have generated approximately $227.6 million from product sales. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability.
●
We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. 
●
Our Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners, our license agreement with LGC, and our other agreements, could restrict our ability to commercialize IMCIVREE, limit cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
●
We have only one approved 
product, which is still in clinical development in additional indications, 
and we may not be successful in any future efforts to identify and develop additional product candidates. 
●
The successful commercialization of IMCIVREE and any other product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payors provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for setmelanotide or our other product candidates, if any and if approved, could severely limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.
●
Positive results from early clinical trials of setmelanotide may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials of setmelanotide and preliminary data may not be predictive of final results. If we cannot generate positive results in our later clinical trials of setmelanotide, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize additional indications for setmelanotide. 
●
The number of patients with each of the MC4R pathway deficiencies is very small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients with any of these conditions is

smaller than we had estimated, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability will be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, our ability to recruit patients to our trials may be materially adversely affected
. Patient enrollment may also be adversely affected by competition and other factors.
●
Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of our planned clinical trials of setmelanotide could result in increased costs to us and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.
●
Changes in regulatory requirements and, guidance in the United States or abroad, or unanticipated events during our clinical trials of setmelanotide may occur, which may result in changes to clinical trial protocols or additional clinical trial requirements, which could result in increased costs to us and could delay our development timeline. Additionally, it may be necessary to validate different or additional instruments for measuring subjective symptoms, and to show that setmelanotide has a clinically meaningful impact on specified endpoints in order to obtain regulatory approval.
●
Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the regulatory and marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining additional approvals for the 
4

Table of Contents
commercialization of setmelanotide. We depend entirely on the success of setmelanotide, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional regulatory approvals for, or successfully commercialize, setmelanotide. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required additional regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize setmelanotide in additional indications in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.
●
Our approach to treating patients with MC4R pathway deficiencies requires the identification of patients with unique genetic subtypes, for example, POMC genetic deficiency. The FDA or other equivalent competent authorities in foreign jurisdictions could require the clearance, approval or CE marking of an in vitro companion diagnostic device to ensure appropriate selection of patients as a condition of approving setmelanotide in additional indications. The requirement that we obtain clearance, approval or CE marking of an in vitro companion diagnostic device would require substantial financial resources, and could delay or prevent the receipt of additional regulatory approvals for setmelanotide, or adversely affect those we have already obtained.
●
Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved labeling or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. 
●
Our CHI program remains in the discovery stage and although we intend to identify an investigational candidate in 2025, we cannot be assured that we will ever successfully develop and commercialize a CHI product candidate.
●
If the third parties we rely on, and will continue to rely on, do not successfully carry out their contractual obligations or meet expected timelines, we may not be able to obtain additional regulatory approvals for or continue to commercialize setmelanotide and our business could be materially adversely affected. 
●
Our industry is intensely competitive. If we are not able to compete effectively against current and future competitors, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of IMCIVREE, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer. 
●
If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect setmelanotide or our other product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
●
Global events, such as pandemics, economic, political and regulatory changes and uncertainties, have and may continue to adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other commercialization prospects.

Item 1. Busines

Overview
We are a global, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. We are focused on advancing our melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists, including our lead asset, IMCIVREE
®
 (setmelanotide), as precision medicines designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by rare MC4R pathway diseases. While obesity affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, we are developing therapies for a subset of individuals who have hyperphagia, a pathological, insatiable hunger and impaired satiety accompanied by persistent and abnormal food-seeking behaviors, decreased energy expenditure and severe obesity due to diseases such as acquired or congenital hypothalamic obesity, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or other diseases caused by impaired MC4R pathway signaling. The MC4R pathway is a neuro-endocrine pathway in the brain that is responsible for regulating hunger, caloric intake and energy expenditure, which consequently affect body weight. IMCIVREE, an MC4R agonist for which we hold worldwide rights, is the first-ever therapy that is marketed in the United States, European Union (EU), United Kingdom, Canada and several other countries and regions for certain rare MC4R pathway diseases, including BBS. 
Our late-stage clinical development program in acquired hypothalamic obesity presents a meaningful expansion opportunity for setmelanotide. Acquired hypothalamic obesity is a rapid-onset, severe obesity caused by injury to the hypothalamus, which may impair MC4R pathway signaling. We believe there are between 5,000 and 10,000 patients in United States living with acquired hypothalamic obesity with an annual incidence of 500 new cases, with similar prevalence and incidence in Europe, as well as between 5,000 and 8,000 patients in Japan. We believe this represents a significant global unmet need as there are no therapies specifically approved for hypothalamic obesity. With setmelanotide, we observed positive efficacy results in our Phase 2 trial, with a clinically meaningful BMI reduction of 25.5% in 11 patients who reached 12 months or more on therapy through the extension phase of the trial. In addition, similar positive data suggesting potential efficacy have been reported from a pre-approval, early-access program in France. We have completed enrollment in our Phase 3 trial in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity and we are on track to disclose topline data in the second quarter of 2025. During the first quarter of 2025, we completed enrollment in a supplemental, 12-patient Japanese cohort of the global Phase 3 trial in acquired hypothalamic obesity designed to enable potential registration of setmelanotide in Japan for this rare disease. In addition, we added an independent substudy to our ongoing global trial, in order to evaluate setmelanotide in patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity, a rare disease caused by certain brain abnormalities that may impair the function of the MC4R pathway, with enrollment of the first patients in this substudy expected in the first quarter of 2025. Our preliminary estimate of the prevalence of congenital hypothalamic obesity is in excess of 1,000 patients in the United States with a similar prevalence in Europe, and this is in addition to the prevalence for acquired hypothalamic obesity above. 
For IMCIVREE, which was first approved in the United States in 2020, we have demonstrated success in achieving regulatory approvals and securing market access in approved indications in more than 15 countries in addition to the United States, and we continue to seek access in additional markets. IMCIVREE is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with syndromic or monogenic obesity due to BBS or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in 
POMC, PCSK1
, or 
LEPR
 genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS). The European Commission (EC) and the United Kingdom’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized IMCIVREE for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 2 years of age and above. 
With our efforts in hypothalamic obesity and other potential indications, we are advancing what we believe is the most comprehensive clinical research and development program ever initiated in MC4R pathway diseases, with multiple 
6

Table of Contents
ongoing and planned clinical trials.  Our MC4R pathway program is designed to expand the total number of patients who we believe could benefit from setmelanotide therapy or from one of our new drug candidates. Our Phase 3 EMANATE trial, comprised of four independent substudies evaluating setmelanotide in genetically caused MC4R pathway diseases, is ongoing. Following the completion of our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial, we identified six genetically-defined cohorts that we believe merit further investigation for potential setmelanotide efficacy. We also are evaluating setmelanotide for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in a 26-week, open-label Phase 2 trial which was initiated at a single site in the United States during the first quarter of 2025. 
In addition to setmelanotide, we have two earlier-stage investigational MC4R agonists in clinical development, RM-718, designed for weekly administration, and bivamelagon (formerly LB54640), an oral small molecule, which are each advancing in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, respectively. These investigational assets are designed to be highly selective for the MC4R and MC1R sparing and thereby not cause hyperpigmentation. We completed enrollment in our Phase 2 trial evaluating bivamelagon, in acquired hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025. With RM-718, we anticipate initiating Part C of our Phase 1 trial to evaluate this weekly MC4R agonist in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025. 
We are leveraging what we believe is the largest known DNA database focused on obesity - with approximately 100,000 sequencing samples as of December 31, 2024 - to improve the understanding, diagnosis and care of people living with severe obesity due to certain variants in genes associated with the MC4R pathway. Our sequencing-based epidemiology estimates show that each of these genetically-defined MC4R pathway deficiencies are considered rare diseases, according to established definitions based on patient populations. Our epidemiology estimates are approximately 4,600 to 7,500 for U.S. patients in initial FDA-approved indications, including obesity due to BBS and biallelic POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiencies. Our epidemiology estimates for the two more prevalent indications being studied in our Phase 3 EMANATE trial (SH2B1 and POMC/PCSK1) suggest that approximately 29,000 U.S. patients with one of these genetically driven obesities have the potential to respond well to setmelanotide. Similarly, our epidemiology estimates for patients with genetic indications who demonstrated an initial response following stage 1 of our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial is approximately 65,300. All these patients face similar challenges as other patients with rare diseases, namely lack of awareness, resources, tests, tools and especially therapeutic options. 
We are working to expand access to IMCIVREE globally. Our disease awareness and patient finding efforts are aligned with a singular focus on building a community of caregivers and healthcare providers focused on transforming the treatment of these diseases. We have multiple field teams in the United States and Europe engaging with physicians who treat patients with severe obesity, and we plan to build out our own team in Japan in preparation for potential registration of setmelanotide for acquired hypothalamic obesity. We continue to bring together health care providers, patients and families with educational and awareness events. Our genetic testing programs fuel MC4R pathway research, disease education and awareness and patient finding.
With 283 employees, including 76 employees in 11 countries outside of North America, as of February 1, 2025, an ever-expanding network of key opinion leaders, and an increasing number of identified, diagnosed and treated patients, we are focused on changing the paradigm for the treatment of rare MC4R pathway diseases. Our focused disease awareness and patient finding efforts fuel the key elements of our strategy, including:
1.
Prepare for potential global launch of IMCIVREE in hypothalamic obesity
: With topline data in our Phase 3 pivotal trial on track to be disclosed in the second quarter of 2025, we are focused on efficiently analyzing that data, and submitting regulatory filings in the United States, the EU and the United Kingdom – to be followed by a regulatory submission in Japan - and preparing for global commercialization, if approved.
2.
Continue to increase global access to IMCIVREE
: With access for IMCIVREE achieved in more than 15 countries in addition to the United States for BBS and/or POMC and LEPR deficiencies, we remain focused on community building programs, disease awareness and education efforts, patient finding and securing

reimbursement. We continue to seek market access for IMCIVREE on a country-by-country basis in Europe and additional international markets.
3.
Advance MC4R-focused pipeline
:  Our clinical development programs are designed to expand the overall patient population that we believe may benefit from MC4R agonism, both in additional disease states and next generation assets. Life-cycle management is a key driver for advancing our pipeline. Bivamelagon and RM-718, which are being evaluated in the clinic for hypothalamic obesity, have composition of matter patent protection in the United States out to 2040 (with the possibility of patent term extension out to 2045) and 2036 (with the possibility of patent term extension out to 2041), respectively, provided, however, that in each case the maximum patent term extension is 14 years following initial FDA approval, so the ultimate patent term extension date could be earlier, depending on the first approval date for each product candidate. In addition to our pivotal trial evaluating setmelanotide in hypothalamic obesity, our Phase 3 EMANATE trial and our Phase 2 PWS trial with setmelanotide are ongoing, and therefore may add significant opportunity to the total addressable market for our first-generation MC4R agonist. In addition, we are advancing new product candidates for congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare genetic disease.

Market Overview
Severe Obesity, Hyperphagia, and the MC4R Pathway
Rare MC4R pathway diseases are distinct from general obesity. The hallmark characteristics of rare MC4R pathway diseases are severe obesity and hyperphagia, a pathological and insatiable hunger that drives a severe preoccupation with food and extreme food-seeking behaviors. Lifestyle interventions are not therapeutic in patients with these diseases because they fail to address the underlying genetic or acquired impairment of central energy regulation and satiety.
Accordingly, the discovery that the MC4R pathway regulates both energy intake (hunger) and energy expenditure has made it an important target for therapeutics. Studies have shown that injuries to the hypothalamus region of the brain in patients with certain tumors impair MC4R signaling, leading to increased hunger, reduced energy expenditure and rapid onset of severe obesity. In addition to obesity due to BBS and POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiencies, recent advances in genetic studies have identified several diseases characterized at least in part with hyperphagia and early-onset, severe obesity that appear to be the result of genetic variants affecting the MC4R pathway, including certain variants of the 
POMC, PCSK1, LEPR, SRC1
 and 
SH2B1
 genes, as well as MC4R deficiency obesity and deficiencies in many additional genes with strong or very strong relevance to the MC4R pathway. With a deeper understanding of this critical signaling pathway, we are taking a different approach to drug development by focusing on specific genetic variants and acquired injury affecting the MC4R pathway. We believe that this approach has the potential to provide clinically meaningful improvements in the treatment of rare obesity and hyperphagia by addressing lost function in the MC4R pathway.
Rare MC4R Pathway Diseases
The MC4R pathway has been the focus of extensive scientific investigation for many years. This neuro-endocrine pathway in the hypothalamus is a key signaling pathway responsible for regulating hunger,  caloric intake, and energy expenditure, which consequently affects body weight. It is known to be a critical component in the regulation of energy balance. The critical role of the MC4R pathway in weight regulation is supported by the observation that single gene variants at various points in this pathway may result in early-onset, severe obesity. 
The MC4R pathway is illustrated in the figure below. Under normal conditions, POMC neurons are activated by adiposity and satiety signals, including  the hormone leptin acting through the LEPR. POMC neurons produce a protein, which is processed by the PCSK1 enzyme, into melanocyte stimulating hormone, or MSH, the natural agonist, or activator of the MC4R. When upstream genetic variants, traumatic injuries or lesions disrupt this pathway, it can lead to insufficient MC4R activation and downstream signaling, the result of which can be hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure and severe obesity.

The figure below also illustrates some of the genes that are upstream of the MC4R and the potential effect variants in those genes can have on the activation of the MC4R, which regulates food intake and energy expenditure. 
MC4R Agonism Development Targets: Upstream Deficiencies Affecting the MC4R Pathway
AgRP, agouti-related protein; LEPR, leptin receptor; MC4R, melanocortin-4 receptor; MSH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PCSK1, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 1; POMC, proopiomelanocortin. Reference: Yazdi FT et al. PeerJ. 2015;3:e856.
We are focused on developing our MC4R agonists, including our lead asset setmelanotide, as a precision treatment for certain rare MC4R pathway diseases. In addition to acquired hypothalamic obesity, congenital hypothalamic obesity and PWS, we are evaluating setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity due to variants in one of a number of genes associated with the MC4R pathway. Setmelanotide has the potential to restore lost function in this pathway by activating the intact MC4R-expressing neuron downstream of the genetic impairment. In this way, we believe setmelanotide may act as restorative therapy, to restore lost signaling of the MC4R pathway.
Epidemiology Estimates of Rare MC4R Pathway Diseases
While obesity is a global epidemic, we are focused on rare MC4R pathway diseases. Impairment of the MC4R pathway is characterized by hyperphagia and rapid-onset obesity or the presence of early-onset, severe obesity. Of the tens of millions of individuals with obesity in the United States, the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are approximately 5 million individuals whose severe obesity had onset between the ages of 2 and 5 years old. The tables below summarizes the estimated prevalence for indications currently approved or under pivotal clinical investigation.  These calculations rely on internal and proprietary sequencing data and current estimated responder rates to setmelanotide therapy, and they assume a U.S. population of 327 million, of which 1.7% have early-onset, severe obesity (Hales et al in JAMA – April 2018: 
Trends in Obesity and Severe Obesity Prevalence in US Youth and Adults by Sex and Age
, 2007-2008 to 2015-2016).

For BBS, prevalence estimates vary between populations, from 1 in 100,000 in northern European populations with higher prevalence rates in some additional regions throughout the world. We estimate the number of patients with BBS in the United States is between 4,000 and 5,000, with a similar number in continental Europe and the United Kingdom (UK). These estimates are based on our patient identification efforts in the United States and Europe and our proprietary genetic sequencing data, as well as our belief that BBS, like most rare diseases, is underdiagnosed. We believe the BBS health care provider network in EU member states and the UK is particularly well-established and more advanced than in the United States, and based on field work, we believe there are approximately 1,500 patients diagnosed and being cared for at academic centers in Europe.  Applying these population-adjusted identified patient populations to the United States and other countries with comparable population genetics supports our epidemiology estimates. 
c.
For POMC or LEPR deficiencies, we estimate European prevalence is similar to the United States. While our sequencing data include patients from the United States and Europe, at the time, we did not have a comparable number of sequencing samples from European countries, and these estimates are therefore based on applying relative population percentages to the Rhythm-derived estimates described above.
Separately, in Canada, where IMCIVREE is approved for weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with obesity due to BBS or biallelic POMC, PSCK1 or LEPR deficiency, we estimated at the time of our filing for approval with Health Canada that there are approximately 300 – 400 individuals with BBS. This was based on data on file, a range of prevalence estimates for BBS in Canada between 1 in 125,000 to 1 in 160,000, and a population in Canada of 38,929,902 as of July 1, 2022, according to StatsCan. Also, our prevalence estimate accounted for a reported founder effect in the province of Newfoundland, where estimated prevalence is approximately 1 in 17,500 (Forsythe E, Beales PL. Eur J Hum Genet. 2013;21(1):8-13). The prevalence of POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiency obesity in Canada is not well characterized as very little data are available.

e.  Our European prevalence estimate for acquired hypothalamic obesity is limited to the EU4 (Germany, France, Spain, Italy), UK and the Netherlands. The total 2020 population estimates for the six key countries (EU4, the Netherlands, and UK) of 339,295,304 was used to reach a final prevalence of 0.1-0.3 in 10,000 patients. In addition, we estimate the prevalence of acquired hypothalamic obesity in Japan to be approximately 5,000 to 8,000 based on our review of tumor registries and claims data.  
f.  Epidemiology of congenital hypothalamic obesity is expected to be comparable between the United States and EU4 (Germany, France, Spain, Italy), United Kingdom and the Netherlands combined in the absence of specific regional data. Our internal Company estimate is driven mainly by septo-optic dysplasia (Garne, et al., European Journal of Medical Genetics 61(9):483–488, 2018. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmg.2018.05.010; and Cerbone, et al., EClinicalMedicine 19, 2020. doi: 10.1016/j.eclinm.2019.11.017.).
g.      For patients with genetic variants of the MC4R pathway, the rarity and the genetic pathophysiology of our target indications means that there is no comprehensive patient registry or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients. As a result, we have had to rely on other available sources to derive clinical prevalence estimates

for these monogenic indications. For the four rare MC4R pathway diseases we are studying on the Phase 3 EMANATE trial (POMC insufficiency, LEPR insufficiency, SRC1 deficiency and SH2B1 deficiency), we believe that the patient populations in continental Europe and UK are at least as large as those in the United States. While our sequencing data include patients from the United States and Europe, we do not have comparable sequencing data from European countries and these estimates are therefore based on applying relative population percentages to the Rhythm-derived estimates described above. Because the published epidemiology studies for these genetic deficiencies are based on relatively small population samples, and are not amenable to robust statistical analyses, it is possible that these projections may significantly under- or overestimate the addressable population. While our projected estimates of the aggregate total addressable population continue to expand with the addition of new genes, the addressable population faces the challenges of a rare disease population.

Limitations of Current Therapies
Although drugs approved for general obesity potentially can be used in patients with obesity and rare MC4R pathway diseases, other than IMCIVREE, all currently available products have limited efficacy and treat symptoms without addressing the underlying biology of MC4R impairment. For example, drugs which delay gastric emptying may cause a patient to feel full and eat less, but are also often associated with nausea and vomiting as a consequence of the delayed emptying. In the case of individuals with rare MC4R pathway diseases, these therapies also do not specifically address the impaired signaling in this central energy regulating pathway. Similarly, metabolic and bariatric surgery which has been shown to be quite effective in the general population with obesity, may be unsuccessful in patients with rare MC4R pathway diseases for the same reason.
MC4R Pathway Program
IMCIVREE
®
 (setmelanotide)
IMCIVREE is approved by the FDA to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with syndromic or monogenic obesity due to BBS, or POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in 
POMC, PCSK1
, or 
LEPR
 genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or VUS. The EC and United Kingdom’s MHRA have authorized setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 2 years of age and above. IMCIVREE also was approved by Health Canada, where it is indicated in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with impairments in the MC4R pathway due to genetic diseases, for the treatment of obesity and control of hunger in BBS or biallelic POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency. 
IMCIVREE is the only therapeutic specifically approved for patients with these diseases. As an MC4R agonist, IMCIVREE is designed to address impaired MC4R pathway activity arising due to genetic impairments upstream of the MC4R. IMCIVREE contains setmelanotide acetate, an MC4R agonist. Setmelanotide is an 8 amino acid cyclic peptide analog of endogenous melanocortin peptide α-MSH. The chemical name for setmelanotide acetate is acetyl-L-arginyl-L-cysteinyl-D-alanyl-L-histidinyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-L-tryptophanyl-L-cysteinamide cyclic (2→8)-disulfide

acetate. Its molecular formula is C49H68N18O9S2 (anhydrous, free-base), and molecular mass is 1117.3 Daltons (anhydrous, free-base).
The chemical structure of setmelanotide is:
IMCIVREE injection is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Each 1 mL of IMCIVREE contains 10 mg of setmelanotide provided as setmelanotide acetate, which is a salt with 2 to 4 molar equivalents of acetate, and the following inactive ingredients: 100 mg N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl- glycero-3- phosphoethanolamine sodium salt, 8 mg carboxymethylcellulose sodium (average MWt 90,500), 11 mg mannitol, 5 mg phenol, 10 mg benzyl alcohol, 1 mg edetate disodium dihydrate, and Water for Injection. The pH of IMCIVREE is 5 to 6.
Obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency are ultra-rare diseases caused by variants in 
POMC, PCSK1
 or 
LEPR
 genes that impair the MC4R pathway. People living with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency struggle with hyperphagia, an extreme, insatiable hunger, beginning at a young age and resulting in early-onset, severe obesity.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a life-threatening, ultra-rare orphan disease. BBS is a disease that causes hyperphagia and severe obesity beginning in early childhood, as well as vision loss, polydactyly, kidney abnormalities, and other signs and symptoms. For patients with BBS, hyperphagia and obesity can have significant health consequences. BBS is part of a class of disorders called ciliopathies, or disorders associated with the impairment of cilia function in cells. Cilia are hair-like cellular projections that play a fundamental role in the regulation of several biological processes, including satiety signaling. Cilia dysfunction in the hypothalamus, including in the MC4R pathway, is thought to contribute to hyperphagia and obesity in BBS. BBS is a genetically heterogeneous disease that has been associated with mutations in 29 genes, to date. All result in a similar syndrome of clinical manifestations. Recent scientific studies identify deficiencies affecting the MC4R pathway as a potential cause of the hyperphagia and obesity associated with BBS, and demonstrate that an MC4R agonist can directly impact these symptoms. 
Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial Evaluating Setmelanotide in BBS 
Approvals and marketing authorizations for BBS in the United States, the EU, the United Kingdom, and Canada were based on data from our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of setmelanotide in patients with BBS. As we first reported in December 2020, the trial met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in weight and hunger at 52 weeks on therapy. 
The pivotal data that formed the basis for IMCIVREE’s approvals in BBS were published in the peer-reviewed journal 
The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology 
in November 2022. As previously disclosed, treatment with setmelanotide resulted in significant weight and hunger reductions after one year of treatment among patients with BBS. The primary endpoint was achieved by 32.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 16.7%, 51.4%; p=0.0006) of patients ≥12 years old, all

of whom were patients with BBS. Data highlights among patients with BBS (n=32) after 52 weeks of setmelanotide include:
●
Fifteen (15) patients ≥18 years achieved a mean (SD) percent reduction in BMI of -9.1% (6.8%; 95% CI, −13.4%, −4.8%);
●
Fourteen (14) patients <18 years achieved a mean (SD) change in BMI Z score of −0.8 (0.5; 95% CI, −1.0, −0.5), and 12 patients (85.7%) achieved ≥0.2-point reduction in BMI Z; and
●
Fourteen (14) patients ≥12 years who reported hunger scores achieved reduction of -30.5% in maximal hunger score.
The safety results observed in this study were consistent with that observed with setmelanotide in previous clinical trials in patients with other rare MC4R pathway diseases. Skin hyperpigmentation (n=23; 60.5%) was the most common adverse event (AE). Two patients experienced serious AEs, neither of which was considered related to setmelanotide treatment. 
Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials Evaluating Setmelanotide in Biallelic POMC and LEPR Deficiency Obesities 
We assessed the safety and efficacy of IMCIVREE in two pivotal trials that were identically designed: one-year, open-label studies, each with an eight-week, double-blind withdrawal period. The studies enrolled patients with homozygous or presumed compound heterozygous pathogenic, likely pathogenic variants, or VUS, for either the POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR gene. In both studies, adult patients had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. Weight in pediatric patients was ≥95th percentile using growth chart assessments.
Efficacy analyses were conducted in 21 patients who had completed at least one year of treatment at the time of a pre-specified data cutoff. Of the 21 patients included in the efficacy analysis in both pivotal studies, 62% were adults and 38% were aged 16 years or younger. In Study 1, 50% of patients were female, 70% were White, and the median baseline BMI was 40.0 kg/m
2
 (range: 26.6-53.3). In Study 2, 73% of patients were female, 91% were White, and the median baseline BMI was 46.6 kg/ m
2
 (range: 35.8-64.6).
In the POMC/PCSK1 study, 80% of patients with obesity due to POMC or PCSK1 deficiency met the primary endpoint, achieving a ≥10% weight loss after one year of treatment with IMCIVREE. In the LEPR study, 46% of patients with obesity due to LEPR deficiency met the primary endpoint by achieving a ≥10% weight loss after 1 year of treatment with IMCIVREE.
Phase 3 Trial Results in Patients Between 2 Years Old and Younger than 6 
The hyperphagia and severe obesity of rare, genetically-caused MC4R pathway diseases can present early in life. Therefore, we believe access to treatment earlier in life will lead to better outcomes for children. In 2023, we completed our 52-week, Phase 3 pediatrics trial and demonstrated that setmelanotide met the primary endpoint and achieved clinically meaningful weight reduction in patients within this age range. This trial was a multi-center, one-year, open-label trial in pediatric patients with obesity due to biallelic POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency or a clinical diagnosis of BBS with genetic confirmation. The primary efficacy endpoint was a responder analysis, based on the proportion of patients who experience a decrease from baseline in BMI-Z score of ≥0.2.
These data were published in the peer-reviewed journal 
The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology 
in November 2024: 
●
83 percent of all patients (10 of 12) achieved ≥ 0.2 reduction in BMI-Z score from baseline to week 52; 
●
18 percent mean reduction from baseline in BMI at week 52 (N=12); 
●
3.04 mean reduction from baseline in BMI-Z score at week 52 (N=12); and

●
The safety profile was consistent with past trials evaluating setmelanotide.
Based on these data, IMCIVREE received authorization as the first-ever precision medicine in the EU for control of hunger and treatment of obesity in adults and children as young as 2 years old, living with BBS or POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency on July 31, 2024. The UK’s MHRA also expanded marketing authorization for IMCIVREE to include patients as young as 2 years with BBS or POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency on December 3, 2024. In addition, on December 20, 2024, the FDA also approved an expanded indication for IMCIVREE to include children as young as 2 years old.

Development of Setmelanotide for Additional Indications
Acquired Hypothalamic Obesity
We are on track and plan to read out topline data from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating setmelanotide as a treatment for acquired hypothalamic obesity in the second quarter of 2025. Acquired hypothalamic obesity is characterized by rapid-onset, severe obesity caused by injury to the hypothalamic region which may impair MC4R pathway signaling leading to hyperphagia, decreased energy expenditure, and severe obesity. It occurs most frequently after hypothalamic damage resulting from craniopharyngioma or other intracranial tumor, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or surgical resection or radiation of brain tumors. There are no known approved therapies for this disease.  
In 2022, setmelanotide demonstrated potential to transform the care of individuals living with the rapid onset of extreme weight gain of hypothalamic obesity with clinical data that suggested setmelanotide treatment resulted in significant, durable weight loss. On the basis of these results, we requested, and setmelanotide received, Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of acquired hypothalamic obesity in 2022. 
Lesions of the hypothalamus can derive from various types of tumors (e.g., craniopharyngiomas, gliomas, pituitary adenomas, hamartomas) or may be caused by surgeries and/or radiotherapies for the treatment of these same tumor types. These hypothalamic lesions, whether caused by the tumor itself and/or the treatment of the tumor, can disrupt the MC4R pathway. Moreover, patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity display a high degree of hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia. Alpha-melanocortin stimulating hormone (MSH) can be detectable in blood, and its levels can change depending on different energy states; however, in patients with craniopharyngioma or post-surgical treatment for it, α-MSH levels are significantly reduced. Reduced serum α-MSH levels may suggest melanocortin pathway deficiency, which might explain obesity in these patients.
We completed enrollment in our global Phase 3, 120-patient trial of setmelanotide in acquired hypothalamic obesity with patients aged 4 years or older with hypothalamic obesity randomized 2:1 to setmelanotide therapy or placebo for a total of 60 weeks, including up to eight weeks for dose titration. We enrolled a total of 131 patients in this trial; however, as discussed with both the FDA and the EMA, we expect our planned regulatory submissions will be based on data from the pivotal, 120-patient cohort. The primary endpoint is the percent change in BMI after 52 weeks on a therapeutic regimen of setmelanotide versus placebo. We are on track to report top-line study results in the second quarter of 2025.
On January 10, 2025, we announced that we completed enrollment in a supplemental cohort of 12 Japanese patients, which we added to our global Phase 3 trial in acquired hypothalamic obesity. Based on discussions with Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), we plan to use data from this cohort as part of our planned registration package seeking approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. In addition to efficacy data, we will plan to collect and submit pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Japanese patients in an effort to expedite the typical pathway of collecting such data in an earlier-stage trial in Japanese subjects. Our review of certain tumor registries and claims data in Japan point to a higher per-capita prevalence and incidence rate of this disease than in Europe and the United States. We estimate there are approximately 5,000 to 8,000 patients in Japan with hypothalamic obesity. 
The pivotal Phase 3 trial follows positive efficacy results from our 16-week Phase 2 trial, as well as data demonstrating durable and deepening weight loss in patients who transitioned from the Phase 2 trial to our open-label, long-term extension trial. We enrolled 18 patients in its open-label, 16-week Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate

setmelanotide in acquired hypothalamic obesity in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile (children 6 to <18 years) or ≥35 kg/m
2
 (adults ≥18 years). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a 5% or greater reduction in BMI after 16 weeks of treatment. Hunger was also assessed daily, as self-reported by individual patients. These data were published in the peer-reviewed journal 
The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology
 in April 2024. In this trial, we observed a consistent reduction in body weight and hunger in all adherent patients. Results demonstrated:
●
89% (16 of 18) of patients achieved the primary endpoint;
●
78% (14 of 18) of patients achieved a 10% or greater reduction in BMI at 16 weeks;
●
Mean percent reduction in BMI was 15% from baseline;
●
In pediatric patients (n=13), the mean (standard deviation [SD]) BMI Z score at Week 16 was 2.7 (1.3), a reduction of 1.3 (1.0) points from baseline; and
●
Mean (SD) most hunger score at baseline was 6.6 (1.6), compared with 3.7 (2.5) at Week 16, for a reduction of –2.9 (2.3) points or 45% for patients ≥12 years of age (n=11).
The publication also included preliminary data from our long-term extension of the Phase 2 study that were disclosed at ObesityWeek
®
 2023. These data show patients with hypothalamic obesity (n=12) achieved mean BMI reduction of approximately 26% at one year on setmelanotide treatment. Consistent with prior experience, setmelanotide was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the primary trial included nausea (61.1%), vomiting (33.3%), skin hyperpigmentation (33.3%), diarrhea (22.2%), and COVID-19 (22.2%). Two patients discontinued due to AEs and a third patient was non-compliant. No new safety concerns were observed during the long-term extension trial.
In addition, a poster presentation was delivered at ObesityWeek® in San Antonio, TX, in November 2024, with new, real-world data showing improvements in hunger scores and BMI reductions in adult patients in France with acquired hypothalamic obesity who were treated with setmelanotide. These data were generated from eight patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity age 18 years or older with a previous resection of a tumor in the hypothalamus who were being treated with setmelanotide for three months or longer in five different hospitals in France under pre-marketing early access authorization. We believe these data were particularly encouraging because they suggest that setmelanotide has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in adults with acquired hypothalamic obesity. Mean duration between the time the patients had their tumor resected and setmelanotide treatment began was 12.1 years. Results from the analysis included:
●
Mean BMI reduction from baseline:
o
5.6% (-2.3 kg/m2) after one month of treatment (N=8);
o
12.8% (-5.7 kg/m2) after three months of treatment (N=8); and
o
21.3% (-7.6 kg/m2) after six months of treatment (n=5);
●
At three months of treatment, all patients had achieved a reduction in weight of 5% or more;
●
All eight patients showed a reduction in three or more categories of hunger score (daily average hunger, daily most hunger, daily least hunger, daily morning hunger) from baseline as assessed by questionnaires; and
Congenital hypothalamic obesity 
Congenital hypothalamic obesity is a rare disease caused by certain brain abnormalities that may impair the function of the MC4R pathway, which regulates satiety or food intake and energy expenditure. It is a severe, refractory obesity that is underdiagnosed and not widely understood with high unmet need as there are no approved treatment options.

It is it is often associated with pituitary and hypothalamic dysfunction. Unlike acquired hypothalamic obesity – which is known to be caused by certain brain tumors and their treatment – there is little recognition and or understanding of congenital hypothalamic obesity and its different causes, as the connection between the severe obesity and MC4R pathway in the hypothalamus may not be evident.  
An impairment in the MC4R pathway can lead to reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia and, consequently, severe obesity. Rare diseases that may cause congenital hypothalamic obesity include septo-optic dysplasia (or de Morsier syndrome), optic nerve hypoplasia, multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (also known as combined pituitary hormone deficiency) and pituitary stalk interruption syndrome. Each of these diseases is considered rare and between 12% and 40% of patients with these diseases may have congenital hypothalamic obesity. We estimate the prevalence of congenital hypothalamic obesity to be in excess of 1,000 patients in the United States and in excess of 1,000 patients in Europe. 
U.S. and European experts have highlighted an urgent, unmet medical need for therapeutic options for patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity, as none are approved for this heterogenous patient population. 
On November 19, 2024, we announced a poster presentation delivered during the 62nd annual meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (EPSE) in Liverpool, England, which detailed two case reports from patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity treated with setmelanotide through our pre-approval, early-access program for setmelanotide in France. The poster details included:  
●
Female, age 15, with septo-optic dysplasia as cause of hypothalamic obesity, achieved a body weight decrease of 9.6% from baseline (94 kg) at month 3 and BMI-Z score change from 3.1 at baseline to 2.8; and
●
Male, age 9, with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) as cause of hypothalamic obesity, achieved a body weight decrease of 5.2% from baseline (64 kg) at month 3 and BMI-Z score change from 3.7 at baseline to 3.5. 
Based on these case reports, in the first quarter of 2025 we added a 34-week substudy, which is designed to evaluate setmelanotide in 39 patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity aged 4 years and older as a protocol amendment to our ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating setmelanotide in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. The substudy in congenital hypothalamic obesity is independent from the pivotal Phase 3 trial cohort in acquired hypothalamic obesity. 
Clinical Development to Address Additional MC4R Pathway Diseases
We also are advancing a broad clinical development program evaluating setmelanotide, and we are leveraging the largest known DNA database focused on obesity - with approximately 100,000 sequencing samples as of December 2024 - to improve the understanding, diagnosis and care of people living with hyperphagia and severe obesity due to certain variants in genes associated with the MC4R pathway. There remains a significant unmet need with no effective therapeutic options for patients with these rare MC4R pathway diseases, and we believe setmelanotide has the potential to address the hyperphagia and severe obesity associated with these rare genetic diseases.  
Phase 3 EMANATE Trial
The ongoing pivotal Phase 3 EMANATE clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate setmelanotide therapy over a 52-week period in four independent substudies in patients with obesity due to: a heterozygous variant of the 
POMC/PCSK1
 genes or 
LEPR 
gene and certain variants of the 
SRC1 
gene or the 
SH2B1
 gene. 
POMC, PCSK1 
and
 LEPR
 are core genes of the MC4R pathway. Heterozygous variants in 
POMC
, 
PCSK1
 and 
LEPR
 have been associated with clinical obesity that may be due to MC4R pathway dysfunction. Obesity due to rare variants in the 
SRC1
 gene is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by early-onset severe obesity and hyperphagia, as 
SRC1
 variants found in individuals with severe obesity significantly impaired leptin-induced POMC expression (
Yang et al 2019, Nat Comm. 10, Article 1718
). Specifically, 
SRC1
 is a transcriptional coactivator that has links 
18

Table of Contents
to both the leptin receptor and to POMC. When the leptin receptor is activated, 
SRC1
 is activated through a cascade of events that then drives the expression of POMC. Individuals who have heterozygous loss-of-function variants in their SRC1 genes can have insufficient leptin receptor activation of the MC4R pathway as a result of decreased POMC expression. This decreases the amount of available MSH to activate the MC4R, consequently resulting in hyperphagia and obesity in these individuals. Obesity due to variants in the 
SH2B1
 gene is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by early-onset severe obesity, hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and reduced final height. 
SH2B1
 variants can arise through either DNA variants in the 
SH2B1
 gene or through chromosomal deletions (chromosome 16) that encompass the 
SH2B1
 gene. In both cases, dysfunction/loss of only one copy of the SH2B1 gene is sufficient to give rise to obesity and hyperphagia. The SH2B1 protein has been shown to have direct links to the MC4R-pathway. Specifically, SH2B1 is an adapter protein that amplifies the signal coming through the leptin receptor. In individuals who carry heterozygote loss of function mutations in SH2B1 or a chromosomal deletion that removes the SH2B1 from the chromosome, individuals may have insufficient leptin receptor activity activation of their MC4R pathway. This gives rise to a well-documented form of severe early-onset obesity and hyperphagia.
On January 10, 2025, we announced enrollment completion in this 52-week trial. We consider the two most encouraging substudies to be SH2B1 (n=121) and POMC and/or PCSK1 (n=79). The epidemiology estimates for these two genetic indications suggest that approximately 29,000 U.S. patients with one of these genetic deficiencies have the potential to respond to setmelanotide. The epidemiology for the additional two genetic indications enrolled in this trial, SRC1 (n=73) and LEPR (n=23), suggest as many as 24,000 U.S. patients with one of these genetic deficiencies may have the potential to respond to setmelanotide. However, the vast majority of genetic variants of the 
SRC1
 gene are classified as VUS and mostly benign; similarly, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants of the 
LEPR
 gene are ultra-rare. The trial design with four independent substudies allows for independent data readouts and potential registration for each genetic cohort on its own. As the SRC1 and LEPR substudies are under-enrolled and therefore underpowered, it is likely that we would need to complete additional studies in order to seek regulatory approval for these genetic indications. We believe the SH2B1 and POMC/PCSK1 substudies are sufficiently enrolled and powered to seek registration, pending success. The primary endpoint for each substudy is the difference in mean percent change in BMI from baseline to 52 weeks in setmelanotide arm compared to placebo arm. We anticipate reporting topline data  in the first half of 2026.
Proof of Concept Achieved in Exploratory Phase 2 Basket Study
In January 2021, we announced proof-of-concept data from our exploratory Phase 2 Basket Study in multiple patient cohorts of patients with severe obesity due to a variant in one of the two alleles in the POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes (PPL HET obesity), as well as the SRC1 and SH2B1 genes. We subsequently furnished updated data in multiple presentations at medical meetings throughout 2021. The exploratory Phase 2 Basket Study was an open label study designed to evaluate setmelanotide in patients with obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2
 for patients 16 years of age or older or BMI≥ 95th percentile for age and gender for patients between 6 and 16 years old. Patients were stratified by cohort according to their genetic variant. The primary endpoint of the study was the percent of patients in each subgroup showing at least a 5% loss of body weight over three months (such patients are referred to as clinical responders for this study).
PPL HET Obesity (POMC, LEPR, PCSK1) highlights included:
●
Overall, 12 of 35 patients (34.3%) achieved the primary endpoint. This full analysis includes six patients who withdrew early;
​
●
Mean reduction from baseline in body weight over three months across all 35 patients was -3.7%, which includes both clinical responders and non-responders; and
​
●
Among the 12 patients who achieved the primary endpoint (responder group), the mean reduction from baseline in body weight over three months was -10.1%.
​
In our analyses, we are applying variant classification guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics, or ACMG (as described in Richards, et al., 2015), to patient cohort stratification. Specific variants of the POMC, LEPR, PCSK1, SRC1 or SH2B1 gene may be classified based on published data as being pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign or benign, or classified as a variant of unknown significance or VUS. As genetics of obesity remains an emerging 
19

Table of Contents
field, the vast majority of variants in genes associated with the MC4R pathway are classified as VUS. Our hypothesis was that patients with genetic variants that indicate a higher degree of pathogenicity would be more likely to have impaired pathway signaling and therefore more likely to respond to setmelanotide.
●
Patients with PPL HET obesity were stratified into three pre-specified cohorts by classification of their genetic variants according to ACMG guidelines;
​
●
Four of eight patients (50.0%) with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant achieved greater than 5% weight loss over three months;
​
●
Four of eight patients (50.0%) with the N221D variant of the PCSK1 gene achieved greater than 5% weight loss over three months; and
​
●
Four of 19 patients (21.1%) with a variant of unknown significance (VUS) achieved greater than 5% weight loss over three months.
​
In September 2021, we presented updated interim data from the SRC1 and SH2B1 cohorts at the at the 59
th
 Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting. The data presented were based on an interim analysis of patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy. These presentations included analyses that showed setmelanotide achieved clinically meaningful weight loss or BMI Z reduction in 30% (9 of 30) of study participants with obesity due to variants of the SRC1 gene and clinically meaningful weight loss or BMI Z reduction in 43% (15 of 35) of study participants with obesity due to variants of the SH2B1 gene, including 16p11.2 chromosomal deletions.
Specifically, in the SRC1 cohort, a total of 30 patients with obesity and deficiency in the SRC1 gene were enrolled in the full analysis set of this study. These patients had a mean BMI of 45.4 kg/m

 or BMI Z of 3.0 at baseline. Highlights of these data, as of a cut-off date of March 16, 2021, include:
●
Nine of 30 (or 30%) of patients achieved a clinically meaningful response to setmelanotide at three months, as defined by weight loss of 5% or greater from baseline, or for patients under 18 years old, a reduction of at least 0.15 in BMI Z score:
​
o
In adult patients 18 years or older, six of 20 (or 30%) achieved 5% or greater weight loss at three months;
​
o
In patients younger than 18 years, three of 10 (or 30%) achieved a BMI Z reduction of 0.15% or more at three months.
​
●
Across all enrolled patients, the mean overall weight loss from baseline to three months among patients 18 years and older (a sample of 20) was -4.0% (a standard deviation of 3.3%), and the mean overall BMI Z score reduction from baseline to three months among patients younger than 18 years (n=10) was -0.21 (a standard deviation of 0.23).
In addition, these interim data showed a clear separation between patients who responded to setmelanotide treatment at three months and those who did not:
●
The mean body weight reduction for adult patients who responded (n= 6) was 7.9% (90% confidence interval (CI), −9.7 to −6.0), as compared to 2.3% (90% CI, −3.2 to −1.4) for adult patients who did not respond (a sample of 14);
​
●
The mean BMI Z reduction for patients younger than 18 years who responded (n= 3) was 0.48 (90% CI, −0.95 to −0.01), as compared to 0.09 (90% CI, −0.11 to −0.07) for those who did not respond (n= 7).

In the SH2B1 cohort, a total of 35 patients with obesity and 16p11.2 deletions that include the SH2B1 gene or deficiency in the SH2B1 gene were enrolled in the full analysis set of this study. These patients had a mean BMI of 47.2 kg/m2 or BMI Z of 3.6 at baseline. Highlights of these interim data, as of a cut-off date of March 16, 2021, include:
●
Fifteen of 35 (or 42.9%) of patients achieved a clinically meaningful response to setmelanotide at three months, as defined by weight loss of 5% or greater from baseline, or for patients under 18 years old, a reduction of at least 0.15 in BMI Z score:
​
o
In patients 18 or older, eight of 22 (or 36.4%) achieved 5% or greater weight loss at three months;
o
In patients younger than 18 years, seven of 13 (or 53.8%) achieved a BMI Z reduction of 0.15% or more at three months.
​
Across all enrolled patients, the mean overall weight loss from baseline to three months among patients 18 years and older (n= 22) was -3.1% (a standard deviation of 3.9%), and the mean overall BMI Z score reduction from baseline to three months among patients younger than 18 years (n= 13) was -0.15 (a standard deviation of 0.13). In addition, the interim data showed a clear separation between patients who responded to setmelanotide treatment at three months and those who did not:
●
The mean body weight reduction for adult patients who responded (n= 8) was 7.2% (90% CI, −8.6 to −5.8), as compared to 0.8% (90% CI, −1.9 to 0.3) for adult patients who did not respond (n= 14);
​
●
The mean BMI Z reduction for patients younger than 18 years who responded (n= 7) was 0.25 (90% CI, −0.29 to −0.21), as compared to 0.03 (90% CI, −0.08 to 0.02) patients younger than 18 years who did not respond (n= 7).
Consistent with prior clinical experience, setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in each of these rare genetic diseases of obesity as of the cutoff date. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, included mild injection site reactions, hyperpigmentation, and nausea and vomiting, which occurred early in the treatment course. There were no SAEs related to treatment with setmelanotide. 
Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial 
In 2024, we completed our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial, a signal- finding study with a two-stage design, that successfully identified six cohorts of interest for further study. We believe the DAYBREAK trial was the most comprehensive Phase 2 trial ever initiated in rare MC4R pathway diseases. This trial was designed to evaluate setmelanotide in patients with hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by variants in one of 31 pre-identified genes known to have strong relevance to the MC4R pathway. 
Stage 1 of the trial ruled out several genes for further exploration based on patient prevalence or lack of response. We designed Stage 1 to evaluate setmelanotide in patients who carry a confirmed variant in one or more genes with strong or very strong relevance to the MC4R pathway. This first stage of the study consisted of a 16-week open-label treatment period; patients 18 years or older who achieved a body mass index (BMI) at least 3% less than the Baseline BMI at the end of Stage 1 and patients <18 years old who achieved a BMI at least 3% less than the Baseline BMI or a decrease in BMI Z-score of at least 0.05 at the end of Stage 1 were eligible for enrollment in the second stage of the study. 
A total of 49 patients who completed Stage 1 with a response to setmelanotide (as detailed below) were randomized into Stage 2 of the trial. Stage 2 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study. These patients were stratified into genetically defined cohorts and randomized 2:1 to receive setmelanotide or placebo. After analyzing the results from Stage 2, we deemed the following genes or gene families to merit further study with MC4R agonism: SEMA3 family, PHIP, and TBX3 or PLXNA family.

On November 4, 2024, we presented topline data from the DAYBREAK trial at ObesityWeek
® 
2024 in San Antonio, Texas. Results from Stage 2 showed:
●
A significantly higher proportion of patients in the setmelanotide arm achieved or maintained 5% BMI reduction from baseline through the end of Stage 2 compared with the placebo arm (84.4% vs. 29.4%, p=0.001); a -12.4% mean percent BMI reduction was observed for all patients (n=29) on continuous setmelanotide therapy of 40 weeks;
●
Change in BMI between baseline and the end of stage 2 was variable between gene cohorts, with the most consistent pattern of response seen in patients with PHIP variants. 
●
Other encouraging responses were observed from the SIM1, MAGEL2, PLXNA(1-4), and SEMA3(A-G) genes; and
●
Setmelanotide was well tolerated with no new safety concerns.
During our “Update on MC4R Pathway Program” event on December 6, 2023, we announced data from the Stage 1 open-label part of DAYBREAK, which demonstrated potential efficacy in patients in multiple genetically-defined cohorts. We presented data from the full analysis set for DAYBREAK, which included 164 patients. A total of 112 patients completed the 16-week Stage 1 of the Phase 2 trial, with 52 patients who discontinued. The rates of response from Stage 1 of the trial were: 
●
30% of patients (12 of 40) with variants in the SEMA3 gene cohort;
●
35.6% of patients (16 of 45) with variants in the PLXNAs gene cohort;
●
56.3% of patients (9 of 16) with variants in the PHIP gene cohort;
●
40% of patients (2 of 5) with variants in the TBX3 gene cohort;
●
30% of patients (3 of 10) with variants in the MAGEL2 gene cohort; and
●
25% of patients (5 of 20) with variants in the SIM1 gene cohort. 
​
For those who completed Stage 1, the rates of response of patients who achieved a BMI reduction of greater than 5% from a post-hoc analysis were: 
●
44.4% of patients (12 of 27) with variants in the PLXNs gene cohort;
●
61.5% of patients (16 of 26) with variants in the SEMA3 gene cohort; and
●
69.2% of patients (9 of 13) with variants in the PHIP gene cohort.
​
We believe these data and analyses from DAYBREAK provide valuable insight into the MCR4 pathway, and we will continue our work to better understand which gene variants have loss of function and maybe disease causing as opposed to those variants which are benign. We believe this work will allow us to identify more accurately patients who may respond to MC4R agonism. We may continue clinical development in these genetic indications with bivamelagon and/or RM-718. 
Phase 2 Trial in Prader-Willi Syndrome
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that results in a number of physical, mental and behavioral problems. Key features of PWS include an excess weight gain due to a combination of low resting energy expenditure and a severe, constant hyperphagia with onset in early-mid childhood. There are currently no approved therapies that effectively reduce the extreme hyperphagia or address low resting energy expenditure experienced by patients with PWS, which, if not managed by stringent food restrictions and environmental controls, often results in life-threatening obesity. Approximately 20,000 people in the United States and approximately 400,000 people worldwide are estimated to be living with this disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of PWS.

Table of Contents
While the underlying etiology of the hyperphagia and excess weight gain in PWS is multifactorial, there remains a logical biological justification for MC4R agonism in this patient population. The critical chromosomal region relevant for PWS contains genetic regions that may impact signaling within the MC4R pathway. Notably, deletions in this region have been shown to be associated with decreased expression of PCSK1, which encodes a key prohormone convertase enzyme in the MC4R pathway.  Relevant mouse models recapitulate the hyperphagia phenotype seen in PWS (
Polex-Wolf J et al 2018
). Disruption of MAGEL2 expression, a gene within the PWS region, leads to defective leptin sensing in POMC neurons (
Mercer et al. PLoS Genet. 2013;9:e1003207. 7. Pravdivyi et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2015;24:4276-4283
). Interestingly, there was a potential efficacy signal in some patients with a MAGEL2 variant in our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial (
Ortiz et al 2024
). Finally, patients with PWS may have a reduced response to leptin on POMC neurons and consequently reduced MC4R pathway activity 
(Miller 2020
). We believe setmelanotide, a potent MC4R agonist, has the potential to restore signaling and regulation of hunger, energy expenditure, and weight.
In 2016, we completed a Phase 2 trial that evaluated setmelanotide in patients [N=40] with PWS 16-65 years of age. The study had co-primary endpoints of weight and hyperphagia after 4 weeks of placebo or one of three arms on setmelanotide therapy (0.5mg, 1.5mg or 2.5mg). No statistically significant treatment differences were observed for the co-primary endpoints. The AEs reported in this study were consistent with those reported in other setmelanotide trials. The most common AEs reported thought to be related to setmelanotide were injection site reactions.  
On January 10, 2025, we announced our plan to initiate a new, 26-week, open-label Phase 2 trial evaluating setmelanotide for treatment of PWS. Unlike the design of our earlier trial, this new trial design calls for an increased dose of setmelanotide and longer duration of administration. We plan to enroll up to 20 patients with PWS and obesity aged 6 to 65 years old. Patients will be dose escalated up to 3 mg/day (ages 6 to <12) and up to 5 mg/day as tolerated (ages 12-65) and will receive a daily subcutaneous dose of setmelanotide. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints will assess weight, hyperphagia, behavior and pharmacokinetics. This trial is being conducted at a single site in the United States. 
Weekly Formulation of Setmelanotide
In collaboration with Camurus AB, or Camurus, we have developed a once-weekly, long-acting formulation of setmelanotide using FluidCrystal® technology. When injected subcutaneously, aqueous body fluid may be absorbed by the excipient lipid phase, which may then form a gel-like depot consisting of liquid crystals formed in situ leading to slow diffusion of setmelanotide from the depot. While we believe that this formulation may be more convenient and less burdensome than setmelanotide, which is a once-daily administration, for patients and their families, we have paused development in favor of advancing RM-718. In the event RM-718 shows positive efficacy and safety results, we will discontinue development of the weekly formulation of setmelanotide. Concurrently, we are engaging with applicable regulatory authorities to address the impact of our discontinuing development of the weekly formulation of setmelanotide, which was a component of our pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, in the EU (and the United Kingdom) and in January 2025 we submitted a request to modify the PIP to remove elements related to the weekly formulation and we expect to receive a decision sometine in Q2 2025.  
We have completed one Phase 3 trial evaluating the weekly formulation of setmelanotide in patients with rare MC4R pathway diseases. This weekly switch trial was a randomized, double-blind switch trial in patients with obesity due to biallelic or heterozygous POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency or a clinical diagnosis of BBS with genetic confirmation, who were previously enrolled in our long-term, open-label extension trial. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-weekly setmelanotide and once-daily placebo, or once-daily setmelanotide and once-weekly placebo for 13 weeks. Following the 13-week randomized treatment period, patients crossed over to an open-label, 13-week study in which all patients  received once-weekly setmelanotide. The study was intended to provide detailed pharmacokinetic characterization of the weekly formulation. 
Safety and Tolerability Results
Historically, clinical data with other MC4R therapies suggested that MC4R-mediated side effects may include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, increased erections in males, changes in libido and sexual function in females, and nausea and vomiting. It is noteworthy that the pattern of effects differed among each of the other MC4R therapies, 
23

Table of Contents
underscoring the complex physiology of MC4R. With setmelanotide, there has been little, if any, evidence of blood pressure or heart rate changes, preliminarily supporting an important differentiation of setmelanotide from previous MC4R therapies. Monitoring for blood pressure and heart rate changes, as well as other potential adverse events, or AEs, is included in all setmelanotide clinical trials.
Because of these first generation MC4R therapy failures, the setmelanotide program employed an intensive preclinical screening program to assess clinical candidates for blood pressure and heart rate effects, along with efficacy. The cornerstone of this preclinical screening program was a significant investment in obese primate studies which validated setmelanotide as a promising compound for clinical development. Research supporting a unique mechanism of action of setmelanotide, compared to earlier MC4R agonists and the endogenous ligand MSH, was published in May 2018 in Nature Medicine.
Setmelanotide was generally well-tolerated in our Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials to date. Overall, except as outlined below, the number and patterns of AEs were generally low, and the intensity of the AEs was generally mild, and only infrequently led to clinical trial discontinuation.
Over the course of our clinical development program, a total of 926 patients who participated in our trials have received the daily or weekly formulation of setmelanotide, including 24 patients who had been on setmelanotide therapy for more than five years, as of November 24, 2024 (excluding commercial therapy):

In the majority of our trials, we observed a small increase in frequency of penile erections in male patients, as well as signs of sexual arousal in a small number of female patients. These symptoms were infrequent, generally mild, not painful, and short-lived. Most often these symptoms were reported in the first week of treatment. There was a small incidence of nausea and vomiting, as well as injection site reactions, both of which usually were reported as mild, early in treatment, and short-lived. A small number of patients had dose reductions and/or discontinued treatment due to nausea and vomiting.
We also noted darkening of skin and skin lesions, such as moles and freckles, in approximately half of the patients who received setmelanotide. This was likely caused by activation of the closely related MC1 receptor, the receptor that mediates skin darkening in response to sun exposure. This was observed generally after one to two weeks of treatment, most often plateaued by two to four weeks of treatment, and like sun-related tanning, generally returned to baseline after cessation of exposure.

Overall, the most common AEs reported among setmelanotide treated patients in our clinical trials have been skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite.
Life Cycle Management and Pipeline Expansion
In 2024, we made significant strides in our development of two new clinical programs designed to expand our MC4R agonist product portfolio. RM-718 and bivamelagon are being evaluated in hypothalamic obesity in Phase 1 and 2 trials, respectively. In addition, we are advancing potential candidates for CHI, a rare genetic disease.
Bivamelagon, an oral MC4R agonist 
On January 4, 2024, we announced that we entered into a global licensing agreement with LG Chem, Ltd., or LGC, a leading global company headquartered in South Korea that specializes in life sciences as one of its core businesses, for bivamelagon, an investigational oral small molecule MC4R agonist now in a Phase 2 clinical trial. The development of an effective oral therapy for treating MC4R pathway diseases has been a major goal for the industry and we believe the early data from LGC suggests bivamelagon has the potential to address MC4R pathway diseases without hyperpigmentation or cardiovascular side effects. We believe our deep developmental experience and global commercial presence uniquely position us to develop this molecule with the goal of offering a portfolio of treatment options to patients struggling with hyperphagia and severe obesity enabling the treatment that is right for them. 
In a Phase 1 trial in healthy overweight adults, bivamelagon demonstrated dose-dependent weight reduction. Bivamelagon also demonstrated favorable safety results in the trial, with no changes in blood pressure or heart rate observed and no hyperpigmentation observed. In addition, bivamelagon has received orphan drug designation from FDA for the treatment of LEPR deficiency.
We completed enrollment in our Phase 2 trial evaluating bivamelagon in acquired hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025. The Phase 2 trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the effect of bivamelagon on safety, weight reduction, hunger, and quality of life measures in patients 12 years of age and older (N=28) with acquired hypothalamic obesity. Patients will take an oral daily dose of either bivamelagon (low, middle, or high dose) or placebo for 14 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in body mass index after 14 weeks of treatment, and patients may continue on therapy for up to 52 weeks.
RM-718, a next generation MC4R peptide agonist  
Our MC4R peptide agonist for weekly administration, the new chemical entity, RM-718, has demonstrated the potential to reduce body weight and hunger, with favorable safety results observed in preclinical studies. RM-718 is designed to be more highly targeted and MC1R sparing with the potential to not cause hyperpigmentation. In a series of pre-clinical studies, RM-718 reduced overall body weight, body weight gain and food consumption in animal models. We initiated a Phase 1 in-human trial in the first quarter of 2024, including a multiple-ascending dose study in patients with hypothalamic obesity. 
RM-718 is an investigational, synthetic, cyclic heptamer (7-amino acid-containing) peptide, and is designed as a selective and potent MC4R agonist that spares other melanocortin receptors. The RM-718 formulation is a sustained release depot designed for once weekly (QW), subcutaneous (SC) injection, consisting of RM-718 and excipients. The major components are phospholipids (PL) that are a natural part of the cell membrane and, once injected into tissue and coming into contact with aqueous body fluids and tissues, can precipitate and trap a co-administered drug to form a drug-PL co-precipitate (nanometer-sized phospholipid particles) that functions as a depot. Over time, this depot slowly diffuses into the surrounding tissue and/or is degraded by local phospholipase (slowly hydrolyzing phospholipids) resulting in a slow and controlled release of RM-718 over time.
On March 25, 2024, we announced that the first participants had been dosed in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RM-718. This Phase 1 trial is a three-part study to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK. The study consists of Part A: single ascending doses (SAD) of RM-718 in healthy participants 18 to 55 years old with obesity; Part B: multiple ascending doses (MAD) of RM-718 in healthy participants 18 to 55 years old with obesity; and Part C: MAD of RM-718 in patients 
25

12 to 65 years old with hypothalamic obesity. Cohorts in Parts A and B are double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized 2:1. Study participants will receive one weekly dose of either RM-718 or placebo in Part A, four weekly doses of either RM-718 or placebo in Part B, and 16 weekly doses of open-label RM-718 in Part C. In all Parts, RM-718 or placebo doses are administered weekly via subcutaneous injection. 
We completed a protocol amendment in December 2024 and we expect to begin enrolling patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity in Part C of the Phase 1 trial evaluating RM-718 in the first quarter of 2025. We plan to enroll up to 30 patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity for 16 weeks in Part C of this Phase 1 trial, and patients may continue on therapy for up to 52 weeks. The anticipated total enrollment for all of Parts A, B and C of this study is up to 120 participants.
Nonclinical studies of RM-718 in obese rats over 3 weeks of treatment demonstrated significant and stable reduction of body weight (-12.9 %) and body weight gain, reduced food, and water consumption (~ -25%) and improvement in insulin sensitivity without any pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Studies in rodents (diet induced obese rats and mice including obese Zucker rats and Sprague Dawley rats) also demonstrated that RM-718 suppressed food intake and weight gain. 
Nonclinical toxicology studies of RM-718 administered for 28 days were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with doses up to 30 mg/kg. RM-718 was well tolerated in rats and monkeys, with no evidence of systemic toxicity. RM-718-related clinical observations of hyperpigmentation of skin on the muzzle in monkeys were rare (observed in only one monkey at the 30 mg/kg dose). Microscopic analysis showed minimal to moderate increased pigment of the epidermis of the skin of the muzzle at ≥10 mg/kg/doses, and we believe this result is probably species-specific and the result of MC1R stimulation. Chronic toxicology studies in non-human primates (NHP) and rats (39 and 26 weeks, respectively) have recently completed and we believe support long-term dosing in patients.
In safety pharmacology studies evaluating potential adverse effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in cynomolgus monkeys, RM-718 produced no treatment-related changes in effects on heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiographic changes, or respiratory parameters up to the 30 mg/kg weekly dose. Moreover, the MC4R peptide agonist LY2112688 (formulated by Eli Lilly and Company), continuous SC infusion for 3 days of LY2112688 at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day, resulted in a slight increase in blood pressure at the 1 mg/kg/day dose level, relative to the reference item (saline), with effects being more pronounced during the night cycle, with no definitive effect on heart rate. These changes were not noted following continuous administration of RM-718 at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg/day for 3 days, with heart rate and blood pressure remaining comparable to the reference item (saline) up to 96 hours post start of infusion. A slight, non-dose dependent decrease in body temperature was seen in all test article-treated groups over the course of the study, all within normal variation for monkeys and it was not considered adverse. 
Congenital Hyperinsulinism Program 
In February 2023, we completed the acquisition of Xinvento B.V., or Xinvento, a Dutch private limited liability company based in the Netherlands, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Netherlands B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company. Xinvento was founded in 2021 by Claudine van der Sande to identify and develop novel investigational therapeutic candidates designed to improve the care of patients and families living with CHI.  Ms. Van der Sande joined Rhythm as a vice president and head of our CHI program following the acquisition.  
CHI is a rare disease that we believe is well aligned with our corporate strategy and broadens our focus into an adjacent endocrine indication with a high unmet need. CHI is the most frequent cause of severe, random and persistent hypoglycemia in newborns and children. Hypoglycemia results from an over-secretion of insulin, which causes blood sugar levels to fall dangerously low. Without proper and immediate treatment, patients with CHI may suffer seizures, coma, or even death and, longer term, children may experience developmental delays, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and other neurological damage. Available treatments are suboptimal in terms of safety, tolerability and effectiveness. Patient and family surveys conducted by Congenital Hyperinsulinism International, a global patient advocacy organization, demonstrate that hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) levels are occurring one or more times per day in 48% of patients, and up to once a week in an additional 20% of patients, in each case, despite being on standard of care. In the United States, the estimated incidence rate for CHI is 1:29,000 to 1:31,000, according to the literature. With the acquisition, Rhythm acquired a suite of assets designed to treat patients with this disease. In our CHI Program, we are focused on identifying

and nominating a development candidate to advance into IND-enabling studies. We anticipate nominating a product candidate in 2025.
Genetic Sequencing and Patient Finding
We continue to expand our sequencing efforts in individuals living with early-onset, severe obesity to support research, patient finding and community building efforts to better understand rare MC4R pathway diseases. Our obesity DNA database contains sequencing data from approximately 100,000 individuals, as of December 31, 2024. Our sequencing data has come from four distinct sources in recent years: the Genetic Obesity ID | Genotyping Study, a global network of collaborations with obesity researchers with individual sample collections, institutional biobanks and Uncovering Rare Obesity (URO) or Rare Obesity Advanced Diagnosis (ROAD) programs.
More than 90% of our DNA sequencing database is derived from the U.S. population. Therefore, our estimates of patient populations in Canada and Europe are more preliminary, but we believe the prevalence of these genetic diseases in Canada and Europe are similar to those in United States. By bringing additional awareness to these rare genetic diseases of obesity, our sequencing efforts have the potential to help foster patient communities and drive medical action in these populations.
URO, our sponsored genetic testing program designed to increase access to genetic testing and help determine if individuals have an underlying genetic cause of their severe obesity, is the primary driver of how we collect sequencing samples and identify patients in the North America region. As obesity has reached epidemic levels in the United States, we are focused on identifying people with early-onset obesity that may be caused by certain rare genetic variants. 
This program complements several initiatives designed to advance the understanding of genetic causes of severe obesity, and URO broadens these efforts and brings access to genetic testing into the community setting. Currently available physician-ordered genetic testing panels are often cost prohibitive, while many consumer genetic tests are incomplete when it comes to genetic disorders of obesity. This makes it difficult to confirm an underlying genetic cause of severe obesity. We believe the program marks an important step in the understanding of these disorders that might help patients and their families find new diagnosis and treatment strategies in the years ahead.
Our U.S. partner, Prevention Genetics, a subsidiary of Exact Sciences Corp., a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-College of American Pathologists of CLIA/CAP-certified independent laboratory, conducts the genetic testing for URO. This program covers the cost of the test and excludes office visit, copay, sample collection, and any other related costs to a participant. In addition, as part of the program, licensed genetic counselors from PWN Health, a leading provider of professional guidance for diagnostic and genetic testing, are available to advise participating individuals.
The ROAD program outside the United States mirrors the URO program as it is designed to increase awareness of rare MC4R pathway diseases caused by genetic variants and support patient identification in the International region. We collect samples from individuals with severe obesity from seven countries, including Spain, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Turkey and Germany. Our partner CGC Genetics Unilabs conducts the genetic testing for ROAD. This program covers the cost of the test, the kit and shipment.
As of the end of 2024, we have collected samples from approximately 100,000 individuals with severe obesity, primarily through our URO and ROAD programs, which now are our primary source of sequencing samples.
Commercial Efforts for IMCIVREE
We are focused on developing our global commercial infrastructure to make IMCIVREE available in as many markets as possible.
IMCIVREE, an MC4R agonist for which we hold worldwide rights, is the first-ever precision medicine developed for patients with certain rare MC4R-pathway diseases approved or authorized in the United States, the EU, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries and regions. IMCIVREE is approved by the FDA to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with syndromic or monogenic

 genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or VUS. The EC and the MHRA have authorized IMCIVREE for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 2 years of age and above.  
We have achieved market access for IMCIVREE for BBS or POMC and LEPR deficiencies, or both, in more than 15 countries outside the United States, and we continue to collaborate with authorities to achieve access in additional markets. 
While we are focused on commercial access for IMCIVREE for BBS and POMC and LEPR deficiencies, we are working with the broader community of patients and families, physicians, scientists and more to engage with them on the impact of hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by rare MC4R pathway diseases. Individually, populations with each of these MC4R pathway diseases are rare, and affected patients face many of the same challenges as any classically rare disease patient populations. There is little or no awareness about rare MC4R pathway diseases, and the patients suffering from them are lost in the health care system, with limited educational resources and no effective treatments for their condition. All our efforts and services described above are designed to address the challenges of rare diseases and lay the groundwork for potential future launches, with a focus on scalability.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors with general obesity medications in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop compounds that could make setmelanotide obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to setmelanotide. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
Currently, IMCIVREE is the only approved treatment for weight management in patients with obesity due to BBS or POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiencies, and there are no other approved treatments for addressing hyperphagia related behaviors of patients with rare MC4R pathway diseases. Metabolic and bariatric surgery may be less effective at achieving long-term weight loss in patients with MC4R pathway diseases given that hyperphagia increases risk of weight regain. Also, existing therapies indicated for general obesity and those in clinical development for the same, such as incretin therapies that target the receptors for the hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-stimulated insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), do not specifically target or restore function impaired by genetic deficiencies and trauma to the hypothalamus that disrupt MC4R pathway signaling, which we believe is a root cause of hyperphagia and obesity in patients with these diseases. Studies such as the SURMOUNT 1 study, which served as the basis of the FDA approval of tirzepitide for obesity, specifically excluded patients with: “obesity induced by other endocrinologic disorders or monogenetic or syndromic forms of obesity.” In addition, several companies report having early-stage programs that are exploring MC4R agonisms.
Licensing Agreements
Ipsen Pharma S.A.S.
Pursuant to our March 21, 2013 license agreement with Ipsen Pharma S.A.S., or Ipsen, we have an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to research, develop, and commercialize compounds that were discovered or researched by Ipsen in the course of conducting its MC4R program or that otherwise were covered by the licensed patents. Rights under the license included the right to research, develop and commercialize setmelanotide. Pursuant to the license, we have a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain

patents and other intellectual property rights that were licensed by Ipsen from a third-party or that Ipsen may develop in the future to research, develop, and commercialize any of the compounds exclusively licensed by Ipsen pursuant to the license.
Under the terms of the Ipsen license agreement, Ipsen is eligible to receive payments of up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of applicable licensed products, and royalties on future sales of the licensed products. Substantially, all of the aggregate payments under the Ipsen license agreement are for milestones that may be achieved no earlier than first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, and as of December 31, 2024, we have paid $4.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestones and $9.0 million in commercial milestones. Royalties in the mid-single digits on future sales of the applicable licensed products will be due under the Ipsen license agreement on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the date when sales of a licensed product in a particular country are no longer covered by patent rights licensed pursuant to the Ipsen license agreement and the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country. The term of the Ipsen license agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. Upon expiration of the term of the agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under the agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid-up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate the license agreement at any time during the term for any reason on 180 days’ written notice to Ipsen. Ipsen has a right to terminate the agreement prior to expiration of its term for our material breach of the agreement, our failure to initiate or complete development of a licensed product or our bringing an action seeking to have an Ipsen license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of the license agreement not due to Ipsen’s material breach, all licensed rights granted under the license agreement will terminate.
Camurus
In January 2016, we entered into a license agreement for the use of Camurus’ drug delivery technology, FluidCrystal®, to formulate setmelanotide in collaboration with Camurus. Under the terms of the agreement, Camurus granted us a worldwide license to the FluidCrystal® technology to formulate setmelanotide and to develop, manufacture, and commercialize this new formulation for once-weekly dosing, administered as a subcutaneous injection. The license granted to us is specific to the FluidCrystal® technology incorporating setmelanotide. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing, development, and commercialization of the setmelanotide FluidCrystal® formulation worldwide. Camurus received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payment of $0.5 million in January 2016, and is eligible to receive progressive payments of approximately $65.0 million, of which the majority are sales milestones. As of December 31, 2024, we have made $2.3 million of milestone payments to Camurus. In addition, Camurus is eligible to receive tiered, mid to mid-high, single-digit royalties on future sales of the product.
The term of the agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. Upon expiration of the term of the agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under the agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid-up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate the license agreement at any time during the term for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to Camurus. Camurus has a right to terminate the agreement prior to expiration of its term for our material breach of the agreement, if we voluntarily or involuntarily file for bankruptcy, or for our bringing an action seeking to have a Camurus license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of the license agreement not due to Camurus’ material breach, all licensed rights granted under the license agreement will terminate.
RareStone Group Ltd.
In December 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with RareStone, or the RareStone License. Pursuant to the RareStone License, we granted to RareStone an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit any pharmaceutical product that contains setmelanotide in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of conditions and diseases in humans in China, including mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. RareStone has a right of first negotiation in the event that Rhythm chooses to grant a license to develop or commercialize the licensed product in Taiwan.

According to the terms of the
 RareStone License
, RareStone has agreed to seek local approvals to commercialize IMCIVREE for the treatment of obesity and hyperphagia due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency, as well as Bardet-Biedl and Alström syndromes. Additionally, RareStone agreed to fund efforts to identify and enroll patients from China in Rhythm’s global EMANATE trial, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate setmelanotide in four independent sub-studies in patients with obesity due to a heterozygous variant of POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR; certain variants of the SRC1 gene, and certain variants of the SH2B1 gene. According to the terms of the
 RareStone License
, RareStone made an upfront payment to Rhythm of $7.0 million and issued Rhythm 1,077,586 ordinary shares. Rhythm will be eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones of up to $62.5 million, as well as tiered royalty payments on annual net sales of IMCIVREE.
On October 28, 2022, we delivered written notice, or the October 2022 Notice, to RareStone that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause.  In accordance with the October 2022 Notice, we maintain that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License to fund, perform or seek certain key clinical studies and waivers, including with respect to our global EMANATE trial, among other obligations. On December 21, 2022, RareStone provided written notice to us that it objects to the claims in the October 2022 Notice, including our termination of the RareStone License for cause. On March 16, 2023, we provided written notice, or the March 2023 Notice, to RareStone reaffirming our position that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License and that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause, and also requested documentation supporting RareStone’s purported dispute notice objecting to the claims in the October 2022 Notice.  On May 10, 2023, RareStone provided written notice to us reaffirming its objections to the claims in our October 2022 Notice and March 2023 Notice, including to our termination of the RareStone License for cause.  On November 29, 2023, RareStone wrote to us seeking to negotiate and execute a commercial supply agreement as contemplated under the Exclusive License Agreement, and on January 19, 2024, we responded in writing again reaffirming our position that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License and that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause.  Since our last written response in January 2024, we have engaged in discussions with RareStone in an effort to reach a resolution, however, we cannot predict whether a resolution will ever be reached.
​
LG Chem 
In January 2024, we entered into a license agreement and share issuance agreement with LG Chem, Ltd, or LGC. Under the terms of the license agreement, we obtained worldwide rights to exploit LGC’s proprietary compound bivamelagon  and have assumed sponsorship of two ongoing LGC Phase 2 studies designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of bivamelagon. The SIGNAL trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed to enroll and evaluate approximately 28 patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. Participants will receive one of three doses of bivamelagon by oral administration once daily for up to 52 weeks, and the primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in body mass index after 14 weeks of treatment. The open-label, single-arm, 16-week ROUTE trial is designed to enroll five patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency obesity. 
​
We paid LGC $40.0 million in cash and issued shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $20.0 million. The shares were issued at a per share price equal to the ten-day volume weighted-average closing price for our common stock, calculated as of the trading day immediately prior to January 4, 2024. We also agreed to make a $40.0 million payment in cash 18 months after the effective date of the license agreement. 
​
In addition and subject to, among other conditions, the completion of Phase 2 development of bivamelagon, we have agreed to pay LGC royalties of between low-to-mid single digit percent of net revenues from products covered by our patent portfolio directed toward the MC4R agonists, including setmelanotide, RM-718, and bivamelagon (collectively, our “MC4R portfolio”), including bivamelagon, commencing in 2029 and also dependent upon achievement of various regulatory and indication approvals, and subject to customary deductions and anti-stacking provisions. Royalties may further increase to a low, double-digit percent royalty, though such royalty would only be applicable on net sales of bivamelagon in a region if bivamelagon is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent controlled by LGC in such region and our MC4R portfolio is not covered by any composition of matter or 
30

method of use patents controlled by us in such region. Such increased rate would only apply on net sales of bivamelagon for the limited remainder of the royalty term in the relevant region.
​
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our MC4R portfolio of licensed and exclusively owned patent families, which includes setmelanotide, RM-718, and bivamelagon, consists of 45 patent families currently being prosecuted or maintained, which include applications and patents directed to compositions of matter, formulations, and methods of making, and methods of treatment. These patent families have been filed in over 40 jurisdictions, including all major markets such as the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan,  Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and Singapore. In the key patent families directed to selected peptide-based MC4R receptor agonists, including the composition of matter for setmelanotide, we have 10 issued United States patents and over 225 issued non-United States patents in various jurisdictions. Patents issuing in these patent families will have a standard 20-year term and expire between 2026 and 2045, in each instance provided that all appropriate maintenance fees are paid and not including any patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or supplementary protection certificates that may be available on a country-by-country basis. For example, in a key patent family providing composition of matter coverage for setmelanotide, we have received 5 years of patent term extension in the United States, extending patent protection in that patent family through 2032. 
In addition to the patents and patent applications discussed above, we co-own one patent family with the University of Strasbourg and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, which is directed to specific uses of MC4R agonists. We also own three patent families directed to small molecule compounds for use in our CHI program, with patent claims that will expire when issued between 2043 and 2045, without factoring in any available patent term extension.
Intellectual Property Protection Strategy
We currently seek, and intend to continue seeking, patent protection whenever commercially reasonable for any patentable aspects of setmelanotide and related technology or any new products or product candidates we acquire in the future. Where our intellectual property is not protected by patents, we may seek to protect it through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information. Our license from Ipsen for the melanocortin program requires Ipsen, subject to certain exceptions and upon consultation with us, to prosecute and maintain its patent rights as they relate to the licensed compounds and methods. If Ipsen decides to cease prosecution or maintenance of any of the licensed patent rights, we have the option to take over prosecution and maintenance of those patents and Ipsen will assign to us all of its rights in such patents. For those patent rights that we own exclusively, we control all prosecution and maintenance activities.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether the product candidate we in-license will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction, and furthermore, we cannot determine whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection to protect us from competitors, or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. This potential issue is exacerbated by the fact that, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention may be entitled to the patent. On March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “first to file” system in which the first inventor to file a patent application may be entitled to the patent. For applications filed prior to the institution of the “first to file” system, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention. Moreover, we may have to participate in other proceedings declared by the United States PTO or a foreign patent office, such as post-grant proceedings and oppositions, that challenge the validity of a granted patent. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.

Although we currently have issued patents directed to a number of different attributes of our products, and pending applications on others, there can be no assurance that any issued patents would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing our patents.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States PTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent with an earlier expiration date.
As mentioned above, in the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. IMCIVREE has received FDA approval and we have been awarded patent term extension on that product. In the future, if and when our other pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term adjustments and extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such adjustments or extensions.
To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts, or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot be certain that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. Any such decision could result in our key technologies not being protectable, allowing third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies from third parties to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or could cause us to lose our rights under existing issued patents or not to have rights granted under our pending patent applications.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, no assurances can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the confidentiality agreements further provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Manufacturing
We currently contract with various third parties for the manufacture of setmelanotide and intend to continue to do so in the future. We have entered into process development and manufacturing service agreements with our CMOs, Corden Pharma Brussels S.A, or Corden (formerly Peptisyntha SA prior to its acquisition by Corden), PolyPeptide Group, Braine L’Alleud, or Polypeptide, Neuland Laboratories, and Recipharm Monts S.A.S for certain process development and manufacturing services for regulatory starting materials and/or drug substance, or API, and drug product in connection with the manufacture of setmelanotide.  We have also entered into commercial supply agreements with both Polypeptide and Recipharm. Under our agreements, we pay these third parties for services and/or manufacture of setmelanotide in 
32

Table of Contents
accordance with the terms of mutually agreed upon work orders, which we may enter into from time to time. We may need to engage additional third-party suppliers to manufacture our clinical and commercial drug supplies in the future. In connection with our commercialization of setmelanotide or any future product candidate, we have engaged and could need to engage other third parties to assist in manufacturing and/or supply chain related aspects. While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and API in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our product, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of continuing to expand capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. Under the current agreements, each party is subject to customary indemnification provisions.
Our contract manufacturing agreements give us visibility into the expected future cost of producing setmelanotide at commercial scale. Based upon a range of prices of currently-marketed therapies indicated for orphan diseases, we believe that our cost of goods for setmelanotide will be highly competitive.
We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work may need to increase scale of production or we expect that we may need to secure additional capacity or seek alternate suppliers. We believe that our current suppliers and CMOs are able to scale production to meet our clinical and commercial demands. Because we rely on these CMOs, we have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for maintaining our CMO relationships.
Setmelanotide is distributed in the United States through our specialty pharmacy and in the EU/UK through third-party service providers that deliver the medication to patients. We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which setmelanotide is approved.
Regulatory Matters
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process or by comparable foreign regulatory authorities through similar applications before it may be legally marketed in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate 
33

Table of Contents
federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
●
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, certain of which must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
●
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
●
approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
●
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
●
preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
●
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review
●
satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
●
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and potential inspection of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
●
FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for allowance from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and 
in vitro
 studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30- day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA allowance to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which among other things, include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing 
34

Table of Contents
suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
●
Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
●
Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
●
Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, including results from preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the 
35

Table of Contents
product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post- market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the 
36

Table of Contents
claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. An NDA for a Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date.
Additionally, depending on the design of the applicable clinical trials, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, and may require that such confirmatory studies be underway prior to granting any accelerated approval. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
37

Table of Contents
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-approval Requirements
Drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition 
38

Table of Contents
of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
●
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
●
fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
●
clinical holds on clinical studies;
●
refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
●
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
●
consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
●
mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
●
the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
●
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of non-patent exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, including, for example, new indications or 
39

Table of Contents
dosages , of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to existing periods of regulatory exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request from the FDA does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an 
in vitro
 diagnostic medical device, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as an 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic device, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic devices. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, an 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.
If the FDA determines that an 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population.
Under the FDCA, 
in vitro
 diagnostics, including 
in vitro
 companion diagnostic devices, are generally regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
After an 
in vitro
 device is authorized by the FDA and placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which currently covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Manufacturing sites for devices also remain subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products are comprised of components, such as drug components and device components, that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established the Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is 
40

Table of Contents
also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. A combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug component generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for such a product, however, FDA reviewers would consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the QSR applicable to medical devices.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of setmelanotide to the extent we choose to sell any setmelanotide outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by equivalent competent authorities in foreign jurisdictions before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, pharmacovigilance, promotion, advertising or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Regulation and Procedures Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products in the European Union
Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical (pharmaco-toxicological) studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC (unless otherwise justified for certain particular medicinal products, e.g., radio-pharmaceutical precursors for radio-labeling purposes) . In particular, non-clinical studies, both 
in vitro
 and 
in vivo
, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines on good clinical practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the EU Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (CTA) to be submitted in each member state in which the clinical trial takes place, to both the competent national health authority and an independent 
41

Table of Contents
ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application for multi-center trials. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR transition period ended on January 31, 2025, and all clinical trials (and related applications) are now fully subject to the provisions of the CTR.  
Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
Marketing Authorizations
In the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit an MA application, (MAA). The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
There are two types of MAs:
●
“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission (EC) through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines, and (iv) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for any products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which the granting of a MA would be in the interest of public health in the EU.
●
“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
A MA has an initial validity for five years in principle. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU member state. To this end, the MA holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the MA was granted, at least six months before the MA ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU member states may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year period of MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market or on the market of the authorizing EU member state(s) within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called “sunset clause”).
42

Table of Contents
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved for medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
Data and marketing exclusivity
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, reference product candidates generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents applicants generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the market exclusivity period, an application for a generic or biosimilar MA can be submitted and a related MA may be granted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar can be placed on the EU market until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Orphan Medicinal Products
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or 
43

Table of Contents
treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from the orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of the application for MA. Orphan designation entitles a party to incentives such fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-years period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that the competent authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant a MA, or accept an application to extend a MA for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP). No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The orphan exclusivity period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for which it received orphan destination, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity, or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Granting of an authorization for another similar orphan medicinal product where another product has market exclusivity can happen at any time if: (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior, (ii) inability of the applicant to supply sufficient quantities of the orphan medicinal product or (iii) where the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the orphan register.
Pediatric Development
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a PIP agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan pharmaceutical products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
Post-Approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance (QPPV) who is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of that system, and oversees the safety profiles of medicinal products and any emerging safety concerns. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
All new MAA must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
44

Table of Contents
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties. 
Regulation of Combination Products in the European Union
The EU regulates medical devices and medicinal products separately, through different legislative instruments, and the applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. EU guidance has been published to help manufacturers select the right regulatory framework. 
Drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the medicinal product and the device form a single integral product are regulated as medicinal products in the EU. The EMA is responsible for evaluating the quality, safety and efficacy of MAAs submitted through the centralized procedure, including the safety and performance of the medical device in relation to its use with the medicinal product. The EMA or the EU member state national competent authority will assess the product in accordance with the rules for medicinal products described above but the device part must comply with the EU Medical Devices Regulation (including the general safety and performance requirements provided in Annex I). MAA must include – where available – the results of the assessment of the conformity of the device part with the EU Medical Devices Regulation contained in the manufacturer’s EU declaration of conformity of the device or the relevant certificate issued by a notified body. If the MAA does not include the results of the conformity assessment and where for the conformity assessment of the device, if used separately, the involvement of a notified body is required, the competent authority must require the applicant to provide a notified body opinion on the conformity of the device. 
By contrast, in case of drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the device and the medicinal product do not form a single integral product (but are e.g. co-packaged), the medicinal product is regulated in accordance with the rules for medicinal products described above while the device part is regulated as a medical device and will have to comply with all the requirements set forth by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. The characteristics of non-integral devices used for the administration of medicinal products may impact the quality, safety and efficacy profile of the medicinal products. To the extent that administration devices are co-packaged with the medicinal product or, in exceptional cases, where the use of a specific type of administration device is specifically provided for in the product information of the medicinal product, additional information may need to be provided in the MAA for the medicinal product on the characteristics of the medical device(s) that may impact on the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the medicinal product. 
The requirements regarding quality documentation for medicinal products when used with a medical device, including single integral products, co-packaged and referenced products, are outlined in the EMA guideline of July 22, 2021, which became effective on January 1, 2022. 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.

Regulation of Companion Diagnostics in the European Union
In the EU, in vitro diagnostic medical devices were regulated by Directive 98/79/EC (IVDD) which regulated the placing on the market, the CE marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufactures and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices had to comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be).
The regulation of companion diagnostics is subject to further requirements since the in vitro diagnostic medical devices Regulation No 2017/746 (IVDR) became applicable on May 26, 2022. Following subsequent legislative changes, European institutions adopted a “progressive” roll-out of the IVDR to prevent disruption in the supply of in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The IVDR fully applies since May 26, 2022 but there is a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the IVDR.
The IVDR introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue an EU certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a MAA for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authority or the EMA.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom (UK) left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.
EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”, however new EU legislation such as the EU CTR or in relation to orphan medicines is not be applicable. The UK government has passed the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain (GB); broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. On February 27, 2023, the UK Government and the European Commission reached a political agreement on the “Windsor Framework” which will revise the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in order to address some of the perceived shortcomings in its operation. Under the changes, Northern Ireland will be reintegrated under the regulatory authority of the MHRA with respect to medicinal products. The Windsor Framework was approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee on March 24, 2023, so the UK government and the EU will enact legislative measures to bring it into law. On June 9, 2023, the MHRA announced that the medicines aspects of the Windsor Framework will apply from January 1, 2025.

The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. After Brexit, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain an MA to commercialize products in the UK. A new international recognition framework has been in place from January 1, 2024, whereby the MHRA will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the EMA and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new GB MA.
There will be no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.
Additionally, on June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. In this response the MHRA confirmed that it would bring forward legislative changes to the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive and the (EU) IVDD), in particular to create new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but have recently been postponed to July 2025. Devices bearing CE marks issued by EU notified bodies under the EU Medical Devices Regulation or EU Medical Devices Directive are now subject to transitional arrangements. The UK Government has introduced legislation that provides that CE-marked medical devices may be placed on the GB market on the following timelines:
●
general medical devices compliant with the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a valid declaration and CE marking can be placed on the GB market up until the sooner of expiry of the certificate or June 30, 2028; and
●
general medical devices, including custom-made devices, compliant with the EU Medical Devices Regulation can be placed on the GB market up until June 30, 2030.
Following these transitional periods, it is expected that all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in GB.
Pharmaceutical Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on Government and third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use IMCIVREE unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement for, IMCIVREE and other product candidates we may develop and obtain approval for in the future. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit 
47

Table of Contents
coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, setmelanotide may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover IMCIVREE or any of our product candidates, if approved, could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for setmelanotide will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of setmelanotide or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.  We are also enrolled in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs, and have price reporting and payment obligations under these programs.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from one member state to another. Some member states may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies or so called Health Technology Assessments (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and particularly in relation to prescription only medicinal products, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
HTA of medicinal products is, however, becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU member states. In addition, pursuant to Directive 
48

Table of Contents
2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU member states and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU member states.
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states where we conduct business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician and other healthcare provider payment transparency laws and regulations. Foreign governments also have comparable regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation.
The federal civil monetary penalties laws, impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.
In addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants, and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Drug manufacturers must report such payments to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year.
49

Table of Contents
State and foreign laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry and complicate our compliance efforts. For example, some states require companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the federal government’s compliance guidance or otherwise restrict payments to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. Some states require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information. Some state and local governments require the public registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to drug manufacturers may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU member states. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by national laws (including anti-bribery laws) of the EU member states. In the UK, the UK Bribery Act 2010 applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business”, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. This Act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and/or approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Failure to comply with the EU legislation and national laws on medicinal products including on the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU member state authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or signed the ACA, was signed into law, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to IMCIVREE and our potential drug candidates are:
●
an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee does not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
●
expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
●
expansion of manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans;
●
expansion of the list of entity types eligible for participation in the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program, or the 340B program, to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospitals, but exempting “orphan drugs,” such as IMCIVREE, from the 340B ceiling price requirements for these covered entities;
●
a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
●
established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. 
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, beginning January 1, 2024. The rebate was previously capped at 100% of a drug’s AMP.
Most significantly, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law.  This statute marks the most significant action by Congress with respect to the pharmaceutical industry since adoption of the ACA in 2010.  Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare, with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); redesigns the Medicare Part D benefit (beginning in 2024);  and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discount program (beginning in 2025).  CMS has published the negotiated prices for the initial ten drugs, which will first be effective in 2026, and has published the list of the subsequent 15 drugs that will be subject to negotiation.  The IRA permits the 
51

Table of Contents
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges.  While the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined, it is likely to be significant.   
Moreover, the federal government and individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in developing proposals, passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control drug pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, formulary flexibility, marketing cost disclosure, drug price increase disclosure and other transparency measures. Some states have enacted legislation creating so-called prescription drug affordability boards, which ultimately may attempt to impose price limits on certain drugs in these states. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare-related measures that may be adopted in the future, could materially reduce our ability to develop and commercialize IMCIVREE

 and our product candidates, if approved.
In the EU, on December 15, 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. The Regulation entered into force in January 2022 and has been applicable since January 2025, with phased implementation based on the type of product, i.e. oncology and advanced therapy medicinal products as of 2025, orphan medicinal products as of 2028, and all other medicinal products by 2030. The Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
