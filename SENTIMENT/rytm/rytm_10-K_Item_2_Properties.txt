Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we lease approximately 13,600 square feet of office space pursuant to lease agreements expiring in July 2030. This facility houses our research, clinical, regulatory, commercial and administrative personnel.  See Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about this lease.
We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our near-term needs, but we may need additional space as we grow and expand our operations. We believe that suitable additional or alternative office space would be available as required in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
