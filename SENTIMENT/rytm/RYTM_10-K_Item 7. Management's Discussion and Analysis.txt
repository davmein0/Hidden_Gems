Overview
We are a global, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. We are focused on advancing our melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists, including our lead asset, IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide), as precision medicines designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by MC4R pathway diseases. While obesity affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, we are advancing therapies for a subset of individuals who have hyperphagia, a pathological, insatiable hunger and impaired satiety accompanied by persistent and abnormal food-seeking behaviors, decreased energy expenditure and severe obesity due to diseases such as acquired or congenital hypothalamic obesity, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or other diseases caused by impaired MC4R pathway signaling. The MC4R pathway is a neuro-endocrine pathway in the brain that is responsible for regulating hunger, caloric intake and energy expenditure, which consequently affect body weight. IMCIVREE, an MC4R agonist for which we hold worldwide rights, is the first-ever therapy developed for patients with certain rare diseases that is approved or authorized in the United States, European Union (EU), United Kingdom, Canada and several other countries and regions. 
IMCIVREE is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with syndromic or monogenic obesity due to BBS or proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS). The European Commission (EC) and the United Kingdom’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized IMCIVREE for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 2 years of age and above. In addition to the United States, we have achieved market access or named patient sales for IMCIVREE for BBS or POMC and LEPR deficiencies, or both, in 15 countries outside the United States, and we continue to collaborate with authorities to achieve access in additional markets. 
With our efforts in hypothalamic obesity and other potential indications, we are advancing what we believe is the most comprehensive clinical research and development program ever initiated in MC4R pathway diseases, with multiple ongoing and planned clinical trials. Our MC4R pathway program is designed to expand the total number of patients who we believe could benefit from setmelanotide therapy or from one of our new drug candidates.  Our Phase 3 EMANATE trial, comprised of four independent substudies evaluating setmelanotide in genetically caused MC4R pathway diseases is ongoing.  Following the completion of our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial, we identified six genetically-defined cohorts that we believe merit further investigation for potential setmelanotide efficacy. We also are evaluating setmelanotide for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in a 26-week, open-label Phase 2 trial which was initiated at a single site in the United States during the first quarter of 2025. 
In addition to setmelanotide, we have two earlier-stage investigational MC4R agonists in clinical development, RM-718, designed for weekly administration, and bivamelagon, an oral small molecule, which are each advancing in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, respectively. These investigational assets are designed to be highly selective for the MC4R and MC1R sparing and thereby not cause hyperpigmentation. We completed enrollment in our Phase 2 trial evaluating bivamelagon, in acquired hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025. With RM-718, we anticipate initiating Part C of our Phase 1 trial to evaluate this weekly MC4R agonist in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025.
We are leveraging what we believe is the largest known DNA database focused on obesity - with approximately 100,000 sequencing samples as of December 31, 2024 - to improve the understanding, diagnosis and care of people living

with severe obesity due to certain variants in genes associated with the MC4R pathway. Our sequencing-based epidemiology estimates show that each of these genetically-defined MC4R pathway deficiencies are considered rare diseases, according to established definitions based on patient populations. Our epidemiology estimates are approximately 4,600 to 7,500 for U.S. patients in initial FDA-approved indications, including obesity due to BBS and biallelic POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiencies. Our epidemiology estimates for the two more prevalent indications being studied in our Phase 3 EMANATE trial (SH2B1 and POMC/PCSK1) suggest that approximately 29,000 U.S. patients with one of these genetically driven obesities have the potential to respond well to setmelanotide. Similarly, our epidemiology estimates for patients with genetic indications who demonstrated an initial response following stage 1 of our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial is approximately 65,300. All these patients face similar challenges as other patients with rare diseases, namely lack of awareness, resources, tests, tools and, especially, therapeutic options. 
We are developing setmelanotide to address additional patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. In our Phase 2 trial evaluating setmelanotide as a treatment for hypothalamic obesity, as announced in November 2022, 16 of 18 patients achieved the primary endpoint with a body mass index (BMI) decrease greater than 5 percent on setmelanotide therapy, and we observed a 14.5 mean percent reduction in BMI across all patients. As part of our November 2022 presentation, we detailed that fourteen of these patients transitioned from this Phase 2 trial into our open-label, long-term extension trial and they remained on therapy, as of November 3, 2023. Twelve of these 14 patients had achieved a 25.5% reduction in mean BMI from baseline at one year on setmelanotide therapy.  On February 22, 2024, we provided an update on progress of our pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating setmelanotide in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. We completed enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to enroll 120 patients aged 4 years or older randomized 2:1 to setmelanotide therapy or placebo for a total of 60 weeks, including up to eight weeks for dose titration. The primary endpoint is the percent change in BMI after approximately 52 weeks on a therapeutic regimen of setmelanotide versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients who achieve ≥5% reduction in BMI from baseline in adults (≥18) or BMI Z-score reduction of ≥0.2 from baseline in pediatrics after approximately 52 weeks on a therapeutic regimen of compared with placebo, and mean change in the weekly average of the daily most hunger score in patients ≥12 years from baseline after approximately 52 weeks on a therapeutic regimen of setmelanotide versus placebo. We expect to report top-line study results in the first half of 2025.
To date, we have not generated sufficient cash flow from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds received from the sales of common and preferred stock, royalty interest financing, asset sales, as well as capital contributions from the former parent company, Rhythm Holdings LLC. From August 2015 through August 2017, we raised aggregate net proceeds of $80.8 million through our issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below).  Since our initial public offering, or IPO, on October 10, 2017 and our underwritten follow-on offerings through October 2022, we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $832.7 million through the issuance of our common stock after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering related transaction costs. We also received $100.0 million from the sale of our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, or PRV, to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2021.  In June 2022, we entered into the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (“RIFA”), with entities managed by HealthCare Royalty Partners, collectively referred to as the Investors, and through December 31, 2024 have received cumulative proceeds of $96.7 million, net of certain transaction costs.  We also received $147.8 million in net proceeds under the Investment Agreement, with certain affiliates of Perceptive Advisors LLC, or Perceptive, and certain other investors, relating to the issuance and sale of 150,000 shares of a new series of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, titled the “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”, or the Convertible Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $150.0 million, or $1,000 per share.  As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $320.6 million. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2027.
We expect to continue to fund our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other sources. We have built our own marketing and commercial sales infrastructure in the United States and are in the process of building a similar infrastructure in several European markets and the United Kingdom.  We may enter into collaborations with other parties for certain markets outside the United States. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of setmelanotide.

As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,155.3 million. Our net losses were $260.6 million and $184.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses over the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
●
continue to conduct clinical trials for setmelanotide and our other product candidates;
●
engage contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of clinical and commercial-grade setmelanotide;
●
seek regulatory approval for setmelanotide for future indications, and for our other product candidates;
●
expand our clinical and financial operations and build a marketing and commercialization infrastructure; 
●
engage in the sales and marketing efforts necessary to support the continued commercial efforts of IMCIVREE globally;
●
take into account the levels, timing and collection of revenue earned from sales of IMCIVREE and other products approved in the future, if any; and
●
continue to operate as a public company.
As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $320.6 million.  We expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2024, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into 2027.
Corporate Background
We are a Delaware corporation organized in February 2013 under the name Rhythm Metabolic, Inc., and as of October 2015, under the name Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
            To date, we have generated approximately $227.6 million of revenue from product sales. Our lead product candidate, IMCIVREE, was approved by the FDA in November 2020 for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients six years of age and older with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency confirmed by genetic testing. IMCIVREE became commercially available in the United States in the first quarter of 2021.  We recorded our first sales of IMCIVREE in the United States in March 2021 and we made our first sales in France in March 2022 under the paid early access program.  IMCIVREE was approval by the FDA and the EC in adult and pediatric patients six years of age and older with obesity due to BBS in June and September 2022, respectively.  Following these approvals for BBS, sales of  IMCIVREE have grown, and we expect will continue to grow as we identify and treat more patients with this disease and obtain reimbursement throughout the international markets in which we operate.
Cost of sales

All of our inventory of IMCIVREE produced prior to FDA approval is available for commercial or clinical use.  Most of the manufacturing costs have been recorded as research and development expenses in prior periods.  
We expect cost of sales to increase in 2025 as we continue to sell inventory that is produced after we began capitalizing manufacturing costs for IMCIVREE commercial inventory.

Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery and genetic sequencing efforts, and the clinical development of setmelanotide, which include:
●
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf, and the cost of consultants and CMOs that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
●
employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;
●
the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical and clinical study materials;
●
the cost of genetic sequencing of potential patients in clinical studies;
●
facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs; 
●
acquired in process research and development costs associated with the acquisition of Xinvento B.V., or Xinvento in the three months ended March 31, 2023; and
●
acquired in process research and development costs associated with the acquisition of LG Chem, Ltd.’s, or LGC’s, proprietary compound bivamelagon in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
We expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

We are unable to predict the duration and costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of setmelanotide, RM-718, bivamelagon, and a potential therapeutic product candidate for congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will depend on a variety of factors, including:
●
the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities;
●
the rate of enrollment in clinical trials;
●
the safety and efficacy demonstrated by setmelanotide in future clinical trials;
●
changes in regulatory requirements;
●
changes in clinical trial design; and
●
the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.

Table of Contents
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with its development and potential commercialization.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our setmelanotide and other development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses to commercialization and there can be no guarantee that we can meet the funding needs associated with these expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling expenses consist of professional fees related to preparation for the commercialization of setmelanotide as well as salaries and related benefits for commercial employees, including stock-based compensation.  As we further implement and execute our commercialization plans to market setmelanotide in new territories and as we explore new collaborations to develop and commercialize setmelanotide, we anticipate that these expenses will materially increase.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, relating to our full-time employees not involved in R&D or commercial activities. Other significant costs include rent, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.
The following table summarizes our current selling, general and administrative expenses.

We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued and expanding commercialization efforts for IMCIVREE in the United States and the European Union as well as increased costs of operating as a global commercial stage biopharmaceutical public company. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, compliance with local rules and regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, exchange listing and SEC expenses, insurance and investor relations costs, among other expenses.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances on an ongoing basis, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. For all contracts that fall into the scope of ASC 606, we have identified one performance obligation: the sale of IMCIVREE to our customers. We have not incurred or capitalized any incremental costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers.
In the United States, which accounts for the largest portion of our total revenues, the Company sells its product to one material specialty pharmacy.  The product is distributed through third-party logistics, or 3PL, distribution agent that does not take title to the product.  Once the product is delivered to the Company’s specialty pharmacy provider, our customer in the United States, the customer (or “wholesaler”) takes title to the product.  The wholesaler then distributes the product to patients.  In our distribution agreement with the 3PL company, the Company acts as principal because we retain control of the product. Internationally, we make sales primarily to specialty distributors and retail pharmacy chains, as well as hospitals, many of which are government-owned or supported.  The Company offers returns of product sold to the customer on a limited basis, however, no material returns have been recognized to date.
Revenue is recorded at net selling price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration.  Our variable consideration consists of government rebates, trade discounts, product returns and other incentives.  The largest of our variable consideration components is government rebates for which reserves are established for estimated rebates for programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Tricare in the United States as well as certain government rebates and pricing adjustments in certain international markets that we operate.  We estimate these rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that take into consideration the estimated payer mix.  These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  On a quarterly basis, we update our estimates and record any necessary adjustments in the period identified.  Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.  Provisions for trade discounts, chargebacks and allowances are recorded as reductions to accounts receivable, and returns, government rebates, and other incentives are recorded as a component of accrued expenses.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate the value associated with goods and services received in the period in connection with research and development activities. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost, or alternatively, the deferral of amounts paid for goods or services to be incurred in the future. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses or prepaid expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time those financial statements are prepared. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs, CMOs and consultants in connection with research and development activities.
127

Table of Contents
We accrue our expenses related to CROs, CMOs and consultants based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs, CMOs and consultants that conduct research and development and manufacturing on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. The allocation of CRO upfront expenses for both clinical trials and preclinical studies generally tracks actual work activity. However, there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees delivered over a period of time, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust accrued or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
Stock-based compensation 
We maintain the Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, (the “2017 Plan”) which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock grants to employees, consultants, advisors and directors, as determined by the board of directors. As of December 31, 2024, we had reserved 12,475,344 shares of common stock under the 2017 Plan. Shares of common stock issued pursuant to awards are generally issued from authorized but unissued shares. The 2017 Plan provides that the exercise price of incentive stock options cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the award for participants who own less than 10% of the total combined voting power of stock, and not less than 110% for participants who own more than 10% of the voting power. Awards granted under the 2017 Plan will vest over periods as determined by our Compensation Committee and approved by our board of directors.
On February 9, 2022, our board of directors adopted the Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2022 Employment Inducement Plan (the “2022 Inducement Plan”), which became effective on such date without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC listing rules (“Rule 5635(c)(4)”).  The 2022 Inducement Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock grants. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4), awards under the 2022 Inducement Plan may only be made to a newly hired employee who has not previously been a member of our board of directors, or an employee who is being rehired following a bona fide period of non-employment by the Company or a subsidiary, as a material inducement to the employee’s entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiary. An aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2022 Inducement Plan. 
The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan will not be less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date. Other terms of awards, including vesting requirements, are determined by our board of directors and are subject to the provisions of the 2022 Inducement Plan. Stock options granted to employees generally vest over a four-year period but may be granted with different vesting terms. Certain options may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control. Stock options granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2024, there were 495,978 stock option awards outstanding, 317,554 restricted stock unit awards outstanding and 14,586 shares of common stock available for future grant under the 2022 Inducement Plan.
We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we previously based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We computed the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the 
128

Table of Contents
calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We estimate volatility by using a blend of our stock price history for the length of time we have market data for our stock and the historical volatility of similar public companies for the expected term of each grant.  We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. 
We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the "simplified" method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.  Upon adopting Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, 
Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)
 on July 1, 2018, we elected that unsettled equity-classified awards to nonemployees for which a measurement date has not been established be measured using the adoption date fair value.
Income taxes
We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740, 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, or ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any uncertain tax positions.
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, or Section 382, as well as similar state provisions and other provisions of the Code. Ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, occurs when there is a greater than 50% change in the ownership of stock among certain 5% shareholders over a three-year period.

Product revenue, net
 increased by $52.7 million to $130.1 million in 2024 from $77.4 million in 2023, an increase of 68%. 
We expect our sales of IMCIVREE to continue to increase following the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with BBS in the United States in June 2022.  We have achieved market access for IMCIVREE for BBS or POMC and LEPR deficiencies, or both, in more than 15 countries outside the United States, and we continue to collaborate with authorities to achieve access in additional markets. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,
 a substantial amount of our product revenue, or
 74% and 77%, respectively, was generated from sales of our product to patients in the United States. 
Cost of sales. 
Cost of sales increased by $4.1 million to $13.4 million in 2024 from $9.3 million in 2023, an increase of 44%, which was driven primarily by the increase in product revenue in 2024
.  Cost of sales is composed of royalty expense due to Ipsen on our net product sales, amortization of our capitalized sales-based milestone payment made to Ipsen, upon our first commercial sale in the United States and EU, the cost of product, as well as costs associated with our patient assistance programs.  Specifically, the $4.1 million increase in cost of sales in 2024 was due to $2.6 million of additional royalties due to our growth in sales and $1.5 million 
due to higher product costs from higher net product revenue.  
We expect cost of sales as a percentage of product revenue, net to continue to be in a range of 10% to 12% in foreseeable future.

Research and development expense. 
Research and development expense increased by $103.0 million to $238.0 million in 2024 from $135.0 million in 2023, an increase of 76%. The increase was primarily due to the following:
●
acquired in-process research and development costs associated with the acquisition of LGC’s proprietary compound bivamelagon of $92.4 million;
●
an increase of $8.1 million in salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation related to the hiring of additional full-time employees in order to support the growth of our research and development programs;
●
an increase of $7.5 million in our 
Phase 3 acquired hypothalamic obesity trial, our Phase 1 clinical trial of RM-718 and the Phase 2 bivamelagon trial acquired from LGC. 
These costs were partially offset by reduced 
130

Table of Contents
activity due to the completion and wind down of our long term extension trial, Phase 2 Basket trial, Phase 3 pediatrics trial, and switch trial;
 and
●
an increase of $4.3 million due to increased CMC development costs related to RM-718 and 
bivamelagon
. 
The above increases were partially offset by:
●
the purchase of in-process research and development assets of $5.7 million from Xinvento in 2023, which did not recur in 2024; and
●
a decrease in our clinical trial costs associated with decreased activity in our Phase 2 DAYBREAK trial and pediatrics trial for setmelanotide therapy of approximately $3.6 million.
Selling, general and administrative expense. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $26.8 million to $144.3 million in 2024 from $117.5 million in 2023, an increase of 23%. The increase was primarily due to the following:
●
an increase of $18.7 million due to increased compensation and benefits related costs associated with additional headcount to support our expanding business operations as well as to establish commercial operations in international regions
;
●
an increase of $6.7 million related to increased marketing and promotion costs to support continued revenue growth; and
●
an increase of $3.1 million related to professional services costs, 
 including legal, consulting and tax services.
The above increases were partially offset by:
●
a decrease in inventoriable costs that were capitalized to inventory as labor and overhead, of $1.7 million.   
Other income (expense), net.  
Other income (expense), net increased by $5.0 million to $5.2 million in 2024 from $0.2 million in 2023, which was due to the following:
●
a gain of $8.9 million recognized for the change in fair value of a forward contract recorded with the issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock;
 and
●
a change in fair value of the embedded derivative in our debt royalty obligation of $1.2 million, realized foreign currency gains of $0.4 million and other income of $0.4 million; and
●
an increase in interest income of $0.8 million earned on our short-term investments, based on higher investment balances from the net proceeds of $147.8 million from the convertible preferred stock issuance.
These increases were slightly offset by:
●
recognition of $4.0 million of non-cash interest expense in 2024 associated with accretion of the current liability payable to LGC in July 2025; and
●
an increase in non-cash interest expense of $2.7 million related to amortization of debt discount and deferred financing fees associated with our higher deferred royalty obligation balance, based on the receipt of our final $25.0 million sales milestone in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities
The use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of 
operating assets and liabilities
.
Net cash used in operating activities was $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $260.6 million adjusted for non-cash items of $43.8 million, which consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, non-cash accretion and amortization of short-term investments, non-cash accretion of other current liability, non-cash rent expense, gain on settlement of forward contract, and the change in the fair value of our embedded derivative liability.  
Our net loss also included $92.4 million of acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) assets, which are classified as investing activities. The change in operating assets and liabilities provided net cash of approximately $10.6 million, primarily driven by increases to accounts payable and accrued expenses of $21.9 million, net decreases in long-term assets of $7.9 million, offset by net increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $13.8 million and net increases to prepaid expenses of $5.5 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was $136.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $184.7 million adjusted for non-cash items of $38.0 million, which consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, non-cash rent expense, accretion and amortization of our short-term investments and the change in the fair value of our embedded derivative liability.  Our net loss also included $5.7 million of acquired IPR&D assets, which are classified as investing activities. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected a total net source of cash of approximately $4.8 million primarily driven by a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $14.8 million, decreases in long term assets of $1.7 million  and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.7 million.  The net cash sources described above were partially offset by net cash uses from increases in accounts receivable and inventory totaling $14.4 million, based on the ongoing growth in the business.
Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and related to purchases of short term investments for $268.3 million and cash used for the purchase of LGC’s proprietary compound bivamelagon for $40.0 million in January 2024, offset by gross maturities of short-term investments of $260.6 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 which related primarily to cash used to purchase Xinvento’s IPR&D assets in February 2023.  Our gross purchases of short-term 
132

Table of Contents
investments of $354.9 million were generally offset by gross proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $355.0 million. 
Net cash provided by financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $191.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and consisted of net proceeds of $147.8 million from the issuance of Convertible Perferred Stock as well as net proceeds from our ATM equity offering of $39.1 million.  We also received proceeds of $17.2 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock from our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. These proceeds were offset by $12.9 million of repayments on our deferred royalty obligation. 
Net cash provided by financing activities was $74.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consisted of  net proceeds of $48.9 million from the issuance of common stock in August 2023, net proceeds of $24.4 million from the final investment tranche of our deferred royalty obligation and $8.5 million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock from the ESPP. These proceeds were partially offset by $7.4 million of repayments of our deferred royalty obligation. 
Revenue Interest Financing Agreement
On June 16, 2022, we entered into the RIFA with HealthCare Royalty, for a total investment amount of up to $100 million. In exchange for the total investment amount to be received by us, HealthCare Royalty will receive a tiered royalty based on global net product sales generated by IMCIVREE. For additional information, see Note 11, “Long-term Obligations” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Funding requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the clinical development of and seek marketing approval for setmelanotide for future indications and build out our global organization. In addition, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. We also expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2027. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions in amounts that exceed federally-insured limits. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all.

We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our research and development activities and any continuing operations thereafter. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the costs to commercialize setmelanotide, by building an internal sales force or entering into collaborations with third parties and providing support services for patients;
●
the scope, progress, results and costs of clinical trials for our setmelanotide program, as well as for RM-718 and 
bivamelagon
, and in connection with a therapeutic product candidate for CHI;
●
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our setmelanotide program; as well as for RM-718 and 
bivamelagon
, and in connection with a therapeutic product candidate for CHI;
133

Table of Contents
●
the costs related to the acquisition, integration, research and development and commercialization efforts related to the acquisition of Xinvento B.V. and any related therapeutic product candidates;
●
the obligations owed to Ipsen, Camurus and LG Chem, pursuant to our license agreements;
●
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
●
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
●
our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and
●
the costs of operating as a public company and losing our emerging growth company status.
Although IMCIVREE has been approved by the FDA in certain indications, and became commercially available in the first quarter of 2021, IMCIVREE may not achieve commercial success. In addition, developing our setmelanotide program is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain future marketing approvals and achieve product sales. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 
Further, the global economy, including credit and financial markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rising interest and inflation rates, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. All of these factors could impact our liquidity and future funding requirements, including but not limited to our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. The duration of this economic slowdown is uncertain and the impact on our business is difficult to predict. See “Risk Factors— Unfavorable global political or economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.  
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, involves agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our setmelanotide program on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our setmelanotide program that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
ATM
On November 2, 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million, from time to time through an “at the market” equity offering program under which Cowen acts as sales agent (the “ATM Program”). Between August 10, 2023 and August 21, 2023, we sold approximately two million shares of our common stock in the ATM Program for net proceeds of approximately $48.9 million.
134

Table of Contents
On February 29, 2024, we and Cowen entered into Amendment No. 1 to Sales Agreement (the “Amendment”) to increase the aggregate offering price of the shares of common stock that may be issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement to $200.0 million (excluding the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement prior to February 29, 2024). In connection with the Amendment, on February 29, 2024, we filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement, dated February 29, 2024, which, combined with the Base Prospectus (together, the “New Prospectus”), amended the Prior Prospectus in its entirety. The issuances and sales under the Sales Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, will be made pursuant to the Registration Statement and the New Prospectus.
Beginning on December 10, 2024 the company sold 744,595 shares of common stock in the ATM program for net proceeds of $41.2 million as of December 31, 2024.  The company sold an additional 587,510 shares of common stock in the ATM program through January 21, 2025 for net proceeds of approximately $32.1 million.
Other funding
On September 19, 2022, we completed a public offering of 4,800,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $26.00 per share. We received $116,887 in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In addition, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 720,000 shares of its common stock at the price to the public, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 18, 2022, we completed the sale of an additional 580,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $26.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $14,175, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
In April 2024, we received $147.8 million in net proceeds under the Investment Agreement, with certain affiliates of Perceptive Advisors LLC, or Perceptive, and certain other investors, relating to the issuance and sale of 150,000 shares of a new series of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $150.0 million, or $1,000 per share.  
Contractual obligations
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs and CMOs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for clinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes. We do not classify these as contractual obligations where the contracts are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days' prior written notice to the vendor.
Milestone and royalty payments associated with our license agreements with Ipsen, Camurus, and LG Chem, have not been included as contractual obligations as we cannot reasonably estimate if or when they will occur. Under the terms of the Ipsen license agreement, assuming that setmelanotide is successfully developed, receives regulatory approval and is commercialized, Ipsen may receive aggregate payments of up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones under the license agreement and royalties on future product sales and at December 31, 2024 there were $27.0 million of remaining milestones that may be achieved and due to Ipsen at a future date. During 2022, we paid Ipsen a $4.0 million milestone upon our first commercial sale of IMCIVREE in Europe.  We did not make additional milestone payments to Ipsen during 2023 or 2024.  In the event that we enter into a sublicense agreement, we will make payments to Ipsen, depending on the date of the sublicense agreement, ranging from 10% to 20% of all revenues actually received under the sublicense agreement. 
Under the terms of the Camurus license agreement, assuming that the weekly formulation of setmelanotide is successfully developed, receives regulatory approval and is commercialized, Camurus may receive aggregate payments of up to $64.8 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones under the license agreement and royalties on future product sales.  As of December 31, 2024, there were $62.5 million of remaining milestones that may be achieved and for which Camurus would receive payment at a future date. We paid Camurus a $1.0 million milestone in 2022 upon the achievement of a development milestone.  We did not make any milestone payments to Camurus during 2023 or 2024. The majority of the aggregate payments under the Camurus license agreement are for milestones that may be achieved no earlier than first commercial sale of this weekly formulation of setmelanotide.  
135

Table of Contents
Under the terms of the LG Chem license agreement, we have paid LG Chem $40 million in cash, issued shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $20 million and
 agreed to make a $40 million payment in cash 18 months after the effective date of the license agreement.  
We have also agreed to pay LG Chem up to $205 million in cash upon achieving various regulatory and sales milestones based on net sales of 
bivamelagon
.  In addition and subject to the completion of Phase 2 development of 
bivamelagon
, the Company has agreed to pay LGC royalties of between low-to-mid single digit percent of net revenues from its MC4R portfolio, including 
bivamelagon
, commencing in 2029 and dependent upon achievement of various regulatory and indication approvals, and subject to customary deductions and anti-stacking. Royalties may further increase to a low double digit percent royalty, though such royalty would only be applicable on net sales of 
bivamelagon
 in a region if 
bivamelagon
 is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent controlled by LGC in such region and the Company’s MC4R portfolio is not covered by any composition of matter or method of use patents controlled by the Company in such region. Such increased rate would only apply on net sales of 
bivamelagon
 for the limited remainder of the royalty term in the relevant region.  We entered into this agreement in 2024 and have not yet made any milestone payments.
Based on our current development plans as of December 31, 2024, we expect to make milestone payments to third parties, during the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report. These milestones include a $40.0 million payment to LG Chem in July of 2025 (which is the second and final license fee installment, payable to LGC within eighteen (18) months of the effective date of the LG Chem license agrreement) and a $2.0 million payment to the sellers of Xinvento upon the commencement of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity trials (currently expected to begin in 2025. Milestones generally become due and payable upon achievement of such milestones or sales. When the achievement of these milestones or sales have not occurred, such contingencies are not recorded in our financial statements and are excluded from the table below.
On May 2, 2024, we entered into an agreement to amend the current operating lease agreement for our head office facility 
in Boston, Massachusetts
. Under the amendment, the current lease was extended for five years through July 31, 2030.  
The lease includes approximately 13,600 square feet of office space.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of pending and recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
​
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments, including cash equivalents, are in the form, or may be in the form of, money market funds or marketable securities and are or may be invested in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency obligations. Due to the short-term maturities and low risk profiles of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investments. 
We are not materially exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
​
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
​
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
​
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Based upon such assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Material Weakness in Internal Control
​
As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls, or ITGCs, in the areas of user access and program change management over our key accounting and reporting information technology, or IT, system. As a result, the related business process controls (IT application controls and IT-dependent manual controls) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that use data produced from the system impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, were also ineffective.
The material weakness identified above did not result in any material misstatements in our financial statements or disclosures, and there were no changes to previously released financial results.  
Remediation of Material Weakness
​
Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness above, we implemented measures designed to improve internal control over financial reporting to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness.
Our remediation actions included: (i) developing and implementing additional training and awareness programs addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on user access; (ii) increasing the extent of oversight and verification checks included in the operation of user access and program change management controls and processes; (iii) deploying additional tools to support administration of user access and program change management; and (iv) enhancing quarterly management reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
137

Table of Contents
Management has concluded that the material weaknesses described above have been remediated. The applicable controls have been in place for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls operated effectively.
C
hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
​
Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Attestation of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
​
Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
​
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
​
We have audited Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Critical Audit Matter
​
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Accrued and Prepaid Research and Development Expenses related to Phase 3 EMANATE, Phase 3 evaluation of setmelanotide on acquired hypothalamic obesity and Phase 2 evaluation of bivamelagon on acquired hypothalamic obesity clinical trials
Description of the Matter
​
​
The Company’s accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to research and development costs were $17.9 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets related to research and development costs were $7.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s research and development 
F-2

Table of Contents
expenses are based on the Company’s estimates of the progress of the related studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received, and contracted costs, which results in an accrual or prepayment at the balance sheet date.
​
Auditing certain of the Company’s accrued and prepaid research and development expenses for clinical trials was complex and judgmental, as accounting for the costs associated with these clinical trials required significant estimates of the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred by service providers. Additionally, due to the long duration of these clinical trials and the timing of invoicing received from third parties, the actual amounts incurred are not always known prior to the issuance of the Company’s financial statements.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
To evaluate the prepaid and accrued research and development costs for these clinical trials at December 31, 2024, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimates and evaluating the significant judgements and estimates made by management to determine the recorded prepaid and accrued amounts. To test the significant judgments and estimates, we corroborated the progress of research and development activities through discussion with the Company’s research and development personnel that oversee the research and development projects and inspected the Company’s contracts with third parties and any pending change orders to assess the impact on amounts recorded. In addition, we tested estimates of costs incurred to date by confirming actual costs incurred with the relevant third parties and through review of invoices received by the Company. We also analyzed fluctuations in prepaid and accrued amounts by vendor and by trial throughout the period subject to audit, evaluated the costs incurred per trial, site and/or patient for reasonableness and tested subsequent invoices received from third parties

​
Allowances for Rebates under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program
​
​
​
Description of the Matter
​
As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales based on amounts due from customers net of allowances for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes, among others, rebates mandated by law under Medicaid. The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration in its transaction price at the time of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company estimates its Medicaid Drug Rebate Program accruals based on monthly sales, historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and jurisdictions, contractual rebate rates and estimated lag time of the rebate invoices. Rebate accruals inclusive of estimated amounts payable for claims not yet received or processed as part of the Company’s Medicaid program are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
​
Auditing the allowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the U.S. was complex and judgmental due to the complexity of the government mandated calculations. The allowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the U.S. are sensitive to these calculations.
​
​

Table of Contents
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
​
Our audit procedures to test the allowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program included, among others, procedures to assess the methodology used to determine the allowance, procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analysis and procedures to test the significant assumptions utilized. To assess the methodology used to determine the allowance, we involved our government pricing specialists to assist in evaluating the Company’s methodology and calculations to measure certain estimated rebates. To test the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s analysis, we compared the data used in the Company’s calculations to third-party invoices, historical claims data and actual cash payments through the date of the Company’s financial statements. To test the significant assumptions used in the analysis, we involved our government pricing specialists to assist us evaluating the calculations to measure certain estimated rebates.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement
s
 (In thousands, except share and per share information)
1. Nature of Business
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) is a global, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients and their families living with rare neuroendocrine  diseases. We are focused on advancing our melanocortin-4 receptor agonists, including our lead asset, IMCIVREE
®
 (setmelanotide), as a precision medicine designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by MC4R pathway diseases. While obesity affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, we are developing therapies for a subset of individuals who have hyperphagia, a pathological hunger, and severe obesity due to an impaired MC4R pathway, which may be caused by traumatic injury or genetic variants. The MC4R pathway is an endocrine pathway in the brain that is responsible for regulating hunger, caloric intake and energy expenditure, which consequently affect body weight. IMCIVREE, an MC4R agonist for which we hold worldwide rights, is the first-ever therapy developed for patients with certain rare diseases that is approved or authorized in the United States, European Union (EU), Great Britain, Canada and other countries and regions
.
              The Company is a Delaware corporation organized in February 2013 under the name Rhythm Metabolic, Inc., and as of October 2015, under the name Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc.  The Company has wholly owned subsidiaries in the US, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan and Canada.
​
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to commercial-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including but not limited to, risks associated with the commercialization of approved products, completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, receiving regulatory approvals for product candidates, development by competitors of new biopharmaceutical products, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Commercialization of approved products will require significant resources and in order to market IMCIVREE, the Company must continue to build its sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even though the Company has an approved product, and even if the Company’s further product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize sufficient revenue from product sales to fund operations.

​
Liquidity
The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
1,155,338
.  T
he Company has primarily funded these losses through the proceeds from the sales of our common stock and preferred stock, asset sales, royalty financing, out-license arrangements, as well as capital contributions received from the former parent company, Rhythm Holdings LLC. To date, the Company has minimal product revenue and management expects operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to its drug development efforts, comprising of research and development, the acquisition of in process research and development assets, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for its product candidates, protecting its intellectual property, commercialization activities and general and administrative functions relating to these operations. The future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
320,565
 of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand.  In the future, the Company will be dependent on obtaining funding from third parties, such as proceeds from the 
F-9

Table of Contents
issuance of debt, sale of equity, proceeds from out license arrangements, product sales and funded research and development programs to maintain the Company's operations and meet the Company's obligations. There is no guarantee that additional equity or other financings will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company fails to obtain additional funding when needed, the Company would be forced to scale back, terminate its operations or seek to merge with or be acquired by another company. Management believes that the Company's existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations through at least the next twelve months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC.  
​
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. This process may result in actual results differing materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of the financial statements if these results differ from historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such assumptions are reasonable when made. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include but are not limited to, estimates related to determining our net product revenue, and accruals related to research and development expenses. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.  Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company currently operates in 
two
 business segments, which are U.S. and international segments for the development and commercialization of therapies for patients with rare diseases. A single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer comprehensively manages the entire business. The Company meets the aggregation criteria of ASC 280 and therefore has 
one
 reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024.  
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which improves segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure requirements for significant segment expenses. The improved disclosure requirements apply to all public entities that are required to report segment information, including those with only 
one
 reportable segment. The Company adopted the guidance in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. There was no impact on the Company’s reportable segments identified and additional required disclosures have been included in Note 15.

Table of Contents
Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which are maintained at 
two
 federally insured financial institutions. The deposits held at these 
two
 institutions are in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. The Company has no off-balance sheet risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
              The Company is exposed to risks associated with extending credit to customers related to the sale of products. The Company does not require collateral to secure amounts due from its customers. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
74
% and 
77
%
, respectively, of all of the Company’s revenue was generated from a single customer in the United States.  
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
67
%
 and 
67
%
, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable was outstanding from a single customer in the United States.
​
              The Company relies on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for manufacturing and supply of its product. The inability of the suppliers or manufacturers to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results. A change in the relationship with the suppliers or manufacturer, or an adverse change in their business, could materially impact future operating results.
​
           The Company relies on separate third parties to perform genetic testing in the United States and Europe, respectively. The inability of the vendor to fulfill testing services for the Company could materially impact future operating results and adversely impact our ability to further develop setmelanotide. A change in the relationship with the genetic testing service providers, or an adverse change in their business, could materially impact future operating results.
​
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with remaining maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes bank demand deposits, U.S. treasury bills and money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. government treasuries.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist of investments with maturities greater than 90 days, as of the date of purchase. The Company has classified its investments with maturities beyond one year as short term, based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. The Company considers its investment portfolio available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.  To the extent the amortized cost basis of the available-for-sale debt securities exceeds the fair value, management assesses the debt securities for credit loss; however, management considers the risk of credit loss to be minimized by the Company's policy of investing in financial instruments issued by highly-rated financial institutions. When assessing the risk of credit loss, management considers factors such as the severity and the reason of the decline in value (i.e., any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency or other adverse conditions specifically related to the security) and management's intended holding period and time horizon for selling. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not recognize any credit losses related to its available-for-sale debt securities. Further, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses related to its available-for-sale debt securities. 
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of security deposits in the form of letters of credit placed in separate restricted bank accounts as required under the terms of the Company’s lease arrangement for its corporate office in Boston, Massachusetts and the Company’s corporate travel credit card.
F-11

Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable, net

Accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers, net of customer allowances for cash discounts and any estimated expected credit losses. The Company's measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. To date, the Company has not experienced any material credit losses. The Company's contracts with its customers have customary payment terms that generally require payment within 90 days. The Company analyzes amounts that are past due for collectability, and periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of its customer.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined an allowance for doubtful account was not required based upon its review of contractual payments and its customer payment histories. 
​
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Product Revenue, Net
In the United States, which accounts for the largest portion of our total revenues, the Company sells its product to 
one
 material specialty pharmacy.  The product is distributed through third-party logistics, or 3PL, distribution agent that does not take title to the product.  Once the product is delivered to the Company’s specialty pharmacy provider, our customer in the United States, the customer (or “wholesaler”) takes title to the product.  The wholesaler then distributes the product to patients.  In our distribution agreement with the 3PL company, the Company acts as principal because we retain control of the product. Internationally, we make sales primarily to specialty distributors and retail pharmacy chains, as well as hospitals, many of which are government-owned or supported.  The Company offers returns of product sold to the customer on a limited basis, however, no material returns have been recognized to date.
Revenue from product sales is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, upon transfer of title to the customer because at that point in time we have no ongoing obligations to the customer.  There are no other performance obligations besides the sale of product.  We classify payments to our customers or other parties in the distribution channel for services that are distinct and priced at fair value as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Otherwise, payments to a customer or other parties in the distribution channel that do not meet those criteria are classified as a reduction of revenue, as discussed further below.  Taxes collected from the customer relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.  Because our payment terms are generally ninety days or less, the Company concluded there is not a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.  The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred since the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.
Reserves for Variable Consideration
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or the transaction price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, rebates, and co-pay assistance that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers and other indirect customers relating to the sale of IMCIVREE.  These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer).  Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.  Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract.  The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal 
F-12

Table of Contents
in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period.  Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates.  If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
The following are the components of variable consideration related to product revenue:
Government rebates:
  The Company is subject to discount obligations under government programs, including U.S. Medicaid programs, Medicare and Tricare in the United States as well as certain government rebates and pricing adjustments in certain international markets that we operate.  We estimate these rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that take into consideration the estimated payer mix.  These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  On a quarterly basis, we update our estimates and record any necessary adjustments in the period that we identify the adjustments.
Trade discounts and allowances:
  The Company provides customary invoice discounts on IMCIVREE sales to certain of our customers for items such as prompt payment. These are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized.  In addition, we receive and pay for various distribution services from our customers in the distribution channel.  For services that are not distinct from the sale of our product, such fees are classified as a reduction of product revenue.
Product returns:  
Our customers have limited return rights related to the product’s damage or defect.  The Company estimates the amount of product sales that may be returned and records the estimate as a reduction of revenue and a refund liability in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Based on the distribution model for IMCIVREE, the Company believes there will be minimal returns and these reserves have not been material to date.
Other incentives:
  Other incentives include co-payment assistance the Company provides to patients with commercial insurance that have coverage and reside in states that allow co-payment assistance.  The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue.  The estimate is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
Provisions for trade discounts, chargebacks and allowances are recorded as reductions to accounts receivable, and returns, government rebates, and other incentives are recorded as a component of accrued expenses.

Table of Contents
License Agreements
We generate revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates. Such agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses, transfer of technological know-how, delivery of drug substances, research and development services, and participation on certain committees with the counterparty. Payments made by the customers may include non-refundable upfront fees, payments upon the exercise of customer options, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and royalties on sales of products and product candidates if they are approved and commercialized.
If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize the transaction price allocated to the license as revenue upon transfer of control of the license. We evaluate all other promised goods or services in the agreement to determine if they are distinct. If they are not distinct, they are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that is distinct. Optional future services where any additional consideration paid to us reflects their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations. If optional future services are priced in a manner which provides the customer with a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights, and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. 
We utilize judgment to determine the transaction price. In connection therewith, we evaluate contingent milestones at contract inception to estimate the amount which is not probable of a material reversal to include in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore the variable consideration is constrained. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achieving development milestone payments that may not be subject to a material reversal and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue, as well as earnings, in the period of adjustment. 
We then determine whether the performance obligations or combined performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of progress, as applicable, for each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded within deferred revenue. Contract liabilities within deferred revenue are recognized as revenue after control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments, and a license of intellectual property that is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).  Refer to Note 10 “Significant Agreements”, for discussion related to the Company’s accounting for the  RareStone Group, Ltd. agreement.
Deferred Royalty Obligation 
We treat the debt obligation to HealthCare Royalty Management, LLC as discussed further in Note 11, “Long-Term Obligations”, as a deferred royalty obligation, amortized using the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the revenue streams. We recognize interest expense thereon using the effective rate, which is based on our current estimates of future revenues over the life of the arrangement. In connection therewith, we periodically assess our expected revenues using internal projections, impute interest on the carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation, and record interest expense using the imputed effective interest rate. To the extent our estimates of future revenues are greater or less 
F-14

Table of Contents
than previous estimates or the estimated timing of such payments is materially different than previous estimates, we will account for any such changes by adjusting the effective interest rate on a prospective basis, with a corresponding impact to the reclassification of our deferred royalty obligation. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the deferred royalty obligation and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the classification of such costs, as well as the period over which such costs will be amortized.
Inventory
Prior to receiving approval from the FDA in November 2020 to sell IMCIVREE in the United States, the Company expensed all costs incurred related to the manufacture of IMCIVREE as research and development expense because of the inherent risks associated with the development of a drug candidate, the uncertainty about the regulatory approval process and the lack of history for the Company of regulatory approval of drug candidates. The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines the cost of inventories, which includes amounts related to materials and manufacturing overhead, on a first-in, first-out basis. Raw materials and work in process includes all inventory costs prior to packaging and labelling, including raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, and drug product. Finished goods include packaged and labelled products. Raw materials and work in process that may be used for either research and development or commercial sale are classified as inventory until the material is consumed or otherwise allocated for research and development. If the material is intended to be used for research and development, it is expensed as research and development once that determination is made.   
Inventory consists of the following:

Cost of Product Sales

Cost of product sales consists of manufacturing costs, transportation and freight, amortization of capitalized intangibles, royalty payments and indirect overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and distribution of IMCIVREE. Cost of product sales may also include periodic costs related to certain manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges.  Finally, cost of sales may also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances.
Intangible Assets, net
Definite-lived intangible assets related to capitalized milestones under license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, which are estimated to be the remaining patent life. If our estimate of the product’s useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then a shorter period is used. Amortization expense is recorded as a component in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. The Company measures recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the Company measures the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, less the cost to

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon disposal, retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Acquired IPR&D and Milestone Expense
In an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process research and development projects are expensed as acquired IPR&D and recorded as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive net loss unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.
Foreign Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense amounts for these subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. Changes resulting from foreign currency translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity.  Net foreign currency exchange transaction gains (losses), which are included in other (expense) income, net on our consolidated statements of operations, were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
​
Level 1 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
​
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
​
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
​
The Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities and derivative liability at December 31, 2024 and  2023 were carried at fair value, determined according to the fair value hierarchy.  See Note 5 for further discussion.
The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Research and Development Expenses
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company’s products are expensed to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs. The value of goods and services received from contract research organizations, or CROs, or contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in the reporting period are estimated based on the level of services performed and progress in the period for which the Company has not yet received an invoice from the supplier.  When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any 
F-17

Table of Contents
reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.
Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses, and expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
Income Taxes
The Company is taxed as a C corporation for federal income tax purposes. Income taxes for the Company are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Income taxes have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 accrued interest or penalties are included as a component of accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration of potential dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by adjusting the weighted-average shares outstanding for the potential dilutive effects of common stock equivalents outstanding during the period calculated in accordance with the more dilutive of the if-converted or treasury stock method. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for all periods presented.
F-18

The following table includes the potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive effect, under either the treasury stock or if-converted method for the periods indicated:

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss represents the net change in stockholders’ equity during a period from sources other than transactions with shareholders. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, our comprehensive loss is comprised of net losses, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities.  These changes in equity are reflected net of tax.
Patent Costs
Costs to secure and defend patents are expensed as incurred and are classified as general and administrative expenses. Patent costs were $
1,311
, $
555
 and $
406
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Subsequent Events
The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements to provide additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Subsequent events have been evaluated as required.  See Note 16.
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, or ASU 2023-09. The new guidance requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in the ASU are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update are effective for us beginning in fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements which is expected to result in enhanced disclosures, however, we do not otherwise expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure requirements for significant segment expenses. The improved disclosure requirements apply to all public entities that are required to report segment information, including those with only 
one
 reportable segment. The Company adopted the guidance in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. There was no impact on the Company’s reportable segments identified and additional required disclosures have been included in Note 15.

3.  Asset Acquisitions
LG Chem, Ltd.
On January 4, 2024, the Company entered into a license agreement and share issuance agreement with LG Chem, Ltd. (“LGC”).  Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company obtained worldwide rights to LGC’s proprietary compound bivamelagon and assumed sponsorship of two ongoing LGC Phase 2 studies designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of bivamelagon. 
​
The total purchase consideration of $
92.4
 million consisted of cash payments with a present value of $
73.7
 million and $
18.7
 million in the Company’s common shares. At closing, $
40.0
 million of cash paid was paid and shares were issued at a per share price equal to the 
ten
-day volume weighted average closing price for our common stock, calculated as of the trading day immediately prior to January 4, 2024. The total purchase consideration also includes an additional $
40.0
 million license fee payable 
18 months
 from the date of execution, whose present value at closing was $
33.7
 million and is being accreted to its full value through interest expense. The company recorded $
0.8
 million of transaction costs associated with this transaction, which are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The carrying value of the license fee payable is $
37.7
 million as of December 31, 2024.
​
In addition, under the terms of the license agreement, we agreed to pay LGC up to $
205
 million in cash upon achieving various regulatory and sales milestones based on net sales of bivamelagon.  In addition and subject to the completion of Phase 2 development of bivamelagon, the Company has agreed to pay LGC royalties of between low-to-mid single digit percent of net revenues from its MC4R portfolio, including bivamelagon, commencing in 2029 and dependent upon achievement of various regulatory and indication approvals, and subject to customary deductions and anti-stacking. Royalties may further increase to a low double digit percent royalty, though such royalty would only be applicable on net sales of bivamelagon in a region if bivamelagon is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent controlled by LGC in such region and the Company’s MC4R portfolio is not covered by any composition of matter or method of use patents controlled by the Company in such region. Such increased rate would only apply on net sales of bivamelagon for the limited remainder of the royalty term in the relevant region.
​
The assets acquired were In-Process Research and Development (“IPR&D”) assets.  However, since the IPR&D assets were determined to have no alternative future use, the Company recognized the $
92.4
 million of purchase consideration as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company determined that the additional contingent consideration did not meet the definition of a derivative as of the acquisition date.  Therefore, the Company did not record a contingent consideration liability on the acquisition date.  The Company will recognize any future contingent consideration payments related to the LGC transaction in the period in which the achievement of the underlying milestones becomes probable. 
​
Xinvento B.V.
On February 27, 2023, the Company, through its wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Netherlands B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (“Rhythm BV”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Xinvento B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company based in the Netherlands (“Xinvento”), and the other parties named therein, pursuant to which, and concurrently with the execution thereof, Rhythm BV acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Xinvento. The aggregate consideration at closing was approximately $
5.7
 million, inclusive of transaction costs, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and subject to the distribution and payment terms set forth therein (the “Closing Purchase Price”).  
In addition to the Closing Purchase Price, the Purchase Agreement provides for the payment of additional contingent consideration totaling up to $
206
 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones by Xinvento, as follows: (i) up to an aggregate of $
6
 million in clinical development milestones; (ii) up to an aggregate of $
125
 million in regulatory approval and commercial milestones; and (iii) up to an aggregate of $
75
 million in sales milestones in the event a second molecule is selected, developed and approved.
F-20

Table of Contents
The total purchase consideration of $
5.7
 million was composed of $
4.5
 million of cash paid at closing, a $
0.5
 million holdback, payable on the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, and $
0.6
 million of acquisition-related costs.  The $
0.5
 million holdback was paid in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and is reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company determined that substantially all of the value as of acquisition date related to Xinvento’s In-Process Research and Development.  As a result, the Company determined this transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition.    
The assets acquired were In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) assets.  However, since the IPR&D assets were determined to have no alternative future use, the Company recognized the $
5.7
 million of purchase consideration as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2023.
The Company determined that the additional contingent consideration did not meet the definition of a derivative as of the acquisition date.  Therefore, the Company did not record a contingent consideration liability on the acquisition date.  The Company will recognize any future contingent consideration payments related to the Xinvento transaction in the period in which the achievement of the underlying milestones becomes probable.
Xinvento's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net loss associated with the operations of Xinvento was de minimis in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $
320,565
 and $
275,846
, respectively, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments includes investments in U.S. treasury securities and money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities that are valued using quoted market prices. Accordingly, money market funds and government funds are categorized as Level 1.  The financial assets valued based on Level 2 inputs consist of corporate debt securities and commercial paper, which consist of investments in highly-rated investment-grade corporations. 
The embedded derivative (asset) or liability associated with our deferred royalty obligation, as discussed further in Note 12, “Long-Term Obligations”, is measured at fair value using an option pricing Monte Carlo simulation model and is included as a component of the deferred royalty obligation. The embedded derivative (asset) or liability is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of other (expense) income, net. The assumptions used in the option pricing Monte Carlo simulation model include: (1) our estimates of the probability and timing of related events; (2) the probability-weighted net sales of IMCIVREE, including worldwide net product sales, upfront payments, milestones and royalties; (3) our risk-adjusted discount rate that includes a company specific risk premium; (4) our cost of debt; (5) volatility; and (6) the probability of a change in control occurring during the term of the instrument.
The forward contract associated with our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as discussed further in Note 9, “Series A Preferred Stock”, is measured at fair value. In order to value the forward contract, a binomial lattice model was used to determine the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock.  The fair value of the forward contract was measured as the difference between the consideration payable of $
150,000
 and the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The fair value of the forward contract was determined to be $
0
 at initial issuance and the change in the fair value from initial issuance to settlement of $
8,900
 was recognized as other income in the condensed consolidated statements of operation for the year ended December 31, 2024. The significant assumptions used in the binomial lattice model include: (1) the Company’s common stock price on the issuance and settlement dates; (2) the Conversion Price as of $
48.00
 as per the Agreement; (3) a 
20-year
 term to maturity; (4) risk free rates (
4.6
% - 
5
%); and (5) volatility (
68
% and 
67
%).

10
% of the total combined voting power of stock of the Company, and not less than 
110
% for participants who own more than 
10
% of the Company's voting power. Awards granted under the 2017 Plan will vest over periods as determined by the Company's board of directors. For options granted to date, the exercise price equaled the fair value of the common stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant.

The 2022 Inducement Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock grants. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4), awards under the 2022 Inducement Plan may only be made to a newly hired employee who has not previously been a member of the Company’s board of directors, or an employee who is being rehired following a bona fide period of non-employment by the Company or a subsidiary, as a material inducement to the employee’s entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiary. An aggregate of

1,872,738
 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 ESPP.

1
% of outstanding shares as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. On January 1, 2025, 2024 and 2023, no shares were added to the 2017 ESPP.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no such January 1 increase in the number of shares authorized under the 2017 ESPP for such year, or that the increase in the number of shares authorized under the 2017 ESPP for such year will be a lesser number than would otherwise occur pursuant to the preceding sentence. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, shares of 
44,554
, 
49,819
, and 
92,932

85.0
% of the lower of (i) the market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period or (ii) the market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our ESPP is calculated using the Black-

Scholes model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 
15.0
% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 6 month purchase period.
​
Stock Options
The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of the underlying common stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. The Company bases its estimate of expected volatility using a blend of its stock price history for the length of time it has market data for its stock and using the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as the Company that are publicly traded. For these analyses, the Company selected companies with comparable characteristics to its own including enterprise value, risk profiles and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards.  The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. 
The Company estimated the expected life of its employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted.  We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.
The grant date fair value of awards subject to service-based vesting is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The Company's stock option awards typically vest over a service period that ranges from 
one
 to 
four years
 and includes awards with 
one year
 cliff vesting followed by ratable monthly and quarterly vesting thereafter and ratable monthly and quarterly vesting beginning on the grant date.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted 
926,543
, 
842,528
, and 
1,929,345
 stock option awards pursuant to the 2017 Plan to certain directors, employees and non-employees, respectively.  Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted-average grant date fair value relating to outstanding stock options granted under the 2017 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022  was $
32.69
, $
17.72
, and $
4.14
, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted 
57,100
, 
229,360
, and 
347,985
 stock option awards pursuant to the 2022 Inducement Plan.  Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted-average grant date fair value relating to outstanding stock options granted under the Company’s stock option plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
29.16
, $
15.30
, and $
13.05
, respectively. 
The fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

9. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
On April 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with certain affiliates of Perceptive Advisors LLC (“Perceptive”) and certain other investors (each, an “Investor” and collectively, the “Investors”), relating to the issuance and sale of 
150,000
 shares of a new series of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $
0.001
 per share, titled the “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $
147,750
, net of $
2,250
 of issuance costs, or $
1,000
 per share (the “Issuance”).  The Issuance closed on April 15, 2024.  
The Company determined the obligation to issue 
150,000
 shares of 
Convertible Preferred Stock
 to Perceptive and Investors in the future at a set price represented a forward contract which was required to be accounted for at fair value.

The fair value of the forward contract was measured as the difference between the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as determined using a binomial lattice valuation model, and the consideration payable to the Company. 
The assumptions used in the binomial lattice model include: (1) the Company’s common stock price on the issuance and settlement dates; (2) the Conversion Price as of $
48.00
 as per the Agreement; (3) a 
20-year
 term to maturity; (4) risk-free rates; and (5) volatility. 
The fair value of the forward contract upon issuance was determined to be 
$
0
. Upon closing, the value of the forward contract was determined to be 
$
8,900
 and the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock was determined to be 
$
141,100
. The Convertible Preferred Stock was recorded at its fair value on the Issuance and the change in fair value of the forward contract was recorded as other income in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Issuance costs of 
$
2,250
 were incurred and recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the Convertible Preferred Stock in the year ended December 31, 2024.  
The Company classifies its Convertible Preferred Stock outside of stockholders’ equity as the redemption of such shares is outside the Company’s control. The Company did not adjust the carrying values of the Convertible Preferred Stock to redemption value as the shares are not probable of becoming redeemable as of December 31, 2024. 
The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights and privileges: 
Liquidation: 
The Series A Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary (“Liquidation”), each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive payment for the greater of (i) 
1.75
 multiplied by the sum of the Liquidation Preference (i.e., Initial Liquidation Preference of 
$
1,000
 per share plus Paid-in-Kind (“PIK”) Dividends) plus unpaid Regular Dividends (to the extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in such Liquidation Preference) or (ii) the amount such holder would have received if the Convertible Preferred Stock were fully converted to common stock. If the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to pay the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence, the assets will be distributed ratably to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
Voting:
Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to vote with the holders of common stock on each matter submitted for a vote on an as-converted basis, subject to the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock as specified in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations.
The holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall also have certain protective voting rights. Specifically, as long as the Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, each of the following events require at least a two thirds affirmative vote of the Convertible Preferred Stock holders: (a) any amendment or modification of the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized number of shares of, any class or series of Dividend Parity Stock, Liquidation Parity Stock, Dividend Senior Stock or Liquidation Senior Stock, (b) any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Certificate 
F-29

Table of Contents
of Designations that adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or powers of the Convertible Preferred Stock, (c) increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or issue additional shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, (d) the Company’s consolidation or combination with, or merger with or into, another Person, or any binding or statutory share exchange or involving the Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case unless: (i) the Convertible Preferred Stock either (x) remains outstanding after such consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange or reclassification; or (y) is converted or reclassified into, or is exchanged for, or represents solely the right to receive, preference securities of the continuing, resulting or surviving Person of such consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange or reclassification, or the parent thereof; (ii) the Convertible Preferred Stock that remains outstanding or such preference securities, as applicable, have rights, preferences and voting powers that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Holders or the holders thereof, as applicable, than the rights, preferences and voting powers, taken as a whole, of the Convertible Preferred Stock immediately before the consummation of such consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange or reclassification; and (iii) the issuer of the Convertible Preferred Stock that remains outstanding or such preference securities, as applicable, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia that, if not the Company, will succeed to the Company under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations and the Convertible Preferred Stock.
Redemption:
The Company has the right to redeem all Convertible Preferred Stock after the Redemption Trigger Date, which is the fifth anniversary of the Initial Issue Date of April 15, 2024. The amount payable on the redemption date is equal to the Liquidation Preference (i.e., Initial Liquidation Preference of 
$
1,000
 per share plus PIK Dividends) plus any unpaid Regular Dividends (to the extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in such Liquidation Preference).
If a change of control occurs, each holder shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all, or any whole number of shares that is less than all, of the holder’s Convertible Preferred Stock at an amount equal to 
1.75
 multiplied by the sum of the Liquidation Preference (i.e., Initial Liquidation Preference of 
$
1,000
 per share plus PIK Dividends) plus any unpaid Regular Dividends (to the extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in such Liquidation Preference).  As of December 31, 2024, the Company does not consider a change of control to be probable and therefore the Convertible Preferred Stock is not considered redeemable. 
Dividends:
After the second anniversary, dividends on the 
Convertible Preferred Stock
 accrue quarterly, at a 
6
%
 annual rate, and if not paid out in cash before the quarter end, will become PIK Dividends and added to the liquidation preference, or original issue price plus PIK Dividends.  Since dividends do not commence until the second anniversary of the Issuance, the 
Convertible Preferred Stock
 is considered increasing rate preferred stock.  Accordingly, the Company accretes the dividends, using the effective interest method, from Issuance to the first contractual call date, April 15, 2029.  The Company accrued dividends of 
$
3,970
 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a reduction to Additional Paid-In Capital and an increase to the carrying value of 
Convertible Preferred Stock.  
The carrying value of 
Convertible Preferred Stock
 as of December 31, 2024 is 
$
142,820
. 
Conversions: 
Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock

have the option to convert any number of whole shares at any time. The conversion is based on the sum of the Liquidation Preference plus unpaid Dividends divided by the $
48.00
 Conversion Price.  Given the Initial Liquidation Preference of 
$
1,000
, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock would be convertible into 
20.8333
 shares of common stock, prior to any adjustments such as PIK Dividends, unpaid Dividends, stock splits, or voluntary conversion rate increases. Upon conversion, cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional share of common stock. However, based on certain restrictions on the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock specified in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations, a holder of Convertible Preferred Stock is not entitled to effect a conversion of any portion of its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, or to vote in its capacity as a holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to matters submitted to holders of the common stock if, after giving effect to such conversion, that holder would beneficially own in excess of 
4.99
%, in the case of one holder, or 
9.99
%, in the case 
F-30

Table of Contents
of the other holder, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
​
On May 7, 2024, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock containing certain technical amendments to the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The amendments contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations (x) limited the voting rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock to 
24.9438
 shares of the Company’s common stock per $
1,000
 liquidation preference of Convertible Preferred Stock and (y) eliminated a 
1
% step up in the interest rate that otherwise would have applied in the unlikely event that the Company was required to obtain and failed to obtain stockholder approval for certain conversion shares underlying the Convertible Preferred Stock.
On July 10, 2024, the Company filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement to the prospectus included in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3ASR filed with the SEC on March 2, 2023, covering the resale from time to time by the Investors of up to an aggregate of 
3,124,995
 shares of common stock, to satisfy registration rights that the Company granted to such stockholders in connection with the Issuance.

10. Significant Agreements
License Agreements
RareStone
 Group Ltd.
In December 2021, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with RareStone Group Ltd., or the RareStone License. Pursuant to the RareStone License, we granted to RareStone an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit any pharmaceutical product that contains setmelanotide in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of conditions and diseases in humans in China, including mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. RareStone has a right of first negotiation in the event that the Company chooses to grant a license to develop or commercialize the licensed product in Taiwan. The arrangement includes a license and an additional performance obligation to supply product upon the request of RareStone.
​
According to the terms of the
 RareStone License
, 
RareStone
 has agreed to seek local approvals to commercialize IMCIVREE for the treatment of obesity and hyperphagia due to biallelic POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, as well as Bardet-Biedl and Alström syndromes. Additionally, 
RareStone
 has agreed to fund efforts to identify and enroll patients from China in the Company’s global EMANATE trial, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate setmelanotide in 
four
 independent sub-studies in patients with obesity due to a heterozygous variant of POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR; certain variants of the SRCI gene, and certain variants of the SH2B1 gene. In accordance with the terms of the 
RareStone License
, 
RareStone
 made an upfront payment to Rhythm of 
$
7,000
 and issued Rhythm 
1,077,586
 ordinary shares. The Company is eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones of up to 
$
62,500
, as well as tiered royalty payments on annual net sales of IMCIVREE. 
The Company initially estimated the fair value of the RareStone equity to be 
$
2,440
 based on a preliminary valuation during the first quarter of 2022.  Upon completion of the valuation procedures during the second quarter of 2022, the Company concluded the initial fair value of the RareStone equity to be 
$
1,040
.  During the third quarter of 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of the RareStone equity to be de minimis based upon the results of an updated valuation and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of 
$
1,040
 related to the decline in fair value as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The other-than-temporary impairment of 
$
1,040
 included the reclassification of a 
$
300
 unrealized loss previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity during the second quarter of 2022.  
The Company received total upfront consideration of 
$
8,040
 comprised of an upfront payment of 
$
7,000
, and the estimated fair value of the RareStone equity of 
$
1,040
. The Company determined that the RareStone License contains 
two

F-31

Table of Contents
performance obligations, the delivery of the license and the supply of clinical and commercial product. The Company further determined the supply of commercial product to RareStone contains a significant future discount and estimates the discount to be 
$
1,286
, which is recorded as a component of deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.
Based on a relative fair-value allocation between the license and the manufacture of clinical and commercial product, the 
Company recognized $
6,754
 of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2022.  
The discount related to commercial manufacturing supply will be deferred and recognized over the commercial supply period or upon termination of the agreement.

No
 license revenue was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2024.
On October 28, 2022, we delivered written notice, or the October 2022 Notice, to RareStone that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause. In accordance with the October 2022 Notice, we maintain that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License to fund, perform or seek certain key clinical studies and waivers, including with respect to our global EMANATE trial, among other obligations. On December 21, 2022, RareStone provided written notice to us that it objects to the claims in the October 2022 Notice, including our termination of the RareStone License for cause.  
On March 16, 2023, we provided written notice, or the March 2023 Notice, to RareStone reaffirming our position that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License and that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause, and also requested documentation supporting RareStone’s purported dispute notice objecting to the claims in the October 2022 Notice.  
On May 10, 2023, RareStone provided written notice to the Company reaffirming its objections to the claims in our October 2022 Notice and March 2023 Notice, including to the Company’s termination of the RareStone License for cause.  
On November 29, 2023, RareStone wrote to us seeking to negotiate and execute a commercial supply agreement as contemplated under the Exclusive License Agreement, and on January 19, 2024, we responded in writing again reaffirming our position that RareStone has materially breached its obligations under the RareStone License and that we have terminated the RareStone License for cause.  
Since our last written response in January 2024, we have engaged in discussions with RareStone in an effort to reach a resolution, however, we cannot predict whether a resolution will ever be reached.
Ipsen Pharma S.A.S.
Pursuant to our March 21, 2013 license agreement with Ipsen Pharma, S.A.S., or Ipsen, the Company has an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to research, develop, and commercialize compounds that were discovered or researched by Ipsen in the course of conducting its MC4R program or that otherwise were covered by the licensed patents. Under the terms of the setmelanotide Ipsen license agreement, assuming that setmelanotide is successfully developed, receives regulatory approval and is commercialized, Ipsen may receive aggregate payments of up to 
$
40,000
 upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones and royalties on future product sales in the mid-single digits. Substantially all of such aggregate payments of up to 
$
40,000
 are for milestones that may be achieved no earlier than first commercial sale of setmelanotide. In the event that the Company executes a sublicense agreement, it shall make payments to Ipsen, depending on the date of such sublicense agreement, ranging from 
10
%
 to 
20
%
 of all revenues actually received under such sublicense agreement.
The Company capitalized a 
$
5,000
 and 
$
4,000
 commercial milestone as a finite-lived intangible asset, as a result of the first commercial sales of IMCIVREE in the U.S. and Europe during March 2021 and March 2022, respectively.  There were 
no
 research and development expenses related to milestones recorded in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Camurus
In January 2016, the Company entered into a license agreement with Camurus AB, or Camurus, for the use of Camurus' drug delivery technology. The contract includes a non-refundable and non-creditable signing fee of $
500
. The Camurus agreement also includes up to $
7,750

F-32

Table of Contents
certain regulatory successes. The Company is also required to pay to Camurus, mid to mid-high single digit royalties, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis of annual net sales, until the later of (i) 
10 years
 after the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country; or (ii) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of all licensed patent rights in such country covering such product. The Company is also required to pay one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable sales milestones upon the achievement of certain sales levels for such product that cannot be in excess of $
57,000
.  The Company recorded development milestone expenses related to this license agreement of $
1,000
 during the year ended December 31, 2022. The expenses were recorded as research and development expenses when the milestone criteria were met in full during 2022.  There are 
no
 research and development expenses related to milestones recorded in 2023 or 2024.
11. Long-Term Obligations
On June 16, 2022, we entered into a RIFA with entities managed by HealthCare Royalty Management, LLC, collectively referred to as the Investors. Pursuant to the RIFA and subject to customary closing conditions, the Investors have agreed to pay the Company an aggregate investment amount of up to $
100,000
, or the Investment Amount. Under the terms of the RIFA, we received $
37,500
 on June 29, 2022 upon FDA approval of IMCIVREE in BBS, referred to as the Initial Investment Amount, and we received an additional $
37,500
 on September 29, 2022 of the Investment Amount upon EMA approval for BBS.  
On September 12, 2023, we received the remaining 
$
24,370
 of the Investment Amount, net of debt issuance costs, following the achievement of a specified amount of cumulative net sales of IMCIVREE between July 1, 2022 and September 30, 2023.
As consideration for the Investment Amount and pursuant to the RIFA, we agreed to pay the Investors a tiered royalty on our annual net revenues, or Revenue Interest, including worldwide net product sales and upfront payments and milestones. The applicable tiered percentage will initially be 
11.5
% on annual net revenues up to $
125,000
, 
7.5
% on annual net revenues of between $
125,000
 and $
300,000
 and 
2.5
% on annual net revenues exceeding $
300,000
. If the Investors have not received cumulative minimum payments equal to 
60
% of the amount funded by the Investors to date by March 31, 2027, or 
120
% of the amount funded by the Investors to date by March 31, 2029, we must make a cash payment immediately following each applicable date to the Investors sufficient to gross the Investors up to such minimum amounts after giving full consideration of the cumulative amounts paid by us to the Investors through each date, referred to as the Under Performance Payment.  As the repayment of the funded amount is contingent upon worldwide net product sales and upfront payments, milestones, and royalties, the repayment term may be shortened or extended depending on actual worldwide net product sales and upfront payments, milestones, and royalties.  As of December 31, 2024 we have made $
20,430
 of payments.  
The Investors’ rights to receive the Revenue Interests will terminate on the date on which the Investors have received payments equal to a certain percentage of the funded portion of the Investment Amount including the aggregate of all payments made to the Investors as of such date, each percentage tier referred to as the Hard Cap, unless the RIFA is earlier terminated. The total Revenue Interests payable by us to the Investors is capped between 
185
%
 and 
250
%
 of the Investment Amount paid, dependent on the aggregate royalty paid between 2028 and 2032. If a change of control of occurs, the Investors may accelerate payments due under the RIFA up to the Hard Cap plus any other obligations payable under the RIFA.
The repayment period commenced on July 8, 2022 for the Initial Investment Amount, and expires on the earlier of (i) the date at which the Investors received cash payments totaling an aggregate of a Hard Cap ranging from 
185
% to 
250
% of the Initial Investment Amount or (ii) the legal maturity date of July 8, 2034.  If the Investors have not received payments equal to 
250
% of the Investment Amount by the 
twelve-year
 anniversary of the initial closing date, we will be required to pay an amount equal to the Investment Amount plus a specific annual rate of return less payments previously received by Investors. In the event of a change of control, we are obligated to pay Investors an amount equal to the Hard Cap in effect at the time, ranging from 
185
% to 
250
% plus any Under Performance Payment of the Investment Amount less payments previously received by Investors. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, including, among others, our failure to pay any amounts due to Investors under the deferred royalty obligation, insolvency, our failure to pay indebtedness when due, the revocation of regulatory approval of IMCIVREE in the U.S. or our breach of any covenant contained in the RIFA and our failure to cure the breach within the prescribed time frame, we are obligated to pay Investors an amount equal to the Hard Cap in effect at the time of default ranging from 
185
% to 
250
% plus any Under Performance 
F-33

Table of Contents
Payment of the Investment Amount less payments previously received by Investors. In addition, upon an event of default, Investors may exercise all other rights and remedies available under the RIFA, including foreclosing on the collateral that was pledged to Investors, which consists of all of our present and future assets relating to IMCIVREE.
We have evaluated the terms of the RIFA and concluded that the features are similar to those of a debt instrument. Accordingly, we have accounted for the transaction as long-term debt and presented it as a deferred royalty obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We have further evaluated the terms of the RIFA and determined that the repayment of the Hard Cap in effect at the time which ranges from 
185
% to 
250
% of the Investment Amount, less any payments made to date, upon a change of control is an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation from the debt instrument and fair value recognition. We determined the fair value of the derivative using an option pricing Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the probability of change of control occurring and potential repayment amounts and timing of such payments that would result under various scenarios, as further described in Note 5, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company recorded $
1,590
 for the initial fair value of the embedded derivative liability (asset).  The fair value of the embedded derivative liability (asset) was ($
270
) and $
1,150
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We will remeasure the embedded derivative to fair value each reporting period until the time the features lapse and/or termination of the deferred royalty obligation. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized other income of $
1,420
 and $
190
, due to the remeasurement of the embedded derivative liability. The carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation at December 31, 2024 was $
109,810
 based on $
100,000
 of proceeds, net of the initial fair value of the bifurcated embedded derivative liability upon execution of the RIFA, and debt issuance costs incurred. The carrying value is classified as $
1,541
 within current liabilities and $
108,269
 within long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation approximated fair value at December 31, 2024. The effective interest rate as of December 31, 2024 was 
16.02
%. In connection with the deferred royalty obligation, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $
3,287
. Debt issuance costs have been netted against the debt and are being amortized over the estimated term of the debt using the effective interest method, adjusted on a prospective basis for changes in the underlying assumptions and inputs. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the debt and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the classification of these costs, as well as the period over which these costs will be amortized.
12. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company, from time to time, may be party to various litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not presently subject to any pending or threatened litigation that it believes, if determined adversely to the Company, individually, or taken together, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business or financial results.
Other
The Company is party to various agreements, principally relating to licensed technology, that require future payments relating to milestones that may be met in subsequent periods, or royalties on future sales of specified products.  See Note 10 for discussion of these arrangements.  Additionally, the Company is party to various contracts with CROs and CMOs that generally provide for termination on notice, with the exact amounts in the event of termination to be based on the timing of the termination and the terms of the agreement.
Based  on  the Company’s  current  development  plans as of December 31, 2024, the Company does not expect to make milestone payments due to third parties during  the  next  12  months  from  the  filing  of  this  Annual  Report on  Form 10-K, in connection with our license agreements. These milestones generally become  due  and  payable  upon achievement of such milestones or sales and achievement of development milestones.  When the  achievement  of  these  milestones or sales have not occurred, such contingencies are not recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, because the Company's management has determined that is it more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. The increase in the valuation allowance of $
58,344
 in 2024 and $
49,901
 in 2023 primarily relates to the net loss incurred by the Company during each period.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
610,234
 and $
694,029
, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times beginning in 2033 for federal and state purposes.  Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2024, $
537,214
 can be carried forward indefinitely.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
2,566
 which have an indefinite carryforward period.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state research tax credits of approximately $
13,802
 and $
4,812
, respectively, which may be used to offset future tax liabilities. Additionally, as of 2024, the Company had a federal orphan drug credit related to qualifying research of $
34,603
. These tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire at various times beginning in 2033 for federal purposes and 2028 for state purposes.
The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions and other provisions within the Internal Revenue Code. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.    
The Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
250
 as such amounts are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in these jurisdictions. The accumulated earnings in the foreign subsidiaries are primarily utilized to fund working capital

requirements as its subsidiaries continue to expand their operations. The amount of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings is immaterial.
The Company has not recorded any reserves for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of research and development credit carryforwards. This study may result in an adjustment to the Company's research and development credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company's research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. Thus, there would be no impact to the balance sheets or statements of operations and comprehensive loss if an adjustment were required.  
Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits will be classified as provision for income taxes in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company is subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income tax authorities for tax years 2013 forward. The Company is not currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdictions for any tax years.
15.  Segment and Geographic Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company currently operates in 
two
 business segments, which are U.S. and international segments for the development and commercialization of therapies for patients with rare diseases. A single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer comprehensively manages the entire business. The Company meets the aggregation criteria of ASC 280 and therefore has 
one
 reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024.  
The table below is a summary of the segment profit or loss, including significant segment expenses (in thousands):
