GENERAL OVERVIEW
Old National is the sixth largest commercial bank headquartered in the Midwest by asset size and ranks among the top 30 banking companies headquartered in the United States. The Company’s corporate headquarters and principal executive office are located in Evansville, Indiana with commercial and consumer banking operations headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Through our wholly owned banking subsidiary and non-bank affiliates, we provide a wide range of services primarily throughout the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. In addition to providing extensive services in consumer and commercial banking, Old National offers comprehensive wealth management and capital markets services.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2024
In 2024, Old National successfully navigated a challenging interest rate environment while remaining on offense with our growth strategy, investing in client-facing and key support talent, and remaining opportunistic for new acquisitions. Our peer-leading deposit franchise, disciplined loan growth, strong credit quality, well-managed expenses, and dedicated team members who are committed to our clients and communities enabled us to exceed our expectations that we set as we began 2024. Highlights experienced in 2024 included:
•
net income applicable to common shareholders of $523.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted common share;
•
granular, low-cost deposit franchise; loan to deposit ratio of 89%;
•
growth in total deposits of 10%;
•
disciplined loan growth of 10%;
•
well-managed expenses; and
•
stable credit metrics, including net charge-offs to average loans of 0.17%.
Results for 2024 were impacted by $37.3 million of merger-related expenses, $15.3 million of CECL Day 1 non-PCD provision expense related to the allowance for credit losses established on acquired non-PCD loans, a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest plan, $3.0 million for the FDIC special assessment, $2.6 million of separation expense, and $0.2 million of net securities losses. Excluding these items, net income applicable to common shares for 2024 
37
was $578.1 million, or $1.86 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for reconciliations to GAAP financial measures.
Our net interest income increased 2% to $1.5 billion during 2024, driven by loans and securities acquired in the CapStar transaction as well as strong loan growth and the interest rate environment. Provision for credit losses increased compared to 2023, reflective of provision expense associated with the CapStar merger as well as loan growth, credit migration, net charge-offs, and macroeconomic factors. Noninterest income increased from $333.3 million in 2023 to $354.7 million in 2024 primarily due to the impact of the CapStar merger, higher wealth and investment services fees, mortgage banking revenues, and other income, partially offset by a gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares totaling $21.6 million in 2023. Noninterest expense increased $68.1 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Noninterest expense in 2024 included $37.3 million of merger-related expenses, a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest plan, $3.0 million for the FDIC special assessment, and $2.6 million of separation expense. Noninterest expense in 2023 included $28.7 million of merger-related expenses, a $19.1 million FDIC special assessment, $4.4 million of a contract termination charge, $3.4 million of expenses related to the Louisville tragedy, and $1.6 million for property optimization. Excluding these expenses, noninterest expense in 2024 increased $68.9 million, reflective of the additional operating costs associated with the impact of the CapStar merger, as well as higher salary and employee benefits reflective of merit increases.
On April 1, 2024, Old National completed its acquisition of CapStar, strengthening our presence in Nashville and other high-growth Southeastern markets. All system conversions related to the CapStar transaction were completed in early July 2024. Later in 2024, we announced our pending partnership with Bremer Bank; the definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Bremer and Old National. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the approval of Bremer shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the middle of 2025.
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
We enter 2025 building on the strong foundation we established in 2024 as we successfully navigated a challenging interest rate environment while remaining on offense with our growth strategy, investing in key talent, and remaining opportunistic for new partnerships. Our basic banking strategy continues to serve us well, with a focus on low-cost core deposits, which grew by approximately 10% in 2024, funding a corresponding 10% growth in loans. We continue to focus on full client relationships that align with our risk-adjusted return requirements, and our credit quality remains strong as we continue to adhere to our disciplined underwriting process. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced our partnership with Bremer Bank, which is headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota and which will enhance our presence in the upper Midwest across Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, expand our opportunities to acquire new clients and build on existing relationships within this footprint.
We are confident in our ability to navigate changes in short-term interest rates, shifts in the yield curve, and overall economic conditions as we have for the past 190 years. We will remain on offense and continue to demonstrate our ability to execute on our strategic priorities. We remain focused on the fundamentals of basic banking, including loan and deposit growth, expansion of revenue-generating businesses, strong credit quality, prudent capital deployment, and disciplined expense management within a sound risk management framework to produce positive operating leverage, which allows us to continue to create value for our shareholders and communities.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company’s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist users of the financial information in assessing the Company’s operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the following table. 
The Company presents net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares, adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, debt securities gains/losses, separation expense, CECL Day 1 non-PCD provision expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special assessment expense, gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville location (“Louisville expenses”), contract termination charge, and property optimization charges. Management believes excluding these items from net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes.
The taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. 
In management’s view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as users of the financial information, in assessing the Company’s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution’s capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retain the effect of AOCI in shareholders’ equity.
Although intended to enhance understanding of the Company’s business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 81% of 2024 revenues. Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
The Federal Reserve decreased its interest rates during 2024. The Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds range is currently in a target range of 4.25% to 4.50%, with the Effective Federal Funds Rate at 4.33% at December 31, 2024, and 5.33% at December 31, 2023. Management actively takes balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate interest rate risk. See the section of this Item 7 titled “Market Risk” for additional information regarding this risk.
Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and net interest margin.
Net interest income is the excess of interest received from interest-earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the current federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes for both management and investors.

(1)    The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances.
(2)    Interest on investment securities includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $11.1 million in 2024, $11.5 million in 2023, and $11.5 million in 2022; using the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21%.
(3)    Interest on loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $13.4 million in 2024, $11.9 million in 2023, and $6.9 million, in 2022; using the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21%.
Net interest income in 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to loans and securities acquired in the CapStar transaction as well as strong loan growth, higher rates on loans and investment securities, and higher accretion income, partially offset by higher balances and costs of average interest-bearing liabilities. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled $50.8 million in 2024, compared to $28.3 million in 2023.
The decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis in 2024 when compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher balances and costs of average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by loan growth as well as higher yields on loans. The yield on average earning assets increased 41 basis points from 5.18% in 2023 to 5.59% in 2024 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 73 basis points from 2.25% in 2023 to 2.98% in 2024. Average earning assets increased by $3.9 billion, or 9%, primarily due to a $3.3 billion increase in average loans. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.6 billion, or 15%, reflecting a $5.0 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a reduction in average borrowed funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by $1.2 billion.
The increase in average earning assets in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to loans and securities acquired in the CapStar transaction as well as strong loan growth. The loan portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio, was 76% of average interest earning assets in 2024, compared to 75% in 2023.
46
Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $3.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to loans acquired in the CapStar transaction as well as strong commercial real estate loan growth. Loans acquired in the CapStar transaction totaled $2.1 billion at transaction close.
Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 while average interest-bearing deposits increased $5.0 billion reflecting a mix shift as a result of the current rate environment, deposits assumed in the CapStar transaction, and organic growth. Total deposit growth in 2024 has allowed us to organically fund loan growth. Deposits assumed in the CapStar transaction totaled $2.6 billion at the close of the transaction.

Total provision for credit losses increased $51.7 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to loan growth, credit migration, net charge-offs, and macroeconomic factors. In addition, the provision for credit losses on loans in 2024 included $15.3 million to establish an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans acquired in the CapStar transaction. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. For additional information about non-performing loans, charge-offs, and additional items impacting the provision, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk” section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Noninterest Income
We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. This source of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 19% in 2024 compared to 18% in 2023.

Noninterest income increased $21.4 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Noninterest income in 2023 was impacted by a gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares totaling $21.6 million as well as $6.3 million of net losses on sales of debt securities. Excluding these items, noninterest income grew $36.9 million primarily due to the acquisition of CapStar, higher wealth and investment services fees, mortgage banking revenue, and other income.
Wealth and investment services fees increased $9.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher wealth management fees as a result of continued sales to new and existing customers as well as favorable market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of CapStar.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $9.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher mortgage originations and increased loan sales.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a $21.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares in noninterest income. Prior to the sale, the shares were carried at zero cost basis due to uncertainty surrounding the ability of the Company to transfer or otherwise liquidate the shares. After the sale, the Company did not hold any remaining Visa Class B restricted shares. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the Visa Class B restricted shares.
Other income increased $9.1 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to additional other income associated with the acquisition of CapStar, discrete items in 2024, and higher commercial loan fees.

Noninterest expense increased $68.1 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Noninterest expense in 2024 included $37.3 million of merger-related expenses, a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest plan, $3.0 million for the FDIC special assessment, and $2.6 million of separation expense. Noninterest expense in 2023 included $28.7 million of merger-related expenses, a $19.1 million FDIC special assessment, $4.4 million of a contract termination charge, $3.4 million of expenses related to the Louisville tragedy, and $1.6 million for property optimization. Excluding these expenses, noninterest expense in 2024 increased $68.9 million, reflective of the additional operating costs associated with the acquisition of CapStar, as well as higher salary and employee benefits reflective of merit increases.
FDIC assessment expense decreased $12.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to FDIC special assessments totaling $3.0 million and $19.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset by higher assessment rates and deposit balances. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes special assessments to recover the losses to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in connection with the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately $16.3 billion. The rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted, which will affect the amount of the special assessment. Under the rule, the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an IDI reported in its December 31, 2022 Call Report, excluding the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points per year (3.36 basis points per quarter) over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024. Because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis. In its December 31, 2022 Call Report, Old National Bank reported estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $12.0 billion. The total of the special assessments for Old National Bank was estimated at $19.1 million, and such amount was recorded as an expense in the year ended December 31, 2023. Old National recorded an additional $3.0 million within FDIC assessment expense for this special assessment in the year ended December 31, 2024.
Provision for Income Taxes
We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The effective tax rate was 20.8% in 2024 compared to 22.5% in 2023. The lower 
49
effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023 reflected decreases in pre-tax book income and state income taxes combined with increases in tax credits and tax-exempt income. The decrease in state income taxes reflected the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on Old National’s income tax provision.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Overview
At December 31, 2024, our assets were $53.6 billion, a $4.5 billion increase compared to $49.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as disciplined loan growth.
Earning Assets
Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, money market investments, interest-earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $48.0 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $4.1 billion compared to earning assets of $43.9 billion at December 31, 2023.
Investment Securities
We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements.
The investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $10.9 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar. Investment securities represented 23% of earning assets at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.
The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of $890.5 million and $869.5 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The investment securities held-to-maturity portfolio had net unrealized losses of $483.7 million and $412.3 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio including securities hedges had an effective duration of 4.11 at December 31, 2024, compared to 4.24 at December 31, 2023. The total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.09 at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.35 at December 31, 2023. Effective duration represents the percentage change in the fair value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates and is used to evaluate the portfolio’s price volatility at a single point in time. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The weighted average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 3.57% in 2024 and 3.18% in 2023.
Loan Portfolio
We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture, among others. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size.

Geographic location in the preceding table is determined by collateral location for real estate loans and borrower location for non-real estate loans.
Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans
Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 55% at December 31, 2024, compared to 54% at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, commercial and commercial real estate loans were $26.6 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as disciplined loan production that was well balanced across our market footprint and product lines.

53
The mix of properties securing the loans in our commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the Company’s primary market area. Approximately 27% of the commercial real estate portfolio is owner-occupied as of December 31, 2024, compared to 25% at December 31, 2023.
The Company actively reviews its broader loan portfolio in the normal course of business and has performed a targeted review of contractual maturities in its non-owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio as part of its response to current market conditions to identify exposure to credit risk associated with renewals. At December 31, 2024, the Company held $459.6 million of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate, or 1% of total loans, that mature within 18 months with an interest rate below 4%.
Residential Real Estate Loans
Residential real estate loans held in our portfolio increased $98.1 million to $6.8 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as organic growth. Changes in interest rates may impact the number of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. If interest rates decrease in the future, there may be an increase in refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. Conversely, future increases in interest rates may result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans.
Consumer Loans
Consumer loans, including automobile loans, personal, and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased $252.6 million to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as organic growth.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Loan Commitments
At December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $392.5 million, compared to $307.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as organic loan growth and other factors. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance.
We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $21.7 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $31.2 million at December 31, 2023.
Additional information about our Allowance for Credit Losses is included in the “Risk Management – Credit Risk” section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2024 totaled $2.3 billion, an increase of $195.1 million compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded with the acquisition of CapStar.
Other Assets
Other assets at December 31, 2024 increased $175.8 million compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher alternative investments.

The increase in total deposits was primarily due to deposits assumed in the CapStar transaction as well as organic growth. We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 12% at December 31, 2024, compared to 13% at December 31, 2023. See Notes 11, 12, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our financing activities.

Capital
Shareholders’ equity totaled $6.3 billion, or 12% of total assets, at December 31, 2024 and $5.6 billion, or 11% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Old National issued 24.0 million shares of Common Stock in conjunction with the acquisition of CapStar on April 1, 2024 adding $417.6 million in shareholders’ equity. Retained earnings were partially offset by dividends during 2024. Old National’s Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “ONB” with 62,288 shareholders of record at December 31, 2024.
Capital Adequacy
Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Management routinely analyzes Old National’s capital to ensure an optimized capital 
55
structure. Accordingly, such evaluations may result in Old National taking a capital action. For additional information on capital adequacy see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Management views stress testing as an integral part of the Company’s risk management and strategic planning activities. Old National performs stress testing periodically throughout the year. The primary objective of the stress test is to ensure that Old National has a robust, forward-looking stress testing process and maintains sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Management also uses the stress testing framework to evaluate decisions relating to pricing, loan concentrations, capital deployment, and mergers and acquisitions to ensure that strategic decisions align with Old National’s risk appetite statement. Old National’s stress testing process incorporates key risks that include strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, compliance, legal, and reputational risks. Old National’s stress testing policy outlines steps that will be taken if stress test results do not meet internal thresholds under severely adverse economic scenarios.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Overview
Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable our Board of Directors, Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board, Executive Leadership Team, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, monitor, and mitigate Old National’s risks. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, talent management, compliance and regulatory, legal, and reputational. Our Chief Risk Officer provides quarterly reports to the Board’s Enterprise Risk Committee on various risk topics. The following discussion addresses certain of these major risks including credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and regulatory, and legal. Discussion of strategic, talent management, and reputational risks is provided in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities.
Investment Activities
All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. government-sponsored or federal agencies. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio.
Counterparty Exposure
Counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation. We define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased, repurchase agreements, correspondent bank relationships, and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry. Old National manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least “A” by Standard & Poor’s Rating Service or “A2” by Moody’s Investors Service. There are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. Total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent. Old National’s net counterparty exposure was an asset of $28.5 million at December 31, 2024.
Lending Activities
Commercial
Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, borrower expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant’s financial 
56
condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness.
Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic Midwest and Southeast market areas we serve. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at LTV margins deemed appropriate for the property type, quality, location, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 80%, although higher levels may be permitted with additional non-real estate collateral, increased guaranties, accelerated amortization, or other mitigating factors. The commercial properties are predominantly multi-family and non-residential properties such as retail centers, industrial properties as well as, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.
In the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flows to the loan’s debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal(s) of the borrower. In most cases, we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required.
Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements.
Consumer
We offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets, with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category. These loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. A maximum LTV ratio of 90% is generally required, although higher levels may be permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors. We offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime loans, or any product with negative amortization.
Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation.
Automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans, with us listed as loss payee. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant’s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant’s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount.
Asset Quality
Community-based lending personnel, along with region-based independent underwriting and analytic support staff, extend credit under guidelines established and administered by management and overseen by our Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, which meets quarterly, is made up of independent outside directors. The committee monitors credit quality through its general review of information such as delinquencies, credit exposures, peer comparisons, problem loans, and charge-offs. In addition, the committee provides oversight of loan policy changes 
57
as recommended by management with the objective of maintaining an appropriate lending policy for the current lending environment.
We  lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including, among others, real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size. At December 31, 2024, our average commercial loan size was approximately $716,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately $1,567,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At December 31, 2024, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States.

Under-performing assets increased to $456.3 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $285.2 million at December 31, 2023. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans were 1.26% at December 31, 2024, compared to 0.86% at December 31, 2023.
Nonaccrual loans increased $173.2 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 including $71.7 million of nonaccrual loans acquired in the CapStar acquisition. Excluding these loans, nonaccrual loans increased $101.5 million reflecting the migration of certain borrowers primarily due to asset quality rating policy changes and the impact of the higher interest rate environment. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 87.62% at December 31, 2024, compared to 111.93% at December 31, 2023.
If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms, interest income of approximately $20.4 million in 2024 and $13.4 million in 2023 would have been recorded on these loans. The amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans was $12.1 million in 2024 and $5.0 million in 2023.
Total criticized and classified assets were $2.5 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $725.0 million from December 31, 2023 including $222.1 million of criticized and classified loans related to the CapStar acquisition. Excluding these loans, total criticized and classified assets increased $503.0 million reflecting the migration of certain borrowers primarily due to asset quality rating policy changes and the impact of the higher interest rate environment. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $59.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $48.9 million at December 31, 2023.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Loan Commitments
Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company’s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures (unfunded loan commitments) is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.
The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods.
The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics.
59
The loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures. The four loan portfolios used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields – commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer – are reclassified into seven segments of loans – commercial, commercial real estate, BBCC, residential real estate, indirect, direct, and home equity for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses on loans. The commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC portfolio segments. The consumer loan category shown on the balance sheet is comprised of the same loans in the indirect, direct, and home equity portfolio segments. The portfolio segment reclassifications follow:

The allowance for credit losses on loans was $392.5 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $307.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of CapStar, as well as organic loan growth and other factors. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance.

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $21.7 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $31.2 million at December 31, 2023.
See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit risk.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes.
The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, client preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.
In managing interest rate risk, we establish guidelines for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates, which are reviewed with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including:
•
adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities;
•
changing product pricing strategies;
•
modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or
•
using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree.
A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on Old National’s results of operations. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario over a two-year cumulative horizon resulting from an immediate change in interest rates using multiple rate scenarios. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. Due to the dynamics of future interest 
63
rate expectations, we also measure and monitor interest rate risk using the forward curve, which may be a more probable scenario of our interest rate exposure. The forward curve represents the relationship between the price of forward contracts and the time to maturity of the forward contracts at a point in time.
The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two-year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Our projected net interest income increased year over year driven by loan growth and asset repricing due to current interest rates and economic conditions. Our overall strategy is consistent period over period, as we continue to manage our balance sheet toward a neutral interest rate risk position in a disciplined manner.
A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which align with our approach to deposit pricing and are consistent period over period. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested.
We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of $7.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of $4.5 million at December 31, 2023. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. We establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and monitor through our Asset/Liability Executive Management Committee. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, to properly manage capital markets’ funding sources, and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On May 31, 2023, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities.
Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates, events at other banking organizations, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments.

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2024, Old National Bancorp’s other borrowings outstanding were $329.7 million. Management believes the Company has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short-term and the long-term.
Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Old National Bank to Old National Bancorp on an unconsolidated basis without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2023 or 2024 and is not currently required. At December 31, 2024, Old National Bank could pay dividends of $889.2 million without 
66
prior regulatory approval and while maintaining capital levels above regulatory minimum and well-capitalized guidelines.
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk that inadequate information systems, operational issues, breaches in internal controls, information security breaches, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses and other adverse impacts to Old National, such as reputational harm. We maintain frameworks, programs, and internal controls to prevent or minimize financial loss from failure of systems, people, or processes. This includes specific programs and frameworks intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks or other information security breaches that might allow unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to client, team member, or company sensitive information. Metrics and measurements are used by our management team in the management of day-to-day operations to ensure effective client service, minimization of service disruptions, and oversight of cybersecurity risk. We continually monitor and internally report on weaknesses in the internal control environment; third party risks; privacy and data governance; cyber-attacks; information security or data breaches; damage to physical assets; employee and workplace safety; execution, delivery, and process management; external and internal fraud; model risk management; and other risks.
Compliance and Regulatory Risk
Compliance and regulatory risk is the risk that the Company violated or was not in compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, regulatory guidance and policies, industry standards, or ethical standards. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards is not only the right thing to do, but it is embedded within our culture and mission to assist our clients in achieving financial success. Adherence to this belief is the responsibility of every employee, every day, in everything we do. It is Old National’s policy to comply with the letter and intent of all applicable regulatory requirements. Management, the first line of defense, is responsible for ensuring this expectation is met, with oversight from the second and third lines of defense, the risk and internal audit functions, respectively. Recognizing that inadvertent violations may occur, risk management activities are established to promptly identify, analyze, and, if necessary, remediate compliance and regulatory issues to limit compliance risk exposure.
Legal Risk
Legal risk generally results from unidentified or unmitigated risks that could result in lawsuits or adverse judgments that negatively affect the operations or financial condition of the Company. Business practices must be executed, as well as products and services delivered, in a manner that is compliant with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and agreements to which we are a party. Corporate governance practices must be compliant with applicable legal requirements and aligned with market practices. The Board of Directors expects that we will perform business in a manner compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations and expects issues to be identified, analyzed, and remediated in a timely and complete manner.

We are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates, to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity, and to provide derivative contracts to our clients. Since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently 
67
and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the normal course of business, various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged. Further discussion of contingent liabilities is included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition, liabilities recorded under FASB ASC 740-10 (FASB Interpretation No. 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
) are not included in the table because the amount and timing of any cash payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Further discussion of income taxes and liabilities is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience, future forecasts, or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
•
Description. 
For mergers and acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as core deposit and customer trust relationship intangibles, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. The difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the merger or acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the merger or acquisition. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations. 
The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill.
•
Judgments and Uncertainties.
 The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management’s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values. Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the merger or acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger or acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and often involves a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, and certain other assets and liabilities.
•
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions.
 Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets, 
68
including goodwill and liabilities, which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
•
Description. 
The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.
The allowance for credit losses on loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted by an expense for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.
•
Judgments and Uncertainties. 
We utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans. Expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield method. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as an allowance. Expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules, calculated PDs, LGD and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors. For commercial and commercial real estate loans, the PD is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon. For residential and consumer loans, the PD is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being charged-off within the time horizon. The regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, home price index, and the BBB ratio. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts.
•
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions.
 The allowance represents management’s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations.
One of the most significant judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses is the macroeconomic forecast provided by a third party. The economic indices sourced from the macroeconomic forecast and used in projecting loss rates include the national unemployment rate, changes in home price index, changes in the United States gross domestic product, and changes in the BBB ratio. The economic index used in the calculation to which the calculation may be most sensitive is the national unemployment rate. Each reporting period, several macroeconomic forecast scenarios are considered by management. Management selects the macroeconomic forecast that is most reflective of expectations at that point in time. Changes in the macroeconomic forecast, especially for the national unemployment rate, could significantly impact the calculated estimated credit losses.
The expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses on loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors.
Derivative Financial Instruments
•
Description. 
As part of our overall interest rate risk management, we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the 
69
derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements. All of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained. We are not using the “short-cut” method of accounting for any fair value derivatives.
Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Old National’s exposure is limited to the termination value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal, or contract amounts. There are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, we minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.
•
Judgments and Uncertainties.
 The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items.
•
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions.
 To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). However, if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income, resulting in greater volatility in our earnings.
Income Taxes
•
Description. 
We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly; and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. FASB ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities.
•
Judgments and Uncertainties.
 In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit.
•
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. 
Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include some amounts which are estimates based upon currently available information and management’s judgment of current conditions and circumstances. Financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which is believed to provide, in all material respects, reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized and recorded, and the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. In addition, Old National has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a Senior Financial and Executive Officer Code of Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines that outline high levels of ethical business standards.
In order to monitor compliance with this system of controls, Old National maintains an extensive internal audit program. Internal audit reports are issued to appropriate officers and significant audit exceptions, if any, are reviewed with management and the Audit Committee.
The Board of Directors, through an Audit Committee comprised solely of independent directors, oversees management’s discharge of its financial reporting responsibilities. The Audit Committee meets regularly with Old National’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, and managers responsible for financial reporting. During these meetings, the committee meets privately with the independent registered public accounting firm as well as with financial reporting and internal audit personnel to review accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is made by the Audit Committee.
Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Old National is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Old National’s management assessed the effectiveness of Old National’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
. Based on that assessment, Old National has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, Old National’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Old National’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of Old National’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Old National Bancorp
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Old National Bancorp and subsidiaries (“Old National") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Old National as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Old National’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on Old National's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Old National’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Old National’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Old National in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (“ACL”) — Qualitative Factors — Refer to Note 1 and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Critical Audit Matter Description
Old National maintains the ACL as an estimate of expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of their loan portfolio. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics.  
73
Old National utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) approach with a probability of default (“PD”) methodology for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The PD regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts. The loss given default (“LGD”) is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults.
Expected cash flows are created for each loan using reasonable and supportable forecasts and discounted using the loan’s effective yield. The discounted sum of expected cash flows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as a component of the ACL. The quantitative allowance is adjusted by qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts.  
At December 31, 2024, the key qualitative adjustments to the expected credit losses are associated with risks in the forecasted economic environment. These factors include the risk that macroeconomic forecasts of unemployment, gross domestic product, and the BBB ratio (BBB spread to the 10-Year U.S. Treasury rate) may prove to be more severe and/or prolonged than the baseline forecast due to a variety of considerations.
Considering the estimation and judgment in determining adjustments for such qualitative factors, our audit of the ACL and the related disclosures involved subjective judgment about the qualitative adjustments to the ACL.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the qualitative adjustments to the ACL included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of Old National’s controls over the qualitative adjustments to the ACL
•
We assessed the reasonableness of, and evaluated support for, key qualitative adjustments 
•
We tested the completeness and accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the key data used as inputs to the qualitative adjustment estimation process, including:
◦
Portfolio segment loan balances and other borrower-specific data
◦
Relevant macroeconomic indicators and data
•
With the assistance of our credit specialists, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the ACL models used as the method for developing the qualitative adjustments

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 of Old National Bancorp (the “Company”) and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ Crowe LLP
We served as the Company's auditor from 2005, which is the year the engagement letter was signed for the audit of the 2006 financial statements, through the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed in February 2023.

OLD NATIONAL BANCORP
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Old National Bancorp, the financial holding company of Old National Bank, our wholly owned banking subsidiary, is headquartered in Evansville, Indiana with commercial and consumer banking operations headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Through Old National Bank and non-bank affiliates, Old National Bancorp provides a wide range of services to its clients throughout the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States and elsewhere, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, private banking, capital markets, brokerage, wealth management, trust, investment advisory, and other traditional banking services.
NOTE 1 – 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Old National Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Old National”) and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry. Such principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or shareholders’ equity and were insignificant amounts.
Equity Securities
Equity securities consist of mutual funds for Community Reinvestment Act qualified investments and diversified investment securities held in a grantor trust for participants in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other income.
Investment Securities
Old National classifies debt investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity on the date of purchase. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses affect income and the prior fair value adjustments are reclassified within shareholders’ equity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized on the level-yield method. Anticipated prepayments are considered when amortizing premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities are determined using the specific-identification method.
Available-for-sale securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if a decline in fair value should be recorded through income or other comprehensive income (loss). For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale securities that do not meet the criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any decline in fair value that has not been recorded 
81
through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. Accrued interest receivable on the securities portfolio is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.
Federal Home Loan Bank/Federal Reserve Bank Stock
Old National is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system and its regional Federal Reserve Bank. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors. FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
Loans Held-for-Sale
Loans that Old National has originated with an intent to sell are classified as loans held-for-sale and are recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet date. The loan’s fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest. Conventional mortgage production is sold with servicing rights retained. Certain loans, such as government guaranteed mortgage loans are sold on servicing released basis.
Loans
Loans that Old National intends to hold are classified as held for investment. Loans held for investment are carried at the principal balance outstanding, net of earned interest, purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the principal balances of loans outstanding. For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued but not received is reversed against earnings. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured.
Old National has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Evidence of credit deterioration was evaluated using various indicators, such as past due and nonaccrual status, as well as asset quality rating (“AQR”). Purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and initial allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is accreted or amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses. 
Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a financial difficulty modification has occurred, which is when Old National modifies a loan related to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date, a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay. The adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 eliminated the recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and enhanced disclosures for modifications to loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company’s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures (unfunded loan commitments) is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is 
82
adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.
The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods.
The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics.
We utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans. Expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield method. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as an allowance. Expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules, calculated probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”), and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors. For commercial and commercial real estate loans, the PD is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon. For residential and consumer loans, the PD is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being charged-off within the time horizon. The regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and home price index. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts.
Further information regarding Old National’s policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on loans is presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is stated at cost. Depreciation is charged to operating expense over the useful lives of the assets, principally on the straight-line method. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 
10
 to 
39
 years; and furniture and equipment – 
3
 to 
7
 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized. Interest costs on construction of qualifying assets are capitalized.
Premises and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are adjusted to fair value. Such impairments are included in other expense.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill arises from business combinations and is determined as the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed as of the merger or acquisition date. Amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets is not recorded. However, the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. Other intangible assets, including core deposits and customer 
83
business relationships, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, generally over a period of 
5
 to 
15
 years.
Company-Owned Life Insurance
Old National has purchased, as well as obtained through mergers and acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain key executives. Old National records company-owned life insurance at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
Loan Servicing Rights
When loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gain on sales of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Loan servicing rights are included in other assets on the balance sheet.
Loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, term, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If Old National later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with mortgage banking revenue on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement as mortgage banking revenue, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned.
Derivative Financial Instruments
As part of Old National’s overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors. All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. At the inception of the derivative contract, Old National designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value hedge”), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”), or (3) an instrument with no hedging designation (“stand-alone derivative”). For a fair value hedge, the change in value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting change in value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings, in noninterest income.
Net cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income. Cash flows on hedges are classified in the cash flow statement the same as the cash flows of the items being hedged.
Old National formally documents all relationships between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This documentation includes linking fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Old National also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Old National discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that (1) the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, or terminated; (3) the derivative instrument is de-
84
designated as a hedge because the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring; (4) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or (5) management otherwise determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the asset or liability. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transaction is still expected to occur, changes in value that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized or accreted into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.
Old National enters into various stand-alone mortgage-banking derivatives in order to hedge the risk associated with the fluctuation of interest rates. Changes in fair value are recorded as mortgage banking revenue. Old National also enters into various stand-alone derivative contracts to provide derivative products to clients, which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as other noninterest income.
Old National is exposed to losses if a counterparty fails to make its payments under a contract in which Old National is in the net receiving position. Old National anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. In addition, Old National obtains collateral above certain thresholds of the fair value of its hedges for each counterparty based upon their credit standing. All of the contracts to which Old National is a party settle monthly, quarterly, or semiannually. Further, Old National has netting agreements with the dealers with which it does business.
Credit-Related Financial Instruments
In the ordinary course of business, Old National’s bank subsidiary has entered into credit-related financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The notional amount of these commitments is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements until they are funded. Old National maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and is adjusted as a provision for unfunded loan commitments included in the provision for credit losses.
Repossessed Collateral
Other real estate owned and repossessed personal property are initially recorded at the fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell and are included in other assets on the balance sheet. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through the completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Any excess recorded investment over the fair value of the property received is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded in noninterest expense, as are the costs of operating the properties. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale.
Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
We purchase certain securities, generally U.S. government-sponsored entity and agency securities, under agreements to resell. The amounts advanced under these agreements represent short-term secured loans and are reflected as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase. These agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions. These secured borrowings are reflected as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. Short-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within 
one
 to 
four days
 from the transaction date. Securities, generally U.S. government and federal agency securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements can be repledged by the secured party. Additional collateral may be required based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
85
Share-Based Compensation
Compensation cost is recognized for stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock awards and units issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and appreciation rights, while the market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. The market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the performance period is used for restricted stock units where the performance measure is based on an internal performance measure. A third-party provider is used to value certain restricted stock units where the performance measure is based on total shareholder return. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
FDIC Special Assessment
On November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) finalized a rule that imposes special assessments to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) resulting from the FDIC’s use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in connection with the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately $16.3 billion. The rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted, which will affect the amount of the special assessment. Under the rule, the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an insured depository institution (“IDI”) reported in its December 31, 2022 Call Report, excluding the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points per year (3.36 basis points per quarter) over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024. Because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis. In its December 31, 2022 Call Report, Old National Bank reported estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $
12.0
 billion. The Company expects the special assessments to be tax deductible. The total of the special assessments for Old National Bank was estimated at $
19.1
 million, and such amount was recorded within FDIC assessment expense in the year ended December 31, 2023. Old National recorded an additional $
3.0
 million within FDIC assessment expense for this special assessment in the year ended December 31, 2024.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.
We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
Old National is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest in approved qualified affordable housing, renewable energy, or other renovation or community revitalization projects. These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, with any unfunded commitments included with other liabilities. Certain of these assets qualify for the proportional amortization method and are amortized over the period that Old National expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense included within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. The other investments are accounted for under the equity or consolidation method, with the expense included within noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of income. All of our tax credit investments are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
Loss Contingencies
Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure.
86
Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows
For the purpose of presentation in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash, due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements, and money market investments, which have maturities less than 90 days. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired, are classified at that time according to management’s intent to either sell or hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management’s intent is to sell the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented as operating cash flows. When management’s intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows.

Business Combinations
Old National accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of merger or acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Alternatively, a gain is recorded if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price. Old National typically issues Common Stock and/or pays cash for a merger or acquisition, depending on the terms of the agreement. The value of Common Stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the merger or acquisition. Merger and acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
Revenue From Contracts With Customers
Old National’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 is recognized within noninterest income. A description of the Company’s significant revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 follows:
Wealth and investment services fees
: Old National earns wealth management fees based upon asset custody and investment management services provided to individual and institutional customers. Most of these customers receive monthly or quarterly billings for services rendered based upon the market value of assets in custody. Fees that are transaction based are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed. Investment product fees are the commissions and fees received from third-party registered broker/dealers and investment advisers that provide those services to Old National customers. Old National acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and the third-party service provider. These fees are recognized monthly from the third-party broker based upon services already performed, net of the processing fees charged to Old National by the broker.
Service charges on deposit accounts
: Old National earns fees from deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees and overdraft fees are recognized at a point in time, 
87
since the customer generally has a right to cancel the depository arrangement at any time. The arrangement is considered a day-to-day contract with ongoing renewals and optional purchases, so the duration of the contract does not extend beyond the services already performed. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which Old National satisfies its performance obligation.
Debit card and automated teller machine (“ATM”) fees
: Debit card and ATM fees include ATM usage fees and debit card interchange income. As with the transaction-based fees on deposit accounts, the ATM fees are recognized at the point in time that Old National fulfills the customer’s request. Old National earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions processed through card association networks. Interchange rates are generally set by the card associations based upon purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder.
Impact of Accounting Changes
Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2024
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820 
– In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
, to clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2024 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASC 323 
– In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
, which allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2024 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASC 848 
– In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
, which provides temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, the transition away from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or other interbank offered rate on financial reporting. The guidance is applicable only to contracts or hedge accounting relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued.
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848
, which defers the sunset date of relief provisions within Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide relief during the transition period.
The amendments in this ASU are effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, all of the Company’s LIBOR exposure was remediated. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASC 280 
– In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
 The amendments are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. A public entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption
FASB ASC 740 
– In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. Among other things, these amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis disclose additional information in specified categories with respect to the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. It also requires greater detail about individual reconciling items in the rate reconciliation to the extent the impact of those items exceeds a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). In addition, the ASU requires information pertaining to taxes paid (net of refunds received) to be disaggregated for federal, state, and foreign taxes and further disaggregated for specific jurisdictions to the extent the related amounts are equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Old National does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASC 220 
– In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. This ASU requires public companies to disclose specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements at each interim and annual reporting period. Specifically, public companies will be required to disclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory; (b) employee compensation; (c) depreciation; (d) intangible asset amortization; and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil- and gas-producing activities (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in each relevant expense caption. Within the same tabular disclosure, an entity must disclose certain expense, gain, or loss amounts that are already required under current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Further, an entity must disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. In addition, an entity must disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASC 470 
– In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, 
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments
. This ASU clarifies requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments, including convertible debt instruments with cash conversion features or convertible debt instruments that are not currently convertible, should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

As a result of the merger, Old National assumed sponsorship of First Midwest’s defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) under which both plan participation and benefit accruals had been previously frozen. The Pension Plan was terminated in November 2022, which included the settlement of benefit obligations associated with the Pension Plan. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 remaining Pension Plan assets. Pension costs were not material in 2024 or 2023.
Pending Acquisition
Bremer Financial Corporation
On November 25, 2024, Old National entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Old National will acquire Bremer Financial Corporation (“Bremer”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Bremer Bank, National Association. As of December 31, 2024, Bremer had $
16.5
 billion in total assets, $
11.8
 billion in total loans, and $
13.2
 billion in deposits. Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, each outstanding share of Bremer common stock will be converted into the right to receive 
4.182
 shares of Old National common stock plus $
26.22
 in cash, valuing the transaction at approximately $
1.4
 billion, or $
116.76
 per share, based on Old National’s closing stock price on November 22, 2024. The transaction value is likely to change until closing due to fluctuations in the price of Old National common stock. The definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Bremer and Old National. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the approval of Bremer shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the middle of 2025.
91
In addition, on November 25, 2024, Old National announced that it entered into a forward sale agreement with Citibank, N.A. (the “Forward Purchaser”) to issue 
19,047,619
 shares of Old National common stock for an aggregate offering amount of $
400.0
 million and entered into an underwriting agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative for the underwriters named therein (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Forward Purchaser, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as forward seller (the “Forward Seller”). The Underwriters were also granted a 
30-day
 option to purchase up to an additional 
2,857,143
 shares of Old National common stock. On November 25, 2024, the Underwriters exercised this option in full, upon which Old National entered into an additional forward sale agreement to issue 
2,857,143
 shares of Old National common stock. The Company did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock sold by the Forward Seller to the Underwriters. Old National expects to physically settle the forward sale agreements (by the delivery of shares of Old National common stock) and receive proceeds from the sale of those shares of Old National common stock upon one or more forward settlement dates within approximately 12 months from the date of the forward sale agreements at the then applicable forward sale price. The forward sale agreements are classified as equity instruments under ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.
Transaction costs totaling $
2.5
 million associated with the merger have been expensed in 2024 and additional transaction and integration costs will be expensed in future periods as incurred.
Divestitures
On November 18, 2022, Old National sold its business of acting as a qualified custodian for, and administering, health savings accounts. Old National served as custodian for health savings accounts comprised of both investment accounts and deposit accounts. At closing, the health savings accounts held in deposit accounts that were transferred totaled approximately $
382
 million and resulted in a $
90.7
 million pre-tax gain.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, Old National initiated certain property optimization actions that included the closure and consolidation of certain branches as well as other real estate repositioning across our footprint. These actions resulted in pre-tax charges associated with valuation adjustments related to these locations totaling $
26.8
 million and $
1.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and were recorded in noninterest expense.

The unrecognized losses on held-to-maturity investment securities presented in the table above do not include unrecognized losses on securities that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-for-maturity totaling $
110.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
127.6
 million at December 31, 2023. These unrecognized losses are included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and are being amortized over the remaining term of the securities.
No
 allowance for credit losses for 
available-for-sale debt securities
 was needed at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
95
An allowance on held-to-maturity debt securities is maintained for certain municipal bonds to account for expected lifetime credit losses. Substantially all of the U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies and agency mortgage-backed securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major credit rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities was $
0.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable on securities portfolio is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and totaled $
55.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
50.3
 million at December 31, 2023.
At December 31, 2024, Old National’s securities portfolio consisted of 
3,006
 securities, 
2,639
 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The unrealized losses attributable to our U.S. Treasury, U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities, states and political subdivisions, and other securities are the result of fluctuations in interest rates and market movements. Old National’s pooled trust preferred securities are evaluated using collateral-specific assumptions to estimate the expected future interest and principal cash flows. At December 31, 2024, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.
Old National’s pooled trust preferred securities have experienced credit defaults. However, we believe that the value of the instruments lies in the full and timely interest payments that will be received through maturity, the steady amortization that will be experienced until maturity, and the full return of principal by the final maturity of the collateralized debt obligations. Old National did not recognize any losses on these securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
Equity Securities
Equity securities consist of mutual funds for Community Reinvestment Act qualified investments and diversified investment securities held in a grantor trust for participants in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Old National’s equity securities with readily determinable fair values totaled $
92.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
80.4
 million at December 31, 2023. There were gains on equity securities of $
0.9
 million during 2024, gains on equity securities of $
21.5
 million during 2023, and losses on equity securities of $
4.9
 million during 2022 recorded in noninterest income.
Alternative Investments
Old National has alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that are included in other assets totaling $
609.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
449.3
 million at December 31, 2023. These investments consisted of $
318.5
 million of illiquid investments of partnerships, limited liability companies, and other ownership interests that support affordable housing and $
290.7
 million of economic development and community revitalization initiatives in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods, compared to $
252.2
 million and $
197.1
 million for the same investment types, respectively, at December 31, 2023. There were 
no
 impairments or adjustments on equity securities without readily determinable fair values, except for amortization of tax credit investments during 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for detail regarding these investments.
NOTE 4 – 
LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Loans
Old National’s loans consist primarily of loans made to consumers and commercial clients in many diverse industries, including real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture, among others. Most of Old National’s lending activity occurs within our principal geographic markets in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size.
In the ordinary course of business, Old National grants loans to certain executive officers and directors (collectively referred to as “related parties”). The aggregate amount of loans to related parties was not greater than 
5
% of the Company’s shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Old National has loan participations, which qualify as participating interests, with other financial institutions. At December 31, 2024, these loans totaled $
3.3
 billion, of which $
1.5
 billion had been sold to other financial institutions and $
1.8
 billion was retained by Old National. The loan participations convey proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest holder; involve no recourse (other than ordinary 
96
representations and warranties) to, or subordination by, any participating interest holder; all cash flows are divided among the participating interest holders in proportion to each holder’s share of ownership; and no holder has the right to pledge the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree.
The loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures. The 
four
 loan portfolios used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields – commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer – are reclassified into 
seven
 segments of loans – commercial, commercial real estate, business banking credit center (“BBCC”), residential real estate, indirect, direct, and home equity for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses on loans. The commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC portfolio segments. The consumer loan category shown on the balance sheet is comprised of the same loans in the indirect, direct, and home equity portfolio segments.

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows:
Commercial
Commercial loans are classified primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its clients.
97
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans are classified primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing Old National’s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner-occupied loans.
Included with commercial real estate are construction loans, which are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and feasibility studies, if available. Construction loans are generally based on estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders (including Old National), sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Old National until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing.
At 
237
%, Old National Bank’s applicable investor commercial real estate loans as a percentage of its Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses attributable to loans and leases remained below the regulatory guideline limit of 
300
% at December 31, 2024.
BBCC
BBCC loans are typically granted to small businesses with gross revenues of less than $5 million and aggregate debt of less than $1 million. Old National has established minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores for owners and guarantors, and the ability to show relatively stable earnings as criteria to help mitigate risk. Repayment of these loans depends on the personal income of the borrowers and the cash flows of the business. These factors can be affected by such changes as economic conditions and unemployment levels.
Residential
With respect to residential loans that are secured by 1 - 4 family residences and are generally owner occupied, Old National typically establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and generally requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in residential property values. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.
Indirect
Indirect loans are secured by automobile collateral, generally new and used cars and trucks from auto dealers that operate within our footprint. Old National typically mitigates the risk of indirect loans by establishing minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers and ongoing reviews of dealer relationships.
Direct
Direct loans are typically secured by collateral such as auto or real estate or are unsecured. Old National has established underwriting standards such as minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers.
98
Home Equity
Home equity loans are generally secured by 1-4 family residences that are owner-occupied. Old National has established underwriting standards such as minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers, along with monitoring of updated borrower credit scores.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Loans
Credit loss assumptions used when computing the level of expected credit losses are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The base forecast scenario considers unemployment, gross domestic product, and the BBB ratio (BBB spread to the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate). In addition to the quantitative inputs, several qualitative factors are considered. These factors include the risk that macroeconomic forecasts of unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index, and the BBB ratio may prove to be more severe and/or prolonged than our baseline forecast due to a variety of considerations.

The allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2024 included $
26.7
 million of allowance for credit losses on acquired PCD loans established through acquisition accounting adjustments on or after the CapStar acquisition date. In addition, the provision for credit losses on loans in the year ended December 31, 2024 included $
15.3
 million to establish an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans acquired in the CapStar transaction. 
Accrued interest receivable on loans is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and totaled $
171.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
169.8
 million at December 31, 2023.
Unfunded Loan Commitments
Old National maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses. 
Old National’s activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was as follows:

Credit Quality
Old National’s management monitors the credit quality of its loans on an ongoing basis with the AQR for commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC loans reviewed annually or at renewal and the performance of its residential and consumer loans based upon the accrual status refreshed at least quarterly. Internally, management assigns an AQR to each non-homogeneous commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC loan in the portfolio. The primary determinants of the AQR are the reliability of the primary source of repayment and the past, present, and projected financial condition of the borrower. The AQR will also consider current industry conditions. Major factors used in determining the AQR can vary based on the nature of the loan, but commonly include factors such as debt service coverage, internal cash flow, liquidity, leverage, operating performance, debt burden, FICO scores, occupancy, interest rate sensitivity, and expense burden. Old National uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
Special Mention
. Loans categorized as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Classified – Substandard
. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Classified – Nonaccrual
. Loans classified as nonaccrual have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, in doubt.
Classified – Doubtful
. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as nonaccrual, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection

or liquidation

in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Pass rated loans are those loans that are other than special mention, classified – substandard, classified – nonaccrual, or classified – doubtful.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans
Old National does not record interest on nonaccrual loans until principal is recovered. For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 
90
 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued but not received is reversed against earnings. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured.

Interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans was insignificant during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and the loan is expected to be repaid substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The class of loan represents the primary collateral type associated with the loan. Significant quarter-over-quarter changes are reflective of changes in nonaccrual status and not necessarily associated with credit quality indicators like appraisal value. 
The following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans by class of loan:

Financial Difficulty Modifications
Occasionally, Old National modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or interest rate reduction (or a combination thereof). When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses on loans.

Finance Leases
Old National leases certain banking center buildings and equipment under finance leases that are included in premises and equipment. See Notes 6 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for detail regarding these leases.
NOTE 6 – 
LEASES
Old National determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment and other borrowings in our consolidated balance sheets.
Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the implicit lease rate when readily determinable. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Old National has operating and finance leases for land, office space, banking centers, and equipment. These leases are generally for periods of 
5
 to 
30
 years with various renewal options. We include certain renewal options in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities if they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or a rate are initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability. Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in profit and loss when incurred. Variable lease payments are defined as payments made for the right to use an asset that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time.
Old National has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases, non-lease components and other non-components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated. For certain equipment leases, Old National accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component using the practical expedient available for that class of assets. Old National does not have any material sub-lease agreements.

Junior Subordinated Debentures
Junior  subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities are classified in “other borrowings” and qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, subject to certain limitations.
Through various mergers and acquisitions, Old National assumed junior subordinated debenture obligations related to various trusts that issued trust preferred securities. Old National guarantees the payment of distributions on the trust preferred securities issued by the trusts. Proceeds from the issuance of each of these securities were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures with the same financial terms as the securities issued by the trusts.
Old National, at any time, may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at par and, thereby cause a redemption of the trust preferred securities in whole or in part.

The Company’s retained earnings at December 31, 2024 included an appropriation for acquired thrifts’ tax bad debt allowances totaling $
58.6
 million for which no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made. If in the future, this portion of retained earnings were distributed as a result of the liquidation of the Company or its subsidiaries, federal and state income taxes would be imposed at the then applicable rates.
No
 valuation allowance was required on the Company’s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 or 2023. Old National has federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling $
60.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
63.6
 million at December 31, 2023. This federal net operating loss was acquired from the acquisition of Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. in 2016, First Midwest in 2022, and CapStar in 2024. If not used, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2032 and later. Old National has recorded state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $
106.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
116.9
 million at December 31, 2023. If not used, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2028 to 2036. 
The federal and recorded state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 382. Old National believes that all of the federal and recorded state net operating loss carryforwards will be used prior to expiration.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Old National has unrecognized tax benefits due to the merger with First Midwest.

If recognized, approximately $

 million of unrecognized tax benefits, net of interest, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. Old National expects the $
5.6
 million of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced to $
5.0
 million in the next twelve months.
It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties accrued relative to unrecognized tax benefits in their respective federal or state income tax accounts. Interest and penalties recorded and accrued in 2024 and 2023 were immaterial.
Old National and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as filing various state returns. The 2021 through 2024 tax years are open and subject to examination.
NOTE 16 – 
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Our Amended and Restated 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “ICP”), which was approved by shareholders, permits the grant of share-based awards to our employees. At December 31, 2024, 
4.9
 million shares were available for issuance. The granting of awards to key employees is typically in the form of restricted stock or performance share awards or units. We believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders. Total compensation cost included in salaries and employee benefits for the ICP was $
32.3
 million in 2024, $
27.9
 million in 2023, and $
28.7
 million in 2022. The total income tax benefit was $
7.9
 million in 2024, $
6.9
 million in 2023, and $
7.1
 million in 2022.
Restricted Stock Awards
Restricted stock awards require certain continued service requirements to be met and shares generally vest, depending on the award terms, annually over a 
three-year
 period, at the end of a 
one-year
 period, cliff vest in 
three years
 from the grant date, or vest 
50
% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 
50
% on the third anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Shares are subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture by the participants.

For certain awards, the level of performance could increase or decrease the number of shares earned. Shares are subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture by the participants.

Stock Options and Appreciation Rights
Old National has not granted stock options since 2009. However, Old National did acquire stock options and stock appreciation rights through its prior acquisitions. Old National recorded 
no
 incremental expense associated with the conversion of these options and stock appreciation rights.
As of December 31, 2024, all options were fully vested, and all compensation costs had been expensed. At December 31, 2024, no stock appreciation rights were outstanding as the remaining awards were exercised during 2023.

The Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) allows employees to make pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions. Subject to the conditions and limitations of the 401(k) Plan, new employees are automatically enrolled in the 401(k) Plan with an automatic deferral of 
5
% of eligible compensation, unless participation is changed or declined. All active participants receive a Company match of 
100
% of the first 
5
% contributed into the 401(k) Plan. In addition to matching contributions, Old National may make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan in the form of Old National stock or cash. In 2024, Old National made a discretionary employer cash contribution of 
4
% of participants’ eligible 2023 compensation. There were 
no
 designated discretionary 
120
contributions in 2023 or 2022. All contributions vest immediately, and plan participants may elect to redirect funds among any of the investment options provided under the 
401(
k) Plan. The number of Old National shares in the 401(k) Plan were 
0.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 
1.1
 million at December 31, 2023. All shares owned through the 401(k) Plan are included in the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted and basic earnings per share. Contribution expense under the 401(k) Plan was $
34.8
 million in 2024, $
20.3
 million in 2023, and $
17.9
 million in 2022.
NOTE 17 – 
SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Old National has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan under which common shares issued may be either repurchased shares or authorized and previously unissued shares. A new plan became effective on August 13, 2024, with total authorized and unissued shares of common stock reserved for issuance of 
3.0
 million. At December 31, 2024, 
3.0
 million authorized and unissued shares of common stock were available for issuance under the plan.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Old National has an employee stock purchase plan under which eligible employees can purchase common shares at a discount to the market price. Currently, the discount under the plan is set at 
5
% of the fair value of the common shares on the purchase date (i.e., at a purchase price of 
95
%). No participant may purchase common shares with a fair value in excess of $
25,000
 in any calendar year. In 2024, 
62,000
 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $
1.0
 million. In 2023, 
75,000
 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $
1.1
 million.
Share Repurchase Program
In the first quarter of 2024, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to $
200
 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock, as conditions warrant, through February 28, 2025. During 2024, 
no
 common shares were repurchased under the plan. On February 19, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $
200
 million of its outstanding common stock through February 28, 2026. This new stock repurchase program replaces the prior $
200
 million program, which was scheduled to expire February 28, 2025. 
Net Income per Common Share
Basic and diluted net income per common share are calculated using the two-class method. Net income applicable to common shares is divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Adjustments to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute net income per common share. Net income applicable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents during the period.

NOTE 18 – 
FAIR VALUE
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
•
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
•
Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
•
Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
Old National used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument:
Investment securities and equity securities
: The fair values for investment securities and equity securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted cash flows are calculated using swap and SOFR curves plus spreads that adjust for loss severities, volatility, credit risk, and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations.
Loans held-for-sale
: The fair value of loans held-for-sale is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan (Level 2).
Derivative financial instruments
: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotes developed using observable inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2).

Commercial and commercial real estate loans that are deemed collateral dependent are valued using the discounted cash flows. The liquidation amounts are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral using the most recently available appraisals with certain adjustments made based on the type of property, age of appraisal, current status of the property, and other related factors to estimate the current value of the collateral. These commercial and commercial real estate loans had a principal amount of $
213.8
 million, with a valuation allowance of $
58.7
 million at December 31, 2024. Old National recorded provision expense associated with commercial and commercial real estate loans that were deemed collateral dependent totaling $
49.0
 million in 2024.
Other real estate owned and other repossessed property is measured at fair value less costs to sell on a non-recurring basis and had a net carrying amount of $

Fair Value Option
Old National may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in net income. After the initial adoption, the election is made at the acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability, or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made.
Loans Held-For-Sale
Old National has elected the fair value option for loans held-for-sale. For these loans, interest income is recorded in the consolidated statements of income based on the contractual amount of interest income earned on the financial assets (except any that are on nonaccrual status). None of these loans are 
90
 days or more past due, nor are any on nonaccrual status. Included in the income statement is interest income for loans held-for-sale totaling $
2.3
 million in 2024, $
1.2
 million in 2023, and $
1.8
 million in 2022.
Newly originated conforming fixed-rate and adjustable-rate first mortgage loans are intended for sale and are hedged with derivative instruments. Old National has only elected the fair value option for other instruments in order to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplification. The fair value option was not elected for loans held for investment.
The difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining principal balance for loans for which the fair value option has been elected was as follows:

The methods utilized to measure the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 represent an approximation of exit price, however, an actual exit price may differ.
NOTE 19 – 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As part of our overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors. The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual agreements. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and are not reported on a net basis.
Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Old National’s exposure is limited to the termination value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal, or contract amounts. There are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, we minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.
Derivatives Designated as Hedges
Subsequent changes in fair value for a hedging instrument that has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship are accounted for in the following manner:
Cash flow hedges
: changes in fair value are recognized as a component in other comprehensive income (loss).
Fair value hedges
: changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings.
As long as a hedging instrument is designated, and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, 
100
% of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are accounted for as outlined above. This is the case whether or not economic mismatches exist in the hedging 
127
relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge gains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings.
The change in fair value of the hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is presented in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps of certain borrowings were designated as cash flow hedges totaling $
150.0
 million notional amount at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest rate swaps, collars, and floors related to variable-rate commercial loan pools were designated as cash flow hedges totaling $
1.9
 billion notional amount at December 31, 2024 and $
1.6
 billion notional amount at December 31, 2023. The hedges were determined to be effective during all periods presented and we expect them to remain effective during the remaining terms.
Old National has designated its interest rate collars as cash flow hedges. The structure of these instruments is such that Old National pays the counterparty an incremental amount if the collar index exceeds the cap rate. Conversely, Old National receives an incremental amount if the index falls below the floor rate. No payments are required if the collar index falls between the cap and floor rates. 
Old National has designated its interest rate floor transactions as cash flow hedges. The structure of these instruments is such that Old National receives an incremental amount if the index falls below the floor strike rate. No payments are required if the index remains above the floor strike rate.
Fair Value Hedges
Interest rate swaps of certain borrowings were designated as fair value hedges totaling $
1.1
 billion notional amount at December 31, 2024 and $
900.0
 million notional amount at December 31, 2023. Interest rate swaps of certain available-for-sale investment securities were designated as fair value hedges totaling $
927.4
 million notional amount at December 31, 2024 and $
998.1
 million notional amount at December 31, 2023. The hedges were determined to be effective during all periods presented and we expect them to remain effective during the remaining terms.

Amounts reported in AOCI related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest income or interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on Old National’s derivative instruments. During the next 12 months, we estimate that $
4.2
 million will be reclassified to interest income and $
17.6
 million will be reclassified to interest expense.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges
Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (“interest rate lock commitments”) and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors (“forward mortgage loan contracts”) are considered derivatives. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. At December 31, 2024, the notional amounts of the interest rate lock commitments were $
57.4
 million and forward mortgage loan contracts were $
88.8
 million. At December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of the interest rate lock commitments were $
25.2
 million and forward commitments were $
39.5
 million. It is our practice to enter into forward mortgage loan contracts for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans to third-party investors when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from our commitment to fund the loans.
Old National also enters into derivative instruments for the benefit of its clients. The notional amounts of these customer derivative instruments and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $
6.3
 billion at December 31, 2024 and $
6.0
 billion at December 31, 2023. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge 
129
accounting. These instruments include interest rate swaps and collars.

Commonly, Old National will economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of clients by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms.
Old National enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency risk management strategies. These derivative instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts to accommodate the business needs of its clients. Old National does not designate these foreign currency forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment.

Fair Value of Offsetting Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements with counterparties that provide rights of setoff. The Company records these transactions at their gross fair values and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 20 – 
COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES
Litigation
At December 31, 2024, there were certain legal proceedings pending against the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, the Company’s management does not expect that any potential liabilities arising from pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, or results of operations.
Credit-Related Financial Instruments
Old National holds instruments, in the normal course of business with clients, that are considered financial guarantees and are recorded at fair value. Standby letters of credit guarantees are issued in connection with agreements made by clients to counterparties. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon failure of the client to perform the terms of the underlying contract. Credit risk associated with standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that associated with extending loans to clients and is subject to normal credit policies. The term of these standby letters of credit is typically 
one year
 or less. These commitments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
The following table summarizes Old National Bank’s unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit:

Notional amount, which represents the maximum amount of future funding requirements. The carrying value was $
1.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
1.3
 million at December 31, 2023.
At December 31, 2024, approximately 
4
% of the unfunded loan commitments had fixed rates, with the remainder having floating rates ranging from 
0.00
% to 
21.49
%. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments totaled $
21.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
31.2
 million at December 31, 2023.
Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amounts of $
730.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
557.8
 million at December 31, 2023.
Visa Class B Restricted Shares
In 2008, Old National received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa’s initial public offering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Old National sold the 
65,466
 Class B shares and recognized a $
21.6
 million pre-tax gain. Prior to the sale, the shares were carried at a 
zero
 cost basis due to uncertainty surrounding the ability of the Company to transfer or otherwise liquidate the shares. After the sale, the Company did not hold any remaining Visa Class B restricted shares.
NOTE 21 – 
REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS
Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks
Old National did 
no
t have cash and due from banks which was held as collateral for collateralized swap positions at December 31, 2024, compared to $
0.3
 million at December 31, 2023.
Restrictions on Transfers from Bank Subsidiary
Regulations limit the amount of dividends a bank subsidiary can declare in any calendar year without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of net income of the current year combined with retained net income for the preceding 
two years
. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2022, 2023, or 2024 and is not currently required. A bank subsidiary is prohibited from paying a dividend, if, after making the dividend, the bank would be considered “undercapitalized” (as defined by reference to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (“OCC’s”) capital 
131
regulations). At December 31, 2024, Old National Bank could pay dividends of $
889.2
 million without prior regulatory approval and while maintaining capital levels above regulatory minimum and well-capitalized guidelines.
Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends
Old National has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend on its outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions, as well as approval by our Board of Directors. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on Old National’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.
Capital Adequacy
Old National and Old National Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Old National’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Old National and Old National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Old National and Old National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following tables.
At December 31, 2024, Old National and Old National Bank each exceeded the capital ratios required to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulations.

“Well-capitalized” minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average assets ratios are not formally defined under applicable banking regulations for bank holding companies.
During 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued final rules to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of current expected credit loss (“CECL”) guidance. The final rules provide banking organizations the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.

NOTE 23 – 
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in assessing performance and in deciding how to allocate resources. Old National’s CODM is the Chairman and CEO of the Company. 
Through our wholly owned banking subsidiary and non-bank affiliates, we provide a wide range of services primarily throughout the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States and elsewhere, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, private banking, capital markets, brokerage, wealth management, trust, investment advisory, and other traditional banking services. The Company’s business activities are predominantly similar in their nature, operations, and economic characteristics, largely serving commercial and specialty banking clients with products and services that are offered through overall similar processes and platforms. The accounting policies for the services discussed here are the same as those described in Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. We earn interest income on loans as well as fee income from the origination of loans and from fees charged on deposit accounts. Lending activities include loans to individuals, which primarily consist of home equity lines of credit, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans, and loans to commercial clients, which include commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans, letters of credit, and lease financing. Residential real estate loans are either kept in our loan portfolio or sold to secondary investors, with gains or losses from the sales being recognized. 
The CODM uses consolidated net income to monitor results, evaluate budget-to-actual variances, perform competitive analyses that benchmark the Company to competitors, and determine whether to reinvest earnings in the Company or to deploy capital in other ways to maximize shareholder value. The CODM is regularly provided with

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 Old National’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that Old National’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are effective at the reasonable assurance level as discussed below to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Old National in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Old National’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The attestation report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Old National’s independent registered public accounting firm, on Old National’s internal control over financial reporting is included on the following page.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
 Management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that Old National’s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be only reasonable assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, the system of controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 There were no changes in Old National’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Old National’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Old National Bancorp
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Old National Bancorp and subsidiaries (“Old National”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, Old National maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 of Old National and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
Old National’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Old National’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Old National in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
