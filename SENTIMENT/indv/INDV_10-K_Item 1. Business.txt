Critical Accounting Estimates
Management makes several estimates and assumptions regarding the future and significant judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of the amount, events or actions; however, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. The key estimates and assumptions used in the financial statements are set out below.
118
Returns, incentives and rebates
The Company offers various types of reductions from list prices on its products. Products sold in the U.S. are covered by various programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. 
The discounts, incentives and rebates described above are estimated based on contractual arrangements with customers or terms of the relevant regulations and/or agreements applicable for transactions with healthcare authorities, and in some cases on assumptions about the attainment of targeted volumes. Several months may pass between the original estimate of rebates due and confirmation of the amount, which may increase the estimation risk. Please refer to the revenue accounting policy for further details.
Accruals for product returns are estimated based primarily on analysis of the Company’s historical product return patterns, expected future returns, and contractual agreement terms. Estimated returns are accrued in the period the related revenue is recognized.
During 2024 and 2022, net revenue was increased by $28 million and $14 million, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied in prior years, primarily relating to changes in payor mix and resolution of aged accruals for U.S. government programs. During 2023, net revenue was reduced by $9 million from performance obligations satisfied in prior years, primarily relating to differences between invoices received from U.S. government programs as compared to the respective accruals held for those years. The estimates for U.S. governmental and commercial end-payor accruals are also reasonably expected to vary due to shifts between U.S. governmental end-payor sales and U.S. commercial end-payor sales. A 1 percentage point shift between these channels would impact the accrual by $4 million. Due to the number of variables contributing to the accruals for returns, incentives and rebates, further meaningful sensitivity is not able to be provided. Accruals for returns, incentives and rebates are disclosed in 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements—Balance Sheet
.
Determination of income tax provision
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. These judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes to these estimates may result in a material increase or decrease in our tax provision in the current period or subsequent periods.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Also, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If all or part of our deferred tax assets are not recoverable in the future, we must increase our provision for taxes and reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. To recover deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, in determining the need for a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we believe our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered, with the exception of valuation allowance items as detailed in 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4. Income Tax
. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future forecasted income do not support the realization of our deferred tax assets. Should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
119
Ongoing litigation
The Company is involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to compliance and trade practices, commercial claims, product liability claims, intellectual property rights, and employment and wrongful discharge claims. For each claim or grouping of similar claims, management makes judgments regarding the relative merits and risks within the claims. These judgments inform the Company’s defense strategies, whether a loss or settlement from the claims is probable and whether sufficient information exists to make a reliable estimate of he likely outcome of the claims. Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation, an outflow of resource to settle the obligation when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has assessed as “contingent” matters that cannot be reliably estimated or are not considered probable at the current time. For more details of all the outstanding legal proceedings including those that have been deemed contingent, see

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
—
Liquidity and Capital Resources
.
 In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks, such as market risk (including foreign currency exchange, cash flow and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
b. Qualitative Information about Market Risk
We invest cash equivalents and investments with the primary objective to preserve principal while also maximizing the income that we receive. We invest in highly-rated corporate bonds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasuries for purposes other than trading which are reported at fair value or amortized cost, which approximates fair value for the nature and duration of instruments we use. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. See 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.
Interest on our Note Purchase Agreement is subject to fluctuation based on SOFR, which may impact future expense and cash flows. See 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 12. Debt.
We operate in different territories around the world. Generally, the functional currency of our operations is that of the country in which it operates. One USD functional currency subsidiary has significant exposure to assets in Canadian Dollars and liabilities in British Pounds Sterling. The Canadian Dollar assets turn quickly and our strategy is to mitigate exposure to British Pounds with offsetting assets. However, we could be exposed to material foreign currency risk in these currencies.

Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
1. Business Overview 
Indivior PLC and its subsidiaries (together, “Indivior” or the “Company”) is a global pharmaceutical company working to help change patients’ lives by pioneering life-transforming treatment for addiction, including SUBLOCADE (buprenorphine extended-release) injection for subcutaneous use, a long-acting injectable (LAI) for opioid use disorder and OPVEE (Nalmefene) nasal spray for opioid overdose recovery. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. Unless otherwise stated, these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all the Company’s subsidiaries and are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages and per share data have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.
The Company previously prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. As part of the Company’s efforts to align with industry peers and prepare for the expected loss of foreign private issuer status, the Company elected to file its 2024 annual report on Form 10-K, including presentation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The transition to U.S. GAAP is reflected retrospectively for all periods from the Company’s inception.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
 See 
Note 13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
 for additional information on the fair value hierarchy used by the Company.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of each of the Company’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency), which is generally the local currency with the exception of manufacturing, treasury and holding companies where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company’s presentation currency is the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for shareholders’ equity and weighted average exchange rates for operating results. Translation gains and losses are recognized in Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
Use of Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Significant estimates are used in determining items such as accruals for returns, incentives and rebates, impairment of intangible assets, acquisitions, and ongoing litigation. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions, and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months and are recognized at cost, which approximates fair value.
127
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
Accounts Receivable, Net 
Accounts receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts less any adjustments for estimated deductions such as cash discounts.

Provisions for expected credit losses are established using an expected credit loss model (“ECL”) taking into account individual customer’s credit risk based on financial position, past experience, and other relevant factors.
Charges for ECL are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expense.
 The provision for ECL was approximately $
3
 million and $
2
 million at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash and cash equivalents deposited with banks and other financial institutions, investment in debt securities, accounts receivable and other assets. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Company’s counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above. All the Company’s investments in debt securities are of low credit risk based on investment-grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s (BBB-/Baa3 or higher).

As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company had four separate customers representing greater than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance.

Investments
The Company’s investments comprise holdings in equity and debt securities. Investments in equity securities which have readily available fair values are initially recorded and subsequently remeasured at fair value through earnings.
Investments in debt securities are initially recorded at fair value and remeasured based on the intended holding period. Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Held to maturity investments are classified as long-term investments, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period, which are classified as short-term investments. Declines in fair value below amortized cost related to credit losses (i.e., impairment due to credit losses) are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with a corresponding allowance established. If the estimate of expected credit losses decreases in subsequent periods, the Company will reverse the credit losses through current period earnings and adjust the allowance accordingly.
Inventories
Raw materials and consumables, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first in, first out method. Cost comprises materials, direct labor, and an appropriate allocation of overhead expenses (based on normal operating capacity) required to get the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less applicable selling expenses. Write-down of inventory occurs in the general course of business and is recognized in cost of sales.
Property, Plant and Equipment
128
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, with the exception of land, which is stated at cost less impairment. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. 
For this purpose, useful lives are determined within the following limits:
Assets
Expected useful life
Buildings
Not more than 
20
 years
Plant and Equipment
Not more than 
10
 years
Motor Vehicles and Computer Equipment
Not more than 
4
 years
Leasehold Improvements
Up to the expected lease term
 The estimated useful lives and residual value of property, plant and equipment are assessed periodically and adjusted as required. Current facts and circumstances are periodically evaluated to determine if the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable and an impairment loss it to be recorded, see “
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
” for more information.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives.
Acquired computer software licenses and related implementation costs are capitalized at cost. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, generally over a period of up to 
five years
. Acquired computer software primarily relates to SAP, the Company’s ERP system. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Marketed products include acquired distribution rights and post-approval milestone payments. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over the expected patent life of not more than 
15
 years. Amortization expense is recorded in cost of sales.
Gains and losses on the disposal of intangible assets are determined by comparing the asset’s carrying value with any sale proceeds and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Leases
The Company leases various buildings and equipment (including vehicles). Lease contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 
three
 to 
10
 years but may have termination or extension options. All leased buildings and equipment are classified as operating leases and the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Options to extend or terminate the lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. 
The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and a corresponding liability (“lease liability”) at the lease commencement date, measured on a present value basis.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recognized on the balance sheet. For short-term leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company has made a policy election to separately account for lease and non-lease components. 
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments over the lease term using the discount rate at lease commencement. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease can be determined, it is used to measure the liability. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date is used. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest the lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis, over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the starting point for determining the discount rate, resulting in a range of rates from 
4
% to 
12
% depending upon type of lease and country of origin.
129
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
ROU assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Subsequent to initial measurement, operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease with the ROU asset remeasured at the amount of the remeasured lease liability. ROU assets are assessed periodically for impairment whenever there is an indication the carrying amount may not be recoverable (see “
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”
 for more information).
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets, namely, intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment and ROU assets. The carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) is reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
Employee and Retirement Benefits
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, vacation and accumulating sick leave are recognized at the time of employees’ services and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. These employee benefits are expected to be settled in the next twelve months and are included within accrued expenses.
Some of the Company’s subsidiaries operate defined contribution plans, defined benefit pension plans, and/or provide post-retirement medical care to their retirees. The cost of providing pensions to employees who are members of defined contribution plans is charged to the income statement as services relating to those contributions are received. The Company has no further payment obligations in respect of such plans once the contributions have been paid. Other post-retirement benefits are not material.

Debt
Debt is initially recognized at fair value less attributable transaction costs, including legal and advisory and original issue discount costs. Transaction costs related to the debt placement are deferred against the loan balance and amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. Transaction costs related to the undrawn revolving credit facility are deferred as a prepaid asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period the credit facility will be available. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is stated at amortized cost, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the loan on an effective interest basis. Debt is classified as current or noncurrent based on timing of payments and expected maturity.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies such as legal proceedings and claims that arise out of our business that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, product liability and tax matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
Net revenue is generated from sales of pharmaceutical products, net of discounts and accruals for returns, incentives and rebates ("gross-to-net revenue deductions"). Direct customers are often 
130
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
wholesalers, specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors of pharmaceutical products; indirect customers are often government-sponsored programs or commercial insurers with whom the Company has separate pricing and formulary agreements.
Net revenue is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over pharmaceutical products to the direct customer, substantially all of which is upon receipt of the products by the customer, and therefore all revenue is recognized at a “point in time.” The amount of net revenue recognized is based on the consideration expected in exchange for pharmaceutical products, including reductions in revenue for rebates expected to be paid to indirect customers. The consideration Indivior receives may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company has no material contracts with more than one performance obligation.
During 2023, U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded the Company a contract which included initial purchase and options for purchases and delivery of OPVEE over another 
9
 years at guaranteed pricing through 2033. 
Shipping and handling activities are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. All taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer are excluded from the measurement of the transaction price.
Management is required to determine the net transaction price in respect of each of its contracts with direct and indirect customers. In making such judgment, management assesses the impact of any variable consideration in the contract due to 
gross-to-net revenue deductions
. These are estimated and recognized in the period in which the underlying performance obligation is fulfilled as a reduction of net revenue. 
The following are the Company’s significant categories of gross-to-net revenue deductions: 
•
Government and commercial rebates 
The Company records accruals for rebates for governmental programs as a reduction of sales when the product is sold into the distribution channel. The Company pays rebates to individual U.S. states for all eligible units purchased under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the U.S. ("Medicaid") based on a “per unit rebate” calculation, which is based on the Company’s average manufacturer prices and applicable supplemental agreements. 
Management estimates expected unit sales under Medicaid and adjusts its rebate accrual based on actual unit, per unit rebate amounts and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization.
Commercial rebates include amounts payable to payers and healthcare providers under contractual arrangements and may vary by product. 
Government and commercial rebates are estimated using contracted rates, historical and estimated payer mix, historical utilization trends and payment processing time lag. Additionally, in developing estimates, management considers statutory rebate requirements, estimated patient mix, known market events or trends, channel inventory data obtained from third parties and other pertinent internal or external information. Management assesses and updates estimates each reporting period to reflect billing trends and other current information.
•
Chargebacks
Chargebacks relate to discounts that occur when contracted indirect customers purchase directly from wholesalers and specialty distributors at a contracted price. The wholesaler or specialty distributor, in turn, then generally charges back to the Company the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler or specialty distributor by the customer. 
131
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
Management estimates the accrual for these chargebacks based on historical and expected utilization of these programs. Accruals for chargebacks are recorded within Accrued Rebates and Product Returns as they are settled by payment and not net-settled.
•
Sales returns 
Returns are generally made if the product is damaged, defective or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., the Company typically permit returns 
six months
 prior to and up to 
twelve months
 after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.
Accruals for product returns are estimated based primarily on analysis of the Company’s historical product return patterns, expected future returns, and contractual agreement terms. Estimated returns are accrued in the period the related revenue is recognized.
•
Sales discounts 
Wholesalers, specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors of the Company’s products are generally offered various forms of consideration, including discounts, allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts, for distributing the products. Wholesaler and specialty distributor allowances and service fees arise from contractual agreements and are estimated as a percentage of the price at which the Company sells product to them. Accruals for wholesaler allowances and services fees are recorded within Accrued Rebates and Product Returns as they are settled by rebate payment and not net-settled. In addition, customers are offered a prompt pay discount for payment within a specified contractual period. Prompt pay discounts are classified as reductions of accounts receivable.
Management also takes account of factors such as levels of inventory in its various distribution channels, product expiry dates and information about potential entry of competing products into the market. In each case, the accruals made for allowances noted above are subject to continuous review and adjustment as appropriate, based on the most recent information available to management. 
Adjustments to the accruals may be necessary based on actual utilization information submitted to the Company (in the case of accruals for rebates related to sales targets or contractual rebates), claims/invoices received (in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks) and actual return rates. 
Government and commercial rebates, chargebacks, sales returns and sales discounts to customers are recorded as a reduction in sales.
 As on December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, liabilities in respect of sales returns and rebates totaled $
562
 million and $
535
 million of which 
83
% and 
80
% originated in the US in relation to Managed Care, Federal and Medicaid.
Cost of Sales
The cost of goods sold primarily consists of raw materials, third party manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs, direct labor, cost of write-down of inventory to net realizable value and manufacturing overhead costs. Abnormal idle capacity is expensed as incurred within cost of sales.

Advertising Expense
Advertising expense includes the cost of promotional materials and activities, such as printed materials and digital marketing, marketing programs and speaker programs. Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Advertising expenses were $
68
 million in 2024, $
53
 million in 2023 and $
52
 million in 2022.
Share-based Payments
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under restricted share award plans. Restricted share awards are subject to either service conditions only or service and market conditions, specifically total shareholder return or relative to selected indices. Share-based compensation expense is 
132
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
recorded ratably over the vesting period, regardless of whether the market condition has been satisfied, as an expense in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in-capital. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
 See 
Note 15. Share-Based Payments 
for more information.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including payroll and benefits, pre-clinical, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, manufacturing development and scale-up costs, product development and regulatory costs, contract services and other outside contractor costs, research license fees, depreciation and amortization of lab facilities and lab supplies costs incurred for the acquisition of assets for which there is no alternative future use beyond the development of unapproved pharmaceutical products.
For compounds acquired or licensed before regulatory approval, the Company records acquisition costs, upfront and milestone payments as IPR&D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Acquisition costs and upfront payments are recorded when incurred. The cost of milestones is recorded when probable, which for milestones with regulatory approval requirements is generally when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, any further milestone payments are recorded as acquired distribution rights within intangible assets, less accumulated amortization on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter. 
The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations, clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities.
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring charges are recognized as a result of significant changes in market conditions and actions taken to streamline operations and realize operational synergies. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoing employee termination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates based on currently available information.

Interest Expense
Interest expense includes stated interest and amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount incurred by the Company in connection with the refinancing of its term loan as discussed within 
Note 12. Debt
. The Company amortizes the deferred financing costs and debt discount over the term of the debt, using the effective interest method.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) and deferred tax liabilities (“DTLs”) for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, the Company determines DTAs and DTLs on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on DTAs and DTLs is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
The Company recognizes DTAs to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative 
133
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize our DTAs in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the DTA valuation allowance would be appropriately adjusted, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 
The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
Accrued interest and penalties payable for unrecognized tax benefits are included in either current or non-current income taxes payable. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in interest expense and SG&A expense, respectively.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of ordinary shares and, when dilutive, the weighted-average number of potential common shares outstanding during the period which consist primarily of contingently issuable shares, assuming the vesting of restricted stock and current expected vesting of performance shares, which are added net of applying the treasury stock method.

Unrecognized Tax Benefit
We are subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions. Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the differences between tax positions we have taken or expect to take on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in our financial statements. Resolution of the related tax positions with the relevant tax authorities may take many years to complete, and such timing is not entirely within our control.
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits:

Reinvestment of Unremitted Earnings 
We consider foreign earnings of specific subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. There is no deferred tax liability, recorded, if any on such amounts. If at some future date, the Company ceases to be permanently reinvested in these specific foreign subsidiaries, the Company may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on these undistributed earnings and may need to record a deferred tax liability for any outside basis difference on these specific foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we estimate the unrecorded, deferred tax liability to be, $
2
 million for each of the respective years.
Tax Return Examination Status
The Company files income tax returns in the U.K., U.S. and in various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. We are subject to tax audits in the various jurisdictions until the respective statutes of limitation expire. The Company is no longer subject to U.K. examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before 2019 and U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before 2021. There are ongoing U.K. and U.S. state and local audits covering 2018-2022. An estimate of reasonably possible additional tax liabilities and interest that could arise on resolution of these examinations, including the impact from later periods is in the range of 
nil

The Company has investments in corporate debt securities which are initially recorded at fair value, plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs, and remeasured based on the intended holding period. Interest income on debt securities is included interest income within the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the effective interest method. The Company’s investments are classified as held to maturity investments and reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings.

Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses were not material in 2023 or 2024.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
27
 million of debt securities were held by a separate cell of an insurance company as part of an agreement to fund insurance coverage. These debt securities are classified as non-current as access to the investments is subject to contractual restrictions through at least December 31, 2026, regardless of the underlying investment maturity.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations and as noted above for debt securities held by a separate cell of an insurance company. Held-to-maturity securities with a value of $
27
 million were sold in 2024 sufficiently close to their maturity such that changes in the market interest rate would not have significantly affected the securities' fair value; an insignificant gain was recognized. 
No
 impairment charges were incurred on any held-to-maturity securities in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
The Company also holds investments in equity securities which are initially recorded and subsequently recorded at fair value through earnings. The fair value of the equity securities is based on quoted market prices on the measurement date. See

DOJ-Related
DOJ Resolution Agreement
In July 2020, the Company settled criminal and civil liability with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and U.S. state attorneys general. Pursuant to the resolution agreement, aggregate payments of $
263
 million (including interest) have been made through December 31, 2024. An additional payment of $
52
 million was made in January 2025 and 
two
 annual installments of $
50
 million plus interest will be due in January 2026 and 2027, with the final installment of $
200
 million due in December 2027. The Company has the option to prepay. Interest accrues at 
1.25
%
 on certain portions of the resolution and will be paid with the installment payments. For non-interest-bearing portions, the liability 
144
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
has been recorded at the NPV based on timing of the estimated payments using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the interest-bearing portions.
Antitrust class and state claims
Multi-district antitrust class and state claims
Settlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with 
three
 plaintiff classes to fully resolve certain multi-district antitrust claims. The settlement amount payable to the direct purchaser class received final court approval in 2024. Indivior has no further obligations related to this matter.
Other antitrust claims
Certain antitrust cases filed in Virginia state court were settled and paid during 2024 by agreement of the parties for $
85
 million and mutual releases of claims and counterclaims.
The accrual of $
24
 million at December 31, 2024 relates to a settlement of the last remaining antitrust litigation. An installment of $
15
 million was paid in December 2024 and the remaining liability of $
24
 million December 31, 2024 reflects the NPV at the risk-free rate of the amounts to be paid in 2025. This final settlement resolves all of the Company’s remaining legacy antitrust litigation.
Opioid litigation
The accrual of $
76
 million at December 31, 2024 reflects the present value of the agreed amount in a preliminary settlement between Indivior, the plaintiffs' executive committee and certain state attorneys general covering certain opioid litigation (including cases in the Opioid MDL) brought by municipalities and tribes. The outflow of resources is expected to occur over 
five years
. The parties still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement, including structure, and scope of releases. The provision is measured using a risk free rate and will be remeasured at a risk-adjusted rate upon reaching a final settlement agreement.
Other
Other at December 31, 2024 includes the remaining liability related to an indemnity settlement with Reckitt Benckiser.
See 
Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
 for additional information on legal matters.
12. Debt
In 2024, the Company completed a refinancing of its term loan, repaying in full the previous term loan and replacing it with a new note purchase agreement with principal amount of $
350
 million and a committed, revolving credit facility of $
50
 million, both of which mature in November 2030. 
None
 of the $
50
 million revolving credit facility has been utilized.
As a result of the debt refinancing, the Company incurred a charge of $
3
 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs due to early extinguishment of the previous term loan (recorded in interest expense) and legal and advisory fees of $
4
 million incurred in conjunction with the new note purchase agreement (recorded in SG&A). The Company capitalized $
21
 million of deferred financing and original issue discount costs related to the new agreement, of which $
18
 million is netted against the total amount borrowed and is being amortized over the maturity period using the effective interest method, the remainder of which relates to the undrawn revolving credit facility and is being amortized on a straight-line basis to the maturity date.
The amount of the current and previous term loan of $
333
 million and $
240
 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, is secured by the assets of certain subsidiaries of the Company, primarily in the form of guarantees issued by respective subsidiaries. In relation to these debts, interest paid was $
32
 million, $
26
 million, and $
18
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Interest expense was $
32
 million, $
27
 million, and $
19
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The total leverage ratio is calculated as total debt less up to $
50
 million in cash, divided by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. The Note Purchase Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio to mean Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA divided by interest expense.
 For purposes of the Note Purchase Agreement and Revolving Credit Facility only, the Note Purchase Agreement generally defines "Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA" to mean Consolidated Net Income for such period plus, without duplication, amounts paid or expensed for: taxes; interest; depreciation or amortization; debt, equity, and similar capital issuance costs; letters of credit; capital leases; the acquisition or repayment of any debt securities; board of director fees and expenses; transaction costs and charges incurred in connection with transactions permitted under the Note Purchase Agreement; non-recurring litigation or claim settlement charges; non-cash compensation charges associated with any stock options, restricted stock or other equity instruments; any net after-tax extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual gains or losses; expected cost savings reasonably anticipated to be realized within 
18
 months related to transactions, and related charges and costs; provided that each is counted only to the extent deducted in calculating Consolidated Net Income for such period, and minus certain items such as certain non-cash gains or income to the extent they increased Consolidated Net Income. The Company is in comp
liance with these and all other covenants.

13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, investments in corporate debt securities and investments in equity securities. The carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding debt instruments and the Company’s investments in corporate debt and equity securities, approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest:
•
Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
146
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
•
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets or liabilities are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as assets or liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
The Company’s only financial instruments which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are equity securities. The fair value of the equity securities is based on quoted market prices on the measurement date. 
Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31 are summarized below:

The Company recognized unrealized losses on the remeasurement of equity securities of $
9
 million and $
nil
 in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was recorded in other operating expense (income), net.
The fair value of long-term debt was $
350
 million as of December 31, 2024 and was valued using Level 2 inputs which are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments. The fair value of short-term debt approximates the carrying value due to the short maturities of the debt instruments. 
The fair value of the Company’s corporate debt securities was $
27
 million and $
126
 million at December 31, 2024, and 2023. The fair value of the corporate debt securities held at amortized cost was calculated based on quoted market prices which would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy above.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and net settlement is intended.

The potential shares excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share computation because of the antidilutive impact were 
nil
 in 2024, 
4
 million in 2023, and 
6
 million in 2022.
The weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the number of shares granted to the extent market conditions have been met at the balance sheet date and determined using the treasury stock method.
Conditional awards of 
2
 million shares were granted under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2024 and 2023, respectively. For 2024 and 2023, 
3
 million and 
1
 million share awards were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares, after application of the treasury method, because the market criteria were not met at the balance sheet date.
15. Share-Based Payments
The Company operates 
three
 equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For share-based payment awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate pricing models.
Total pretax share-based compensation cost recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
24
 million, $
21
 million and $
16
 million, respectively. Income tax benefits for stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
5
 million, $
3
 million, and $
3
 million, respectively.
Indivior Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In 2015, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for employees (including executive directors) of the Company. The awards are conditional upon the satisfaction of both market conditions and service period, generally of 
three years
. Awards granted to executive directors are subject to a further post-vesting period of 
two-years
.
The LTIP award shares vest based on a comparison between the share performance of the Company and the share performance of other companies (“Comparators”) within two indices: (1) The FTSE 250 and (2) the S&P 1500 Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index. The conditions are based on calculation of the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for the Company and the Comparators in the FTSE 250, and the TSR for the Comparators in the S&P 1500 Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index and into what percentile the Company falls as compared to the Comparators in each index. The vesting is as follows: a threshold (
12.5
% payout) for 50
th
 percentile performance and maximum (
100
% payout) for 75
th
 percentile performance; with interpolation in between. However, if the performance of the Company falls below the 50
th
 percentile of the index, 
none
 of the shares will vest. An equal weight is given to the performance compared to the FTSE 250 and S&P 1500 Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index.
The fair values of awards granted under the LTIP are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation method. As vesting of the LTIP award shares is based on relative market conditions, an open form model such as the Monte Carlo is required to take into consideration the parameters of the awards. The key assumptions in the simulation model are share price of the Company, expected volatilities of the Company considering a combination of historic and implied volatility, risk-free rate, and dividend yield.

16. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies
The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may involve compliance and trade practices, antitrust, commercial claims, product liability claims, intellectual property rights and securities, among others.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has 
149
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments. Developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause changes in the amounts previously accrued are evaluated each reporting period. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments.
Where the amount and timing of the payment is fixed, the obligation is not interest-bearing, and the impact of discounting is significant, these obligations are recorded at their present value, generally using a discount rate appropriate to the obligation or approximating the risk-free rate at the time the Company incurred the obligation.
The Company does not believe that any of the legal matters discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity as the Company believes it has substantial defenses in the matters. However, the outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of one or more of these pending matters or that any other future legal matters will not be material to Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows for a particular period.
Certain ongoing legal proceedings or threats of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party, but in which the Company believes the possibility of an adverse impact is remote, are not discussed in this Note.
Antitrust Litigation and Consumer Protection
On November 27, 2024, Indivior Inc. and Indivior Solutions Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with Humana Inc. and certain of its affiliates, and Centene Corp. and certain of its affiliates to resolve all remaining antitrust litigation against the Company, including
 Humana Inc. v. Indivior Inc.
, No. 21-CI-004833 (Ky. Cir. Ct.) (Jefferson Cnty), 
Centene Corp. v. Indivior Inc.
, No. CL23000054-00 (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty), and 
Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. et al. v. Reckitt Benckiser Inc., et al.
, Case. No. 2875 (Phila. Ct. Common Pleas). Under the agreement, Indivior Inc. and Indivior Solutions Inc. will pay a total of $
40
 million to the Humana and Centene companies. $
15
 million was paid in December 2024, with the remaining installments of $
5
 million and $
20
 million due on or before March 15, 2025 and December 15, 2025, respectively.
Civil Opioid Litigation
The Company has been named as a defendant in more than 
400
 civil lawsuits alleging that manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of opioids engaged in a longstanding practice to market opioids as safe and effective for the treatment of long-term chronic pain to increase the market for opioids and their own market shares for opioids, or alleging individual personal injury claims. Most of these cases have been consolidated and are pending in a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. 
See In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation
, MDL No. 2804 (N.D. Ohio) (the "Opioid MDL"). Nearly two-thirds of the cases in the Opioid MDL were filed by cities and counties, while nearly one-third of the cases were filed by private plaintiffs, most of whom assert claims relating to neonatal abstinence syndrome ("NAS"). Cases brought by cities and counties outside of the MDL include, for example, 
35
 actions pending in New York state court, 
8
 writs filed in Pennsylvania state court, and actions brought in federal district courts in Florida and Georgia. Litigation against the Company in the Opioid MDL and the other federal courts is stayed. The New York state court has not yet entered a case management order. The Company has not yet been served with a complaint in any of the Pennsylvania state court matters.
Pursuant to mediation, the Company, the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee in the Opioid MDL, Tribal Leadership Committee, and certain state attorneys general reached agreement on the amount of a potential settlement. The Company has recorded a related provision of $
76
 million, reflecting the NPV of the agreed amount (See 
Note 11. Accrued Litigation Settlement Expenses
). The parties, however, still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement, including the ultimate timing and structure 
150
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
of payments and product distribution, injunctive relief, and scope of the release. The proposed settlement would resolve claims by cities and counties, but would not resolve private plaintiff cases against the Company (whether in the MDL or proceeding separately).
With respect to cases outside the MDL that were not filed by cities or counties:
Indivior Inc. was named as a defendant in 
San Miguel Hospital Corp. d/b/a Alta Vista Regional Medical Center v. Johnson & Johnson, et al.
, No. 1:23-cv-00903 (D.N.M.) on March 18, 2024. Indivior moved to dismiss the complaint in May 2024. Indivior's motion to dismiss remains pending.
On October 28, 2024, Indivior Inc. was named as one of numerous defendants in 
five
 individual complaints filed in West Virginia state court that were transferred to West Virginia's Mass Litigation Panel. 
See

In re Opioid Litigation
, No. 22-C-9000 NAS (W.V. Kanawha Cnty. Cir. Ct.) ("WV MLP Action"). All 
five
 of Indivior Inc.'s cases in the WV MLP Action involve claims related to NAS. Indivior Inc. moved to dismiss all 
five
 complaints. The MLP granted Indivior's motion to dismiss on April 17, 2023. The plaintiffs appealed, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals of West Virginia affirmed dismissal of all claims against Indivior on December 27, 2024. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the West Virginia Supreme Court as to all defendants, including Indivior, on February 27, 2025. 
On October 28, 2024, Indivior Inc. was named along with dozens of other manufacturers and distributors in a putative class action brought by West Virginia school districts in federal district court. 
See Marshall County Board of Education and Wetzel County Board of Education v. Cephalon, et al.
, No. 5:24-cv-00207 (N.D.W. Va.). Indivior Inc.'s response to the complaint is not yet due.
Additionally, on May 23, 2024, the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland served on Indivior Inc. an administrative subpoena related generally to opioid products marketed and sold in Maryland. Indivior Inc.’s response to the subpoena remains ongoing.
The Company has begun its evaluation of all of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself in all actions that would not be resolved by the proposed settlement. Given the status and preliminary stage of litigation, no estimate of possible loss for those matters can be made at this time.
False Claims Act Allegations
In August 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia unsealed a declined 
qui tam
 complaint alleging causes of action under the Federal and state False Claims Acts against certain entities within the Company predicated on best price issues and claims of retaliation. 
See

United States ex rel. Miller v. Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC et al.
, Case No. 1:15-cv-00017 (W.D. Va.). The suit also seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss in June 2021, which was granted in part and denied in part on October 17, 2023. The relator filed a sixth amended complaint against only Indivior Inc. on December 7, 2023, which Indivior answered on March 18, 2024. Discovery has been stayed pending resolution of certain discovery disputes. The Company is evaluating the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.
U.K. Shareholder Claims
On September 21, 2022, certain shareholders issued representative and multiparty claims against Indivior PLC in the High Court of Justice for the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, King’s Bench Division. On January 16, 2023, the representative served its Particular of Claims setting forth in more detail the claims against the Group, while the same law firm that represents the representative also sent its draft Particular of Claims for the multiparty action. The claims made in both the representative and multiparty actions generally allege that Indivior PLC violated the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) by making false or misleading statements or material omissions in public disclosures, including the 2014 Demerger Prospectus, regarding an alleged product-hopping scheme regarding the switch from SUBOXONE Tablets to SUBOXONE Film. Indivior PLC filed an application to strike out the representative action. On December 5, 2023, the court handed down a judgment allowing the Company's 
151
Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
application to strike out the representative action. The court subsequently awarded certain costs to the Company. On January 23, 2024, the claimants requested permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal by order dated January 23, 2025. The claimants applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on February 19, 2025. The Company opposed, and the court refused the application on February 27, 2025. 
The Company has begun its evaluation of the remaining claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time. 
U.S. Shareholder Claims
A class action lawsuit was filed against Indivior PLC, Mark Crossley (the CEO of the Company), and Ryan Preblick (the CFO of the Company) on August 2, 2024, alleging violations of certain U.S. federal securities laws. The putative class, as alleged, includes plaintiffs that purchased or otherwise acquired Indivior securities between February 22, 2024 and July 8, 2024. The court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff on October 7, 2024, and the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 5, 2024, which additionally named Richard Simkin (the CCO of the Company) as a defendant. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on January 10, 2025, which remains pending. 
The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time. 
Opiant Shareholder Claims
On November 8, 2023, plaintiff James Litten filed a class action complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that former officers and directors of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Opiant") breached fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and good faith in connection with Indivior PLC's 2022 acquisition of Opiant. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on January 26, 2024. On March 21, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on June 21, 2024. The court heard argument on the motion to dismiss on January 17, 2025 and heard additional argument on February 19, 2025. The motion remains pending. The Company has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.
Dental Allegations
The Company has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that SUBOXONE Film was defectively designed and caused dental injury, and that the Company failed to properly warn of the risks of such injuries. The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs related to these lawsuits generally can be grouped as follows:
Dental MDL Plaintiffs: Approximately 
1,300
 of these cases have been consolidated in multi-district litigation in the Northern District of Ohio. 
See In Re Suboxone (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) Film Products Liability Litigation
, MDL No. 3092 (N.D. Oh.) (the "Dental MDL").
Dental MDL Schedule A Plaintiffs: 
One
 complaint filed in the Dental MDL on June 14, 2024 attached a schedule of nearly 
10,000
 plaintiffs (the “Schedule A Plaintiffs”). The parties negotiated a tolling agreement for the Schedule A Plaintiffs that would permit plaintiffs’ counsel additional time to investigate issues such as whether and when the Schedule A Plaintiffs used any Indivior product before determining whether to file individual complaints that ultimately would be coordinated with the Dental MDL. Plaintiffs indicated to the court they will dismiss more than 
1,400
 plaintiffs in the future, pursuant to a mechanism to be provided by the court. On February 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended Schedule A that reduced the number of Schedule A claimants to 
8,623
.
State Court Plaintiffs: 
One
 complaint has been filed in New Jersey state court, and the parties have agreed to toll the claims of more than 
850
 other individuals in Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia. Complaints have not yet been filed on behalf of the tolled individuals.

Indivior PLC
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in millions)
Product liability cases such as these typically involve issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual/provable injury and other matters. These cases are in their preliminary stages. These lawsuits and claims follow a June 2022 required revision to the Prescribing Information and Patient Medication Guide about dental problems reported in connection with buprenorphine medicines dissolved in the mouth to treat opioid use disorder. This revision was required by the FDA of all manufacturers of these products. The Company has been informed by its primary insurance carrier that defense costs for the Dental MDL should begin to be reimbursed now that the Company's self-insurance retention has been exhausted. Additionally, the Company's primary insurance carrier has issued a reservation of rights against payment of any liability costs. In the event of a liability finding, various factors could affect reimbursement or payment by insurers, if any, including (i) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage, (ii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, (iii) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers and (iv) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. The Company has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.
Applications to file class actions based on similar allegations as in the Dental MDL, but also relating to SUBOXONE Tablets, were filed in Quebec and British Columbia against various subsidiaries of the Company, among other defendants, in April 2024. The Company has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss ca    n be made at this time.

 class of ordinary shares with par value of $
0.50
 per share which carries the right to 
one
 vote at general meetings of the Company. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognized as a deduction from equity. The Company does not hold any shares as treasury shares. The Company is authorized to issue an additional allotment as needed each year at the Annual General Meeting up to a maximum of an amount equivalent to two-thirds of the shares in issue (of which one-third must be offered by way of rights issue). 
On October 10, 2022, Indivior PLC completed a 5-for-1 share consolidation. Shareholders received 1 new share of ordinary shares with a nominal value of $
0.50
 each for every 5 previously existing shares of ordinary shares which had a nominal value of $
0.10
 each.
The Company does not anticipate the payment of dividends for the foreseeable future.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss
The accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Company’s foreign operations arising when the Company’s entities are consolidated.
Accumulated deficit
At the inception of Indivior as an independent publicly-listed company, accumulated deficit of $
1,295
 million was recognized, representing the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company and the net investment in the Company by the former owner.
18. Asset Acquisitions
Opiant Acquisition
On March 2, 2023, the Company acquired 
100
% of the share capital of Opiant, which at the time was a publicly traded company in the U.S., for upfront cash consideration of $
146
 million and an additional amount to be potentially paid upon achievement of net sales milestones. Opiant was a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on developing drugs for addictions and drug overdose. As a result of the acquisition, the Company added OPVEE, formerly the pipeline product OPNT003, an opioid overdose treatment well-suited to confront illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl, to its addiction treatment and science portfolio. OPVEE was approved by the FDA in May 2023 and launched in October 2023.
For the acquisition of Opiant, substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities) was concentrated in the IPR&D associated with OPVEE. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. With the closing of this transaction, a relative fair value approach was taken for allocating the purchase consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities with no goodwill recognized. The Company used a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of the IPR&D of $
120
 million, which was immediately expensed.
As part of the acquisition of Opiant, the Company agreed to provide a maximum of $
8.00
 per share in Contingent Value Rights ("CVR") post-acquisition. The Company will pay $
2.00
 per CVR for each of the following net revenue thresholds achieved by OPVEE, during any period of 
four
 consecutive quarters prior to the 
seven
th anniversary of the U.S. commercial launch: (i) $
225
 million, (ii) $
300
 million and (iii) $
325
 million. The remaining (iv) $
2.00
 per CVR would be paid if OPVEE achieves net revenue of $
250
 million during any period of 
four
 consecutive quarters prior to the third anniversary of the U.S. commercial launch. The potential undiscounted payout of contingent consideration ranges from 
zero
 to $
68
 million based on the achievement of the milestones. 
No
 liabilities were recognized as of December 31, 2023 or 2024 since the net revenue thresholds have not been reached.
The cash outflow for the acquisition was $
124
 million, net of cash acquired. Direct transaction costs of $
10
 million are included in this cash outflow and expensed as a component of acquired IPR&D. Of the $
146
 million upfront consideration, $
2
 million represents acceleration of vesting of employee share compensation and has been recognized as a post-combination expense. As part of the acquisition, the Company assumed outstanding debt of $
10
 million which was settled and included as a cash outflow from financing activities.
Additional acquisition-related costs of $
16
 million were incurred in 2023 and included in selling, general, and administrative expenses, primarily relating to severance, acceleration of vesting of Opiant employee share compensation, and short-term retention accruals.

19. Business Combinations
On November 1, 2023, the Company acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility (the "Facility") in the U.S. for upfront consideration of $
5
 million in cash and assumption of certain contract manufacturing obligations. The Facility will be further developed to secure the long-term production and supply of SUBLOCADE.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting
.
 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized as goodwill. A liability was recorded at fair value to reflect the present value of the expected losses from assumed contractual manufacturing obligations. Net operating losses attributable to these contractual obligations will be recorded against the liability from the date of acquisition through fulfillment of the contracts in early 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, committed capital spend for the Facility is approximately $
21
 million.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
As the acquisition was completed in late 2023, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition was disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2024, based on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Company adjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract provision, with a net reduction to goodwill of $
3
 million. The measurement period was closed on March 31, 2024.

20. Restructuring 
Discontinuation of PERSERIS Marketing and Promotion
In July 2024, the Company announced the discontinuation of promotion and marketing support for PERSERIS, resulting in a headcount reduction of approximately 
130
 employees and termination of related contract manufacturing agreements. The decision was taken in consideration of regulatory changes announced during Q2 2024 which are expected to adversely intensify payor management of the treatment category in which PERSERIS competes and would make PERSERIS no longer financially viable. While the Company will continue to supply PERSERIS for the foreseeable future, the expected adverse impacts represented an impairment indicator for PERSERIS-related assets, resulting in year to date impairment charges and other expenses as detailed below. Charges of $
53
 million recorded in 2024 included inventory provisions and impairment of tangible assets, contract termination costs and severance. No additional costs are expected to be incurred.

21. Subsequent Events 
In February 2025, the Company announced that Mark Crossley will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and as a Board Director by mutual agreement. Mr. Crossley is expected to remain as CEO until at least the date of the Company's annual general meeting (AGM) in May 2025. The Separation Agreement includes a 
one-year
 severance, continuation of benefits, and allows for potential vesting of all share-based compensation awards to the extent the original grant date market conditions met. These costs will be expensed in 2025.
The Company plans to appoint Joe Ciaffoni, currently an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, as the new Chief Executive Officer. The terms of his appointment are subject to, and effective upon, the approval by shareholders of a new remuneration policy at the Company's AGM in May 2025.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Indivior PLC
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15 a) 1., and the schedule of condensed financial information of the registrant as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 appearing under Item 15, of Indivior PLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company") (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
157
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Medicaid Rebate Accruals
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for rebates for governmental programs as a reduction of sales when the product is sold into the distribution channel. The Company pays rebates to individual U.S. states for all eligible units purchased under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the United States (Medicaid) based on a “per unit rebate” calculation, which is based on the Company’s average manufacturer prices and applicable supplemental agreements. Management estimates expected unit sales under Medicaid and adjusts the Company’s rebate accrual based on actual unit, per unit rebate amounts and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization. These rebates are estimated using historical and estimated payer mix, historical utilization trends and payment processing time lag. Additionally, in developing estimates, management considers statutory rebate requirements, estimated patient mix, known market events or trends, channel inventory data obtained from third parties and other pertinent internal or external information. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s accrued rebates and product returns balance was $562 million, of which a majority relates to Medicaid.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Medicaid rebate accruals is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the Medicaid rebate accruals and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to expected unit sales under Medicaid and the actual unit, per unit rebate amounts and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to Medicaid rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the Medicaid rebate accruals by utilizing third-party data related to product demand and price changes, the terms of the specific rebate programs, the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, and known market events; (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate; and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, rebate claims paid by the Company.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Indivior’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors; and

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, for more information about the Relationship Agreement.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted (i) a Global Code of Conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, and (ii) a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, copies of both of which are available on our website at www.indivior.com under the captions "About Us", "Corporate Governance", and "Global Conduct Policies". Any amendments to or waivers of the Global Code of Conduct or the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that require disclosure under applicable law or listing standards will be disclosed on our website at www.indivior.com. We undertake to provide a copy to any person, without charge, upon written request to Company Secretary, Indivior PLC, 10710 Midlothian Turnpike, Suite 125, North Chesterfield, Virginia 23235.
Shareholder Nominations for Directors
Pursuant to Indivior PLC's Memorandum and Articles of Association, shareholders may nominate any person to serve as a Director under the following conditions: The shareholder must be entitled to vote at the meeting and must deliver to the Company's office not less than seven nor more than 42 days before the day 
168
of the meeting: (a) a letter stating that the shareholder intends to nominate another person for appointment as a director; and (b) written confirmation from that person that they are willing to be appointed.
Audit & Risk Committee
The Audit & Risk Committee has responsibility for, among other things, monitoring the financial integrity of the financial statements of the Company along with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our external auditors in that process. It focuses in particular on compliance with accounting policies and ensuring that an effective system of internal financial controls is maintained. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts and other interim financial reports remains with the Board. The Audit & Risk Committee shall meet not less than four times a year to coincide with key dates in the Company’s financial reporting cycle. The Audit & Risk Committee also meets on an ad hoc basis when necessary.
The responsibilities of the Audit & Risk Committee set out in its Charter cover external audit, internal audit, financial and narrative reporting, internal controls and risk management, and the systems and procedures for detecting fraud. The Charter also sets out the authority of the Audit & Risk Committee to carry out its responsibilities.
The members of our Audit & Risk Committee are Juliet Thompson (Chair), Jo LeCouilliard, Barbara Ryan, and Mark Stejbach. Our Board has determined that each member is independent within the meaning of SEC rules and regulations and Nasdaq listing standards and possesses the required level of financial literacy as required by Nasdaq.
Audit Committee Financial Expert
SEC rules and regulations and Nasdaq listing standards require that the Audit & Risk Committee be comprised of at least three members who are all independent and possess requisite financial literacy, including at least one member who qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert.” Our Board has determined that each of Ms. Thompson and Ms. LeCouilliard qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in the SEC rules and satisfies the financial sophistication requirement of Nasdaq.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
During the year, the Board undertook a comprehensive review of its governance framework to ensure it supports the Company as it continues its transition to the requirements of a U.S.-listed domestic filer, while also meeting the requirements of an “Equity Shares (Transition)” issuer in the U.K. Pursuant to that review, effective January 1, 2025, the Board adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines which describe the principles and practices the Board will follow in carrying out its responsibilities. In addition, each Board Committee’s Terms of Reference has been replaced by a US-style Charter. To further align with U.S. practices, the Remuneration Committee changed its name to the Compensation Committee and the Senior Independent Director was re-designated the Lead Independent Director. These changes are designed to meet the governance expectations and requirements to which a U.S.-listed domestic filer is expected to adhere. The new Corporate Governance Guidelines and Board Committee Charters are available at www.indivior.com.
Board Practices
As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under Nasdaq’s rules for domestic U.S. issuers, provided that we disclose which requirements we are not following and describe the equivalent home country requirement. However, notwithstanding our ability to follow the corporate governance practices of our home country, England, in most cases we have elected to adhere to the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic registrants that are not “controlled” companies. The corporate governance practices that we follow in lieu of Nasdaq’s corporate governance rules are as follows:
•
We have established various equity compensation plans as described in Item 11 of this report, below. Under English law, subject to the provisions of a company's constitutional documents and the rules of the applicable equity compensation plan, a company with a Transition Segment 
169
Secondary Listing does not require shareholder approval to establish or materially amend an equity compensation arrangement pursuant to which stock may be acquired by officers, directors, employees, or consultants of the company. Neither the Company's Articles of Association nor the Committee Charter contain any such shareholder approval requirement. We have implemented such plans following approval by only the Company's Compensation Committee, i
n lieu of the requirement to comply with Rule 5635(c), which otherwise would require shareholder approval prior to the
 issuance of securities under such plans.
Insider Trading
 Policies
The Company has 
adopted
 a Group-Wide Dealing Policy and a Dealing Code that governs the purchase, sale, and other dispositions of the Company’s securities by directors, senior management, and employees that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and any listing standards applicable to the registrant. The Dealing Code also prohibits the pledging and hedging of Company securities. In addition, with regard to the Company’s trading in its own securities, it is the Company’s policy to comply with the federal securities laws and the applicable exchange listing requirements.

Benefits comprise the grossed-up cash value of travel and subsistence costs incurred in the normal course of business in relation to attendance at Board meetings held in the U.K. and in fulfilling the Non-Executive Director’s role, and the cost of providing professional support for the completion of U.K. tax returns for U.S. tax residents; these costs were translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate for the 2024 financial year (GB£1:U.S.$1.2782).

(1)
Mr. Preblick stepped down as an Executive Director on December 31, 2024. Mr. Preblick continues in his role as Chief Financial Officer and he remains a member of the Executive Committee.
(2)
Taxable benefits consist primarily of healthcare, car allowance, life and disability insurance, and professional support for the completion of U.S. and U.K. tax returns. Taxable benefits included a car allowance ($19,500 each for Mr. Crossley and Mr. Preblick) and premiums for medical coverage ($22,300 for Mr. Crossley and $32,800 for Mr. Preblick).
(3)
Executive Directors and Senior Managers may receive contributions into a defined contribution plan, a cash allowance, pension benefits in the form of company profit-sharing or matching contributions into the U.S. qualified 401(k) plan or a combination thereof. Mr. Crossley and Mr. Preblick received profit-sharing contributions of $13,800 (4% of eligible base salary) and matching contributions of $15,500 (75% on elected deferrals up to 4.5% of eligible base salary) to their 401(k) plan accounts. 
(4)
The maximum Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer is 200% of his base salary. The maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Financial Officer is 120% of his base salary. The maximum AIP opportunity for our Senior Managers ranges from 100% to 140% of their base salary. For our Executive Directors, the AIP is paid 75% in cash, with the remaining 25% deferred into conditional shares for two years under the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan. See “Deferred Bonus Plan 2018 (“DBP”),” beginning on page 
182
. For Senior Managers, the AIP is paid in cash. For fiscal year 2024, the Compensation Committee set stretching performance targets in the context of the business plan for 2024 and taking account of external forecasts. These targets were set by reference to the key strategic drivers for the business: global net revenues for SUBLOCADE and U.S. net revenues for PERSERIS. The targets were reviewed by the Committee at its November 2024 meeting in light of the discontinuation of PERSERIS. The PERSERIS targets were updated from full year to half year (i.e., January to June) and the weighting reduced by half. For threshold performance 12.5% of the maximum bonus would be paid, for target performance 50% of the maximum bonus would be paid, and 100% of the maximum bonus would be paid for the delivery of exceptional performance significantly above both internal and external expectations. Achievement of the performance targets is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum. In addition, an ESG metric acted as a potential modifier to the overall AIP payout by which the overall AIP payout could be reduced by up to 10% if certain ESG targets were not met during the year; all objectives under the ESG modifier were met and the Committee chose not to exercise its discretion to reduce the overall AIP payout. Overall performance resulted in a formulaic payout of 20.5% of maximum.
(5)
The value of the awards has been estimated based on the number of shares expected to vest (6,702) at the three-month average share price of Indivior shares for the last quarter of the 2024 financial year (795.5p) and converted to U.S. dollars using the average GBP/U.S.$ exchange rate over the same period (GB£1:U.S.$1.2832).
Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”)
In addition to base salary, an annual bonus opportunity exists for all employees, including the Executive Directors and Senior Managers. The maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer is 200% of his base salary. The maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Financial Officer is 120% of his base salary. The maximum AIP opportunity for our Senior Managers ranges from 100% to 140% of their base salary. For our Executive Directors (the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), the AIP is paid 75% in cash, with the remaining 25% deferred into conditional shares for two years under the Company’s Deferred 
172
Bonus Plan. See “The Deferred Bonus Plan 2018 (“DBP”),” beginning on page 
182
. For Senior Managers, the AIP is paid in cash.
Performance measures under the AIP are designed to align to the key strategic drivers for the year ahead and are developed alongside the Company’s annual financial plans. The Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes both upward and downward (including to zero) to ensure alignment of pay with the underlying performance of the Company, e.g., in the event performance is impacted by unforeseen circumstances outside Management control.
For the 2024 financial year, the Compensation Committee set stretching performance targets in the context of the business plan for 2024 and taking account of external forecasts. These targets were set by reference to the key strategic drivers for the business: global net revenues for SUBLOCADE, U.S. net revenues for PERSERIS and OPVEE, and advancement of pipeline assets. The PERSERIS targets were updated from full year to half year (i.e., January 1 to June 30) and the weighting reduced by half. For threshold performance 12.5% of the maximum bonus would be paid, for target performance 50% of the maximum bonus would be paid, and 100% of the maximum bonus would be paid for the delivery of exceptional performance significantly above both internal and external expectations. Achievement of the performance targets is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum. In addition, an ESG metric acted as a potential modifier to the overall AIP payout by which the overall AIP payout could be reduced by up to 10% if certain ESG targets were not met during the year; the Committee chose not to exercise its discretion to reduce the overall AIP payout as the relevant ESG targets were met. Overall performance resulted in a formulaic payout of 20.5% of maximum.
In line with our Remuneration Policy, 25% of the 2024 bonus payable under the AIP to the Executive Directors was automatically deferred into conditional shares under the DBP. The deferred conditional share awards vest after two years subject to continued employment as well as malus provisions.

Eligibility
The LTIP Committee may select any employee of the Company, including any Executive Director, to participate in the LTIP.
174
Awards
An award under the LTIP may take the form of:
•
a nil-cost option, which is a right to buy ordinary shares on vesting for nothing or a nominal amount;
•
a market value option, which is a right to buy ordinary shares at a price set by reference to their market value at the award date;
•
a conditional award, which is a right to receive ordinary shares on vesting; or
•
free shares, which is the receipt of ordinary shares for nothing or a nominal amount but subject to the risk of forfeiture prior to vesting.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares, the transfer of treasury shares, or by paying an equivalent amount in cash.
Awards are personal to the participant and may not be transferred except on death. No payment is required for the grant of an award.
Timing
Awards may only be granted within 42 days following: the announcement of the Company’s results for any period; the removal of any restrictions imposed on the Company which have previously prevented an award from being granted; any date on which changes to legislation or regulations affecting share plans are announced, effected, or made; or at any other time if the LTIP Committee considers that exceptional circumstances exist. No awards may be granted under the LTIP after the date of the Company's 2034 Annual General Meeting. 
Individual limit
Under the 2021 Remuneration Policy, the maximum annual award that may be made to any individual in respect of any financial year will be the lower of 300,000 ordinary shares or 400% of base salary.
Plan limits
With respect of any awards granted prior to September 30, 2024, the LTIP is subject to the limit that on any date, the aggregate nominal amount of ordinary shares that may be allocated under the LTIP may not, when added to the nominal amount of ordinary shares allocated in the previous 10 years under all employee share plans of the Company, exceed 10% of the then equity share capital of the Company. 
With respect of any awards granted on or after September 30, 2024, the aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be granted under the LTIP shall not exceed 19,000,000 ordinary shares (whether satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares, the transfer of treasury shares, or the transfer of existing ordinary shares). Any award settled in cash shall not be counted against the limit.
For these purposes, ordinary shares are treated as allocated when they are issued or transferred in satisfaction (directly or indirectly) of a person’s right under an award. No account will be taken of (i) ordinary shares acquired for a price equal to their market value at or about the date of acquisition and whose cost is borne by the employee; or (ii) an award to the extent to which the LTIP Committee considers that it will be satisfied by the transfer of existing ordinary shares other than treasury shares.
Performance conditions
Each award may, or in the case of Executive Directors of the Company must, be subject to one or more performance conditions, at least one of which must be linked to the performance of the Company, which will determine whether and to what extent the participant will receive ordinary shares. Performance conditions are normally measured over a period of three years. For Executive Directors the performance conditions are measured on one occasion only; there is no re-testing.
175
The LTIP Committee may waive or change performance conditions if events happen as a result of which the LTIP Committee reasonably considers it appropriate to make the change, provided that any changed performance conditions will not be materially easier or more difficult to satisfy.
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally only vest in accordance with the performance conditions at the end of the performance period or, if later, three years after the date of grant. Awards granted to the Executive Directors under the LTIP are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period and are then released to the Executive Director.
Each award may, to the extent that it vests, be adjusted by the LTIP Committee to include the dividends payable on the vested shares during the period starting with the date the award is granted and ending with the date on which the award vests or the option is exercised. The adjustment will be made, as the LTIP Committee may decide, either by paying an amount equal to the dividends in cash or by paying that amount in ordinary shares. Dividend equivalents will be paid to any relevant participant as soon as practicable after entitlement to the ordinary shares under the award or, in the case of an option, after exercise.
In the case of conditional awards, the ordinary shares are issued or transferred to the participant as soon as reasonably practicable upon vesting while in the case of options, the award becomes exercisable on vesting and may be exercised during the exercise period specified at the time of grant.
Alternatively, the LTIP Committee may decide to satisfy awards on vesting by a cash payment.
Malus and Clawback
Awards are granted subject to the Company's malus and clawback policies, under which the Company may clawback awards (including a reduction of the number of ordinary shares under an award and forfeiture of ordinary shares delivered) if certain trigger events (including a material misstatement of the Company's results, serious misconduct by the participant, or serious reputational damage to the Company) occur.
Termination of employment
If a participant ceases to be employed within the Company for any reason other than misconduct, he is entitled to retain any awards which have vested.
If a participant ceases to be employed within the Company, his unvested awards lapse unless he leaves for a permitted reason. A permitted reason is death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement with his employer’s agreement, the sale of the company or business in which the participant works and such other reason as the LTIP Committee may decide.
Where a participant leaves for a permitted reason and the award is subject to a performance condition, the award will vest after the end of the performance period and be released on the normal release date. Alternatively, the LTIP Committee may decide that the extent to which the award will vest will be measured in accordance with a determination of the performance conditions and other conditions at the end of the financial year in which the cessation of employment occurs. The award will also be reduced pro rata to reflect the period from the date of cessation of employment until the date of the end of the performance period as a proportion of the performance period, unless the LTIP Committee decides otherwise. 
In the case of death, the performance conditions will not apply and the award will vest and be released on the date of death, but the award will be reduced on a time pro-rated basis. If the award is not subject to performance conditions, the award will vest on the normal vesting date unless the LTIP Committee decides otherwise. Options that have already vested, or which vest following termination of employment, may be exercised within the 12 months following their release.
Change of control
Special rules apply in the event of a change of control, including a change of control resulting from a scheme of arrangement or a takeover.
176
Unless the LTIP Committee decides otherwise, awards will vest (if at all) on the date of the change of control, but only to the extent that any performance conditions have been satisfied at that date as determined by the LTIP Committee and the extent to which the award vests shall be reduced pro rata to reflect the period from the date of the event until the date of the end of the performance period as a proportion of the performance period.
In the event of a change of control, participants may or the LTIP Committee may require that participants surrender their awards in return for substitute awards over shares in the acquiring company or another company. The LTIP Committee may allow awards to vest on a similar basis in the event of a demerger or other corporate events.
Listing
So long as the ordinary shares are listed on the Official List and traded on the London Stock Exchange, the Company will apply for any new ordinary shares issued under the LTIP to be admitted to the Official List and for permission to trade in those ordinary shares. Ordinary shares issued under the LTIP will rank equally in all respects with existing ordinary shares except for any rights attaching to the ordinary shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of allotment.
Variation of Capital
On any variation of the Company’s share capital, or in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other circumstances which the LTIP Committee considers appropriate, the LTIP Committee may adjust the number or class of ordinary shares or securities comprised in an option or conditional award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Benefits non-pensionable
Benefits under the LTIP will not form part of a participant’s remuneration for pension purposes.
Amendments
The LTIP Committee may, without the approval of the Company, amend the LTIP through any minor changes to benefit the administration of the LTIP, to comply with or take account of the provisions of any proposed or existing legislation or changes to any applicable legislation, or to obtain or maintain favorable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company.
Except as described above, no amendment which is to the advantage of existing or future participants may be made, without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, to those provisions dealing with eligibility, limitations on the number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the plan, or the rights of a participant in the event of a capitalization issue, rights issue or open offer, sub-division or consolidation of shares or reduction of capital or any other variation of capital of the Company.
HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom (“HMRC”) registered options
The LTIP allows options to be granted in satisfaction of the conditions of Schedule 4 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions Act) 2003, as amended (the “ITEPA”).
U.S. Participants
The LTIP contains a part to ensure that options granted to and held by U.S. participants have an exercise price that is at least fair market value, and that conditional awards granted to and held by such U.S. participants either meet the requirements of the short-term deferral exemption to Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code 1986, as amended, or are compliant therewith.
177
Canadian Participants
The LTIP contains a part to ensure that an award made to a participant who is subject to taxation under the laws of Canada is not taxed as a “Salary Deferral Arrangement.” All awards subject thereto are administered and interpreted in a manner which complies with such intent.
The Indivior 2024 U.K. Savings Related Share Option Plan (the “Sharesave Plan”)
The Indivior U.K. Savings Related Share Option Plan (the "Expired Sharesave Plan") expired on November 30, 2024. The rules of the Expired Sharesave Plan applied to grants of options made prior to that date; the terms of the Expired Sharesave Plan are set out in 
Item 6 of 
our
 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F
 at the caption "
The Indivior Savings-Related Share Option Plan (the “Sharesave Plan”)
" which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 The current Sharesave Plan was approved by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2024, and amended by the Compensation Committee on September 30, 2024; the Sharesave Plan applies to grants of options made after May 9, 2024.
Administration
The Sharesave Plan is administered, in accordance with its rules, by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof.
Eligibility
All employees (including directors working 25 hours or more per week) who have a qualifying period (if any) of continuous service (commencing not earlier than five years prior to the Date of Grant) as the Directors may in their absolute discretion and from time to time determine of continuous service with the Company, or any subsidiary nominated to join in the Sharesave Plan, and who receive general earnings to which section 15 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 applies are eligible to participate. The Board may invite other employees of the Company to participate.
Options
Options will entitle the holder to acquire ordinary shares. Options will be personal to the participant and may not be transferred. No payment will be required for the grant of an option. No options will be granted under the Sharesave Plan after the date of the Company's 2034 Annual General Meeting.
Timing
Invitations to participate will normally be issued within 30 days (or 42 days if applications are scaled down) following: the announcement of the Company’s results for any period or its issue of any prospectus, listing particulars or other document containing equivalent information relating to the ordinary shares; a day on which an announcement is made of a new prospectus for certified SAYE (Save As You Earn) savings arrangements (within the meaning of section 703(1) of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005) for the purposes of Schedule 3 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003; a day on which an announcement is made of amendments to be made to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (so far as those changes affect savings-related share option plans approved by HMRC) or a day on which any such amendments come into force; the date of any general meeting of the Company’s shareholders; or at any other time if the Board determines that the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to justify the grant of an option. No awards may be granted under the Sharesave Plan after the date of the Company's 2034 Annual General Meeting.
Exercise price
The price payable per ordinary share on exercise of an option granted under the Sharesave Plan may not be less than an amount equal to 80% of the market value of an ordinary share (or such other percentage as shall from time to time be specified in paragraph 28(1)(b) of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax 
178
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003) or, if greater, and ordinary shares are to be acquired by subscription, the nominal value of an ordinary share.
Individual limit
Each eligible employee will be given the opportunity to apply for an option, the total exercise price of which does not exceed the aggregate of the monthly contributions made and any bonus due under the Sharesave contract to be entered into as a condition of the grant of the option. The aggregate maximum monthly contribution payable by an employee under all Sharesave contracts linked to the options granted under the Sharesave Plan may not exceed such sum as may from time to time be permitted by statute and approved by the directors.
Plan limits
With respect of any options granted prior to September 30, 2024, the aggregate nominal amount of new ordinary shares in respect of which options may be granted may not exceed 10% of the nominal amount of the equity share capital of the Company, less the total nominal amount of any new ordinary shares allocated in the previous 10 years under all employee share plans of the Company.
With respect of any options granted on or after September 30, 2024, the aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be granted under the Sharesave Plan shall not exceed 1,000,000 ordinary shares (whether satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares, the transfer of treasury shares, or the transfer of existing ordinary shares). Any option settled in cash shall not be counted against this limit.
For these purposes, allocation means the issue of new ordinary shares or the transfer of treasury shares in satisfaction (directly or indirectly) of a person’s rights under an award. No account will be taken of ordinary shares acquired by an employee where the ordinary shares are acquired for a price equal to their market value at or about the date of acquisition and the cost of those ordinary shares is borne by the employee. No account will be taken of an award if and to the extent to which the Board considers that it will be satisfied by the transfer of existing ordinary shares other than treasury shares. Any ordinary shares allocated, or remaining to be allocated, to the trustee of any trust which were used, or which are to be used, to satisfy awards granted under an employee share plan must be treated as having been allocated, or as remaining to be allocated, in respect of those awards unless the ordinary shares were acquired by the trustee pursuant to a rights issue or other opportunity offered to the trustee in respect of ordinary shares other than ordinary shares previously allocated to it. Where an award is granted in consideration of the release by the holder of an award previously granted to such holder under an employee share plan, then the earlier award is ignored and the later award is deemed to have been granted at the same time as the earlier award.
Exercise of options
Options will normally be exercisable in whole or in part during the period of six months starting on the bonus date. The bonus date is the date on which the bonus under the related Sharesave contract is payable. In normal circumstances this will be the third or fifth anniversary of the starting date of the Sharesave contract and will depend upon the election made by the participant at the time of grant.
Whenever an option is exercised, it may only be exercised with monies not exceeding the amount of the aggregate monthly contributions made and any bonus due under the related Sharesave contract.
Termination of employment
If the participant dies, his personal representatives may exercise his options in the 12 months following his death or, if earlier, the bonus date. If a participant ceases to be employed within the Company for a permitted reason, the participant may exercise his options in the six months following the termination of his employment. A permitted reason is injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, the transfer or sale outside the Company of the company or business in which the participant works or, in the case of any option which the participant has held for at least three years, where the employee does not return after maternity leave or 
179
ceases employment not by reason of dismissal for misconduct. If a participant ceases to be employed for any other reason, his option will lapse.
For these purposes, a participant will not be treated as ceasing to be employed within the Company for so long as he remains employed by a company which is an associated company of the Company.
Change of control
The exercise of options will also be permitted in the event of a change in control, a reorganization, a court-sanctioned compromise or arrangement applicable to or affecting all of the ordinary shares, a takeover offer or a voluntary winding up of the Company. In the event of a change in control of the Company, participants may surrender their options in return for substitute options over shares in the acquiring company.
Listing
Application will be made for admission to the Official List of new ordinary shares issued under the Sharesave Plan and for permission to trade in those ordinary shares. Ordinary shares issued on the exercise of options will rank equally in all respects with existing ordinary shares except for rights attaching to ordinary shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of allotment.
Variation of Capital
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company, the Board may adjust options in such manner as it determines to be appropriate.
Benefits non-pensionable
Benefits under the Sharesave Plan will not form part of a participant’s remuneration for pension purposes.
Amendments
If and for so long as the ordinary shares are admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, no amendment which is to the advantage of employees or participants may be made to those provisions dealing with eligibility, individual or Sharesave Plan limits, the basis for entitlement to and the terms of the ordinary shares or the adjustment of options without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the Sharesave Plan, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favorable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or eligible employees or for a member of the Company. Subject to the foregoing, the Board may amend the Sharesave Plan in any respect.
The Indivior U.S. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”)
The ESPP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on May 12, 2016, and amended by resolution of the Board on September 24, 2020 and by resolution of the Compensation Committee on February 14, 2023 and September 30, 2024. It is the intent of the Company to have the ESPP qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including any amendments or replacements of such section.
Administration
The ESPP is administrated by our Board or a duly authorized committee thereof.
Eligibility
All individuals who are eligible employees of the Company or participating subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the ESPP. An employee is ineligible if (i) upon enrollment in the ESPP, they would own directly or indirectly an aggregate of 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the Company or a 
180
subsidiary’s shares; (ii) they work 20 hours a week or less; or (iii) they work for five months or less of the calendar year.
Options
Under the ESPP, participants are granted options to purchase ordinary shares from the Company. As of each enrollment date, each participant is automatically granted an option to purchase a number of ordinary shares representing their savings but subject to a maximum number of ordinary shares with a market value at the date of grant of $10,000. Options may either be options to subscribe for newly-issued ordinary shares or for existing ordinary shares purchased in the market. The rights of the participant shall not be transferable. No option shall be granted under the ESPP after the date as of which the ESPP is terminated by the Board in accordance with the termination provisions or, in any event after, the tenth anniversary of the ESPP’s approval by the Company’s shareholders.
Timing
Participation in the ESPP is voluntary. Eligible employees who meet the specified requirements are able to enroll in the ESPP on the first day of each six-month period commencing with the first regular payroll period on or after each successive January 1 or July 1 (each an “Accumulation Period”). Any eligible employee may consent to enrollment in the ESPP by completing and signing an enrollment form (which authorizes the payroll deductions).
Exercise Price
The exercise price shall be eighty-five percent (85%) of the lower of (i) the fair market value of an ordinary share on the enrollment date on which the option is granted; or (ii) the fair market value of an ordinary share on the purchase date but, in the case of newly issued ordinary shares, not lower than the par value of an ordinary share. The Board may establish a different purchase price, though it may not be less than (i) the purchase price set forth above and (ii) in the case of newly issued ordinary shares, than the par value per ordinary share. Also, in such case, the Board must determine such different purchase price at least thirty (30) days prior to the Accumulation Period for which it is applicable.
Payroll Deductions
To participate in the ESPP, eligible employees must elect and authorize to have deductions made from their pay on each payday during the Accumulation Period to which the enrollment form relates. Each participant designates a percentage of their base earnings to be deducted. The minimum deduction is one percent (1%) and the maximum is ten percent (10%), of base earnings per Accumulation Period. 
Plan limits
The number of ordinary shares reserved under the ESPP is 25,000,000. With respect of any options granted prior to September 30, 2024, the ESPP will be subject to the limit that on any date, the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued (or treasury shares transferred) under the ESPP may not, when added to the number of new ordinary shares allocated in the previous 10 years under all employee share plans of the Company, exceed 10% of the equity share capital of the Company in issue at that time.
Exercise of awards
An award will normally be deemed to have been exercised on the specific trading day during an Accumulation Period on which ordinary shares are purchased under the ESPP. For each Accumulation Period, the purchase date is the last trading day occurring in such Accumulation Period. Whenever an award is exercised it will be for the number of ordinary shares (including partial or fractional shares) which the funds accumulated in their account at such purchase date will purchase at the applicable purchase price.
181
Termination of employment
Participation in the ESPP terminates immediately when a participant ceases to be employed with the Company or a participating subsidiary for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, or on account of death, disability or retirement, or if the participating subsidiary employing the participant ceases to be a participating subsidiary. As soon as administratively practicable after termination, the Company shall pay the participant or legal representative all amounts accumulated in the participant’s account.
Change of Control
A participant’s accumulated savings at the relevant date will be used to exercise their options under the ESPP in the event of a change of control, takeover offer, scheme of arrangement or winding up of the Company.
Listing
Application will be made for admission to the Official List of any new ordinary shares issued under the ESPP and for permission to trade in those ordinary shares. Ordinary shares issued on the exercise of options will rank equally in all respects with existing ordinary shares except for rights attaching to ordinary shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of allotment.
Variation of Capital
In the event of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or shares, separation, asset spin-off, stock rights offering, liquidation or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company, the Board shall make such adjustment, if any, as it deems appropriate in the number, kind and purchase price of the ordinary shares available for purchase under the ESPP. In the event of liquidation of the Company, each option to purchase ordinary shares shall terminate but the participant holding such an option shall have the right to exercise their option prior to such termination.
Benefits non-pensionable
Benefits under the ESPP do not form part of a participant’s remuneration for pension purposes.
Amendments
The Board may amend or modify the ESPP at any time, provided that no amendment that would amend to the advantage of participants (i) the definition of eligible employees entitled to participate in the ESPP, (ii) the maximum number of ordinary shares reserved for sale and issuance under the ESPP, (iii) the number, kind and purchase price of the ordinary shares available for purchase in order to permit the enlargement of a participant’s rights under the ESPP, (iv) the maximum fair market value option amount that a participant may be granted in a calendar year under the ESPP, or (v) the requirements of any securities exchange on which the ordinary shares are traded unless in each case it has been authorized by shareholders of the Company in a general meeting. The committee authorized to administer the ESPP may, without such approval, make minor amendments to benefit the administration of the ESPP, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favorable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants in the ESPP or for the Company. Subject to the preceding paragraph, the committee authorized to administer the ESPP shall have the power to amend the ESPP and perform such acts as it deems necessary to promote the best interests of the Company.
The Indivior Deferred Bonus Plan 2018 (the “DBP”)
In line with our Remuneration Policy, the DBP requires the Executive Directors to defer 25% of their annual bonus in the form of ordinary shares of the Company for a period of time. The DBP was adopted by the Board on July 19, 2018, and subsequently amended on November 19, 2018, February 14, 2023, and September 30, 2024. The DBP only applies to Executive Directors (the Chief Executive Officer and, until 
182
December 31, 2024, the Chief Financial Officer). The DBP is intended to comply with section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Administration of the DBP
The DBP is administered, in accordance with its rules, by the Compensation Committee or another duly authorized committee of the Board (the “DBP Committee”).
Eligibility
The DBP Committee may grant an award under the DBP to any employee (including an Executive Director) who was a participant in any annual bonus plan operated by the Company during the financial year immediately preceding the proposed date of grant as a means of deferring part of that employee’s annual bonus into ordinary shares of the Company.
Awards
Awards may be granted in the form of (i) options to acquire ordinary shares of the Company, (ii) conditional share awards or (iii) phantom shares awards, in each case as the DBP Committee may determine in its absolute discretion. Prior to granting an award, the DBP Committee shall determine the number of ordinary shares or notional shares subject to an award where the market value of such ordinary shares or notional shares, as applicable, shall not exceed 25% (or such other percentage as the DBP Committee may determine) of the individual’s annual bonus. 
Timing
Awards may only be granted within 42 days commencing on the day immediately after the announcement of the Company’s results for any period or the day on which the DBP Committee considers that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the grant of awards. 
Vesting of awards
Awards will typically vest after a period of two years from the date of grant or such other period or periods as the DBP Committee considers appropriate. Ordinary shares transferred under the DBP will rank equally in all respects with existing ordinary shares then in issue except for any rights attaching to such ordinary shares by reference to a record date before the date of such transfer.
The DBP includes a clawback provision under which the DBP Committee may reduce awards, recover awards or make certain other adjustments to awards if (and in respect of vested awards only, before the second anniversary of such award’s vesting date) the DBP Committee determines in its absolute discretion that there was a material misstatement of the Company’s results for any financial year before an award was granted, there was serious misconduct by the participant, or at any time during or after any financial year before an award was granted there was serious reputational damage to any member of the Company. 
Termination of employment
If, prior to an award vesting, a participant ceases to be employed within the Company due to voluntary resignation, misconduct or the Company becomes aware of facts or circumstances that would have entitled it to dismiss the participant for misconduct, such participant’s unvested awards shall lapse. If, prior to an award vesting, a participant ceases to be employed within the Company for any other reason, then such participant’s unvested award shall continue subject to the rules of DBP. 
Change of control
Special rules apply in the event of a change of control, including a change of control resulting from a scheme of arrangement pursuant to the Companies Act or a takeover. Unless the DBP Committee decides otherwise, awards will vest on the date of the relevant event.
183
The DBP Committee may determine that participants may surrender their awards in return for substitute awards over shares in the acquiring company or another company. The DBP Committee may allow awards to vest on a similar basis in the event of a voluntary winding-up of the Company.
Dividends
Subject to the determination of the DBP Committee, participants shall be entitled on the vesting of any award either (a) to be paid a cash amount equal to the dividend that the participant would have accrued had the participant held the number of ordinary shares under the award from the date of grant until the vesting date or (b) to receive an additional number of ordinary shares that could have been acquired with the amount of cash dividends payable on the ordinary shares under the award.
Variation of Capital
On any variation of the Company’s share capital, such as a rights issue, super dividend, demerger, dividend in specie or any capitalization issue or other similar event, awards may be adjusted in such manner as the DBP Committee considers appropriate. If any such event, in the opinion of the DBP Committee, would materially affect the value of an award, the DBP Committee may permit awards to vest on or prior to the date of such event. 
Amendments
The DBP Committee may amend the DBP from time to time. However, except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the DBP, to take account of changes in law, tax or regulatory treatment or to take account of local laws where participants are situated, no amendment that would adversely and materially affect the existing rights of a participant may be made unless with the written consent of the participant or a majority of the participants affected by the amendment.
Indivior PLC Employee Benefit Trust
In 2016, we established an employee benefit trust with an independent trustee, based in Jersey, Channel Islands, to purchase and hold shares in Indivior to be used to satisfy awards and/or options granted to eligible employees under our share plans established from time to time.
The trustee has waived its rights to receive dividends on any shares that it holds. The employee benefit trust held 100,210 ordinary shares and Depositary Interests as at January 31, 2025. 
Indivior Inc. Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”)
The 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan and is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The purpose of the 401(k) Plan is to enable eligible employees to save for retirement. As well as retirement benefits, the 401(k) Plan provides certain benefits in the event of death, disability, or other termination of employment. The 401(k) Plan is for the exclusive benefit of eligible employees and their beneficiaries. 
Eligible employees may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible compensation into the 401(k) Plan, and the Company will match 75% of the first 6% of an eligible employee’s contributions. Additionally, the Company automatically contributes an amount equal to 4% of an eligible employee’s eligible compensation to the employee’s 401(k) Plan, representing a profit-sharing contribution.
Indivior Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”) 
We maintain a Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”) that provides a select group of Management and other highly compensated employees in the U.S., including Executive Directors and Senior Managers, as determined by the committee administering the DCP, with an opportunity to defer the receipt of portions of their compensation. The DCP is intended to comply with section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The DCP allows highly compensated employees who are unable, due to limits that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) imposes on 401(k) plans, to save a proportionate amount of their eligible compensation for retirement within the 401(k) Plan, to defer compensation in excess of IRS limits.
184
Under our DCP, for each financial year, participants may elect to defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of their bonus. Employees hired before January 1, 2011 are eligible for a Company match on 401(k) deferrals in excess of the annual IRS limit up to 4.5% of eligible compensation. Amounts contributed to the DCP are invested in one or more investment options as elected by a participant or absent such election, the committee administering the DCP. Participants can elect to have the benefits associated with compensation deferred in a financial year paid on June 1 of a year at least two financial years after the financial year in which such compensation was deferred. Otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions, benefits under the DCP are paid in a lump sum or in a fixed amount annually over a period not to exceed 10 years starting 60 days (or for certain employees, six months) after termination of employment of the participant.
Deeds of Indemnity
The Company also entered into a deed poll of indemnity (the “Deed Poll”) on November 5, 2014 for the benefit of the officers, directors, company secretary or any position equivalent to any of the foregoing (“Beneficiaries”) of the Company or any body corporate that is a group undertaking of the Company (“Group Company”). Under the Deed Poll, the Company undertakes to indemnify each Beneficiary against any and all liability suffered or incurred by that Beneficiary in respect of that Beneficiary’s acts or omissions while, or in the course of acting or purporting to act as, an officer of any Group Company or which otherwise arises by virtue of that Beneficiary holding or having held such position, in each case, to the extent arising out of or in connection with, directly or indirectly, any investigation, demand, claim, action or proceeding brought or threatened against that Beneficiary or any other person in any jurisdiction.
The Deed Poll does not extend to any liability incurred by the Beneficiary (1) to pay a fine imposed in criminal proceedings, (2) to pay a sum payable to a regulatory authority by way of a penalty in respect of non-compliance with any requirement of a regulatory nature, (3) in defending any criminal proceedings in which the Beneficiary is convicted, (4) in defending civil proceedings brought by the Company, in which judgment is given against the Beneficiary, or (5) in connection with an application for relief in which the court refuses to grant the Beneficiary relief. The Deed Poll also does not apply to the extent that the Beneficiary has been indemnified or reimbursed by any other insurance, where there has been gross negligence, fraud or willful default by the Beneficiary or where the Beneficiary has improperly derived a personal benefit or profit.
The Company may advance such funds to a Beneficiary as the Company, in its reasonable discretion, considers appropriate for the Beneficiary to meet expenditures incurred in defending any criminal or civil proceedings in connection with any alleged negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the Beneficiary or in defending himself in an investigation by a regulatory authority or against action proposed to be taken by a regulatory authority in connection with any alleged negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the Beneficiary.
The Deed Poll also provide that the Company will use reasonable endeavors to purchase and maintain insurance cover for directors’ and officers’ liabilities on reasonable commercial terms in respect of each Beneficiary for so long as the Beneficiary is a director or employee of any Group Company and for at least six years thereafter.
Malus and Clawback
The Compensation Committee has the discretion to scale back or cancel LTIP awards, extend the performance period or defer the exercise period prior to the satisfaction of awards or after the end of any relevant holding period in the event that results are materially misstated for part of the performance period applicable to an award, an individual’s conduct has amounted to gross misconduct or in the event of serious reputational damage to Indivior. Where LTIP awards have vested, the Committee has the discretion to “claw back” awards or reduce amounts of other payments due to the individual up to the fifth anniversary of the grant of awards in the circumstances described above.
185
Indivior PLC Executive Compensation Clawback Policy 
The Company's Executive Compensation Policy forms part of its Malus & Clawback policy, adopted during the year. The policy requires Indivior to recover incentive based compensation if (i) there is a restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws, or that would result in a material misstatement if not corrected for prior periods; and (ii) a covered executive has received incentive-based compensation in excess of what they should have received if such compensation was instead calculated using the corrected Company financial statements.
Executive Financial Recoupment Program 
As part of the Company’s Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an Executive Financial Recoupment Program was implemented (the “Recoupment Program”). Under the terms of the Recoupment Program, up to two years of performance pay may be put at risk of forfeiture and/or recoupment for certain U.S.-based executives (which includes both serving Executive Directors). 
Forfeiture and/or recoupment may be applied in the event that it is determined that there has been a “Triggering Event”; a Triggering Event includes significant misconduct (violation of law or regulation or a significant violation of an Indivior policy) related to covered activities, or, significant misconduct related to covered activities by subordinate employees in the business unit for which the relevant executive had responsibility that is not an isolated incident and which the relevant executive knew or should have known was occurring. 
Forfeiture and/or recoupment under the Recoupment Program may be applied to awards granted after November 20, 2020 and will cease to apply to awards on July 24, 2025 or the date on which the Company’s obligations under the Corporate Integrity Agreement expire (if later).

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
The Audit & Risk Committee has adopted a Related Party Transactions Policy (the “RPT Policy”), which provides the procedures for the review, approval, and ratification of related party transactions, and which governs the Company’s accounting, disclosure, and reporting of related party transactions. Under the RPT Policy, a 'related party' is any entity or person over which the Company exercises control, common control, joint control, or significant influence; any Person Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (“PDMR”), including Directors and members of the Executive Committee; any director nominee; shadow director; beneficial owner of more the 5% of the Company’s voting securities; or any immediate family member of one of the foregoing persons. A 'related party transaction' is any financial transaction, arrangement, or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness), or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships in which the Company (and/or any of its consolidated subsidiaries) is or was a participant and in which a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest, where the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 in any fiscal year or $100,000 in aggregate.
The Audit & Risk Committee conducts a reasonable prior review of all related party transactions and considers the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether to approve, ratify, revise, or terminate a related party transaction. The Audit & Risk Committee approves only those transactions that are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, the Company has had no transactions with related persons requiring approval under the Company's RPT Policy or disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, except for Relationship Agreements with Scopia and the Oaktree Parties, as described below.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the Register of Directors' Conflicts of Interest, as well as reviewing and evaluating additional external appointments for the Directors of Indivior PLC and members of the Executive Committee, and making recommendations to the Board.
The Nomination Committee is also responsible for considering the independence of the Non-Executive Directors and their other commitments and if these are likely to give rise to a potential conflict of interest. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Board confirmed that each of the Non-Executive Directors, following the retirement of Jerome Lande, remained independent. 
Relationship Agreement with Scopia Capital Management
The Company entered into an agreement titled Relationship Agreement with Scopia Capital Management LP (“Scopia”) on March 24, 2021 (as further amended on July 7, 2022, April 26, 2023, and November 17, 2023, the “Relationship Agreement”). In recognition of Scopia’s ownership of approximately 16.9% of the Company’s shares as at March 24, 2021, the Company agreed to appoint Jerome Lande as a Representative Director. Scopia agreed to certain standstill provisions (for example to vote on ordinary course resolutions in accordance with the Board’s recommendation). The parties further agreed that Scopia would not exercise voting rights in excess of 15% of the outstanding shares. The Relationship Agreement terminated on December 31, 2024 and Mr. Lande has resigned from the Board.
Relationship Agreement with the Oaktree Parties
On December 16, 2024, Indivior PLC entered into a Relationship Agreement with Oaktree Value Opportunities Fund, L.P., Oaktree London Liquid Value Opportunities Fund (VOF), L.P., Oaktree Phoenix Investment Fund, L.P. and Boston Patriot Arlington ST LLC (together, the "Oaktree Parties") pursuant to which Indivior PLC agreed to (i) appoint Robert Schriesheim, Joe Ciaffoni, and Daniel Ninivaggi (together, the "New NEDs") to the Board, (ii) appoint the New NEDs as members of the Nomination Committee and the Operational Committee of the Board, and (iii) from January 1, 2025 until the expiry of the Relationship Agreement have a maximum of 11 directors on the Board. Indivior PLC also agreed that the Board will unanimously recommend to shareholders the re-appointment of the New NEDs to the Board at the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Indivior PLC.
190
The Relationship Agreement further provides that, until the expiration of the Relationship Agreement, the Oaktree Parties will not, and will take reasonable steps to ensure that each of their affiliates will not, (i) remove or publicly propose the removal of any member of the Board, (ii) put forward or propose any resolution, agenda item or amendment thereto at a general meeting of Indivior PLC, (iii) nominate any person to the Board, (iv) require the Board to call a general meeting of Indivior PLC, (v) require circulation of a statement relating to a proposed resolution or any other business to be dealt with at a general meeting of the Company, (vi) make any public proposal to change (a) the Board or management, (b) the capitalization or capital allocation program and practices of Indivior PLC, or (c) Indivior PLC's business or corporate structure, or (vii) vote against the recommendation of the Board on any Ordinary Course Resolution, or solicit or knowingly urge any shareholder of Indivior PLC to take the foregoing actions. The Relationship Agreement also contains mutual non-disparagement and no litigation covenants.
The Relationship Agreement will terminate on December 31, 2025, provided that the Oaktree Parties may terminate the Relationship Agreement earlier if Indivior PLC breaches certain provisions of the Relationship Agreement. The foregoing description of the Relationship Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Relationship Agreement, which is filed as
 Exhibit 10.13 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Indivior PLC
Schedule I
(Dollars in millions)
Parent Company Information
Cash dividends and/or share repurchase programs, if any, are made by Indivior PLC (the “Parent Company”). The Parent Company’s primary source of income and cash flow is dividends and loans from its subsidiaries, which are restricted by our note purchase agreement (see 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 12. Debt
).
 The Note Purchase Agreement 
contains customary negative covenants limiting these subsidiaries' ability to dividends, loans and other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions and baskets. The stand-alone condensed financial statements of the Parent Company are presented below in accordance with SEC regulations when such restrictions exist. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

Any material contingencies, long-term obligations and guarantees have been separately disclosed in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. These condensed parent company financial statements are not the general-purpose financial statements of the reporting entity. These condensed financial statements of the Parent Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Indivior PLC and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) and the notes thereto included in 
Item 8
.
 Financial Statements—Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
. These financial statements have been provided to comply with Rule 4-08(e) of Regulation S-X.
Use of Estimates
The use of estimates is inherent in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(2) Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information 
The Parent Company receives dividends from its subsidiaries primarily to repurchase common stock and fund its operating costs. During the periods presented, the dividends received were in excess of current year equity in subsidiary earnings, and thus was considered to be a return of investment and is classified as a cash inflow from investing activities.
