Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely targeted therapies for patients with cancer. We leverage our team’s deep expertise in chemistry and structure-based drug design to develop innovative small molecules that are designed with the aim to overcome the limitations of existing therapies for clinically proven kinase targets.

Limitations faced by currently available kinase inhibitors can include (i) kinase resistance, or the emergence of new mutations in the kinase target that can enable resistance to existing therapies, (ii) kinase selectivity, or the potential for existing therapies to inhibit other structurally similar kinase targets and lead to off-target adverse events, and (iii) limited brain penetrance, or the ability for the therapy to treat disease that has spread or metastasized to the brain. By prioritizing target selectivity, we believe our drug candidates have the potential to overcome resistance, avoid dose-limiting off-target adverse events, address brain metastases, and drive more durable responses. This may result in the potential to drive deeper, more durable responses with minimal adverse events, and we believe these potential benefits may support opportunities for clinical utility earlier in the treatment paradigm.

Candidate Overview

Zidesamtinib (NVL-520)

Our first lead product candidate, zidesamtinib (NVL-520), is being developed for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. Zidesamtinib is a novel ROS1-selective inhibitor designed with the aim to address the clinical challenges of emergent treatment resistance, CNS-related adverse events, and brain metastases that may limit the use of currently available ROS1 TKIs. Zidesamtinib has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who have previously been treated with two or more prior ROS1 TKIs, and orphan drug designation for ROS1-positive NSCLC.

Our ARROS-1 clinical trial is a first-in-human Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating zidesamtinib as an oral monotherapy in patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors. Dosing was initiated in the Phase 1 portion of the ARROS-1 clinical trial in January 2022. From January 2022 to August 2023, the Phase 1 portion of the ARROS-1 trial enrolled 104 patients (99 NSCLC, 5 other solid tumors).

In September 2023, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2 portion of the ARROS-1 clinical trial, following alignment with the FDA on a RP2D of 100 mg QD. The Phase 2 portion of the ARROS-1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of zidesamtinib in patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors, examining several specific cohorts of patients based on the prior anti-cancer therapies that such patients have received. Phase 2 cohorts have been designed to support potential registration in TKI-naïve and/or TKI pre-treated ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.

At the ESMO Congress in September 2024, we presented updated data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the ARROS-1 clinical trial based on a data cut-off date on July 1, 2024. Data presented showed that treatment with zidesamtinib resulted in durable clinical responses in heavily pre-treated patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC, including in subgroups of patients who had likely exhausted all available therapies, including lorlatinib and/or repotrectinib, had a history of brain metastases, or had the G2032R resistance mutation. Additionally, zidesamtinib was well-tolerated with a preliminary safety profile that was favorable and consistent with its ROS1-selective, TRK-sparing design.

Between September 2023 and December 31, 2024, 326 patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the ARROS-1 clinical trial. We periodically review data from the ARROS-1 clinical trial to provide progress updates on the trial’s status and to form the basis for engagement with the FDA on, among other things, the appropriate amount of information that may be sufficient to support an NDA submission. We expect to report topline pivotal data for TKI pre-treated patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC in the first half of 2025 in support of an anticipated NDA submission by mid-year 2025, with an initial target indication of TKI pre-treated patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC. We plan to continue engagement with the FDA on accelerated opportunities towards a potential line-agnostic indication supported by the ongoing TKI-naïve cohort in the Phase 2 portion of the ARROS-1 trial.

Neladalkib (NVL-655)

Our second lead product candidate, neladalkib (NVL-655), is being developed for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Neladalkib is a brain-penetrant ALK-selective inhibitor designed with the aim to address the clinical challenges of emergent treatment resistance, CNS-related adverse events, and brain metastases that may limit the use of first-generation (1G; crizotinib), second-generation (2G;

94

Table of Contents

ceritinib, alectinib, or brigatinib), and third-generation (3G; lorlatinib) ALK inhibitors. Neladalkib has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who have been previously treated with two or more ALK TKIs, and orphan drug designation for ALK-positive NSCLC.

Our ALKOVE-1 clinical trial is a first-in-human Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating neladalkib as an oral monotherapy in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors. Dosing was initiated in the Phase 1 portion of the ALKOVE-1 clinical trial in June 2022. From June 2022 to February 2024, the Phase 1 portion of the ALKOVE-1 trial enrolled 133 patients (131 NSCLC, 2 other solid tumors).

In February 2024, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2 portion of the ALKOVE-1 clinical trial, following alignment with the FDA on a RP2D of 150 mg QD. The Phase 2 portion of the ALKOVE-1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of neladalkib in several expansion cohorts of patients defined based on the number and type of prior anti-cancer therapies they have received. The Phase 2 cohorts are designed with registrational intent for TKI pre-treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and to enable preliminary evaluation for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who are TKI-naïve.

At the ESMO Congress in September 2024, we presented updated data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the ALKOVE-1 clinical trial, based on a data cut-off date of June 15, 2024. Data presented showed that treatment with neladalkib resulted in durable clinical responses in heavily pre-treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, including in subgroups of patients who had likely exhausted all available therapies, including lorlatinib, had a history of brain metastases, or had single or compound ALK resistance mutations. Additionally, neladalkib demonstrated a favorable preliminary safety profile consistent with its ALK-selective, TRK-sparing design.

Between February 2024 and December 31, 2024, 463 patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the ALKOVE-1 clinical trial. We expect to report pivotal data for TKI pre-treated patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC by year-end 2025.

We believe that the previously presented data in heavily pre-treated patients could have the potential to translate to deep, durable responses in the front-line setting. In the first half of 2025, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the ALKAZAR trial, with registrational intent for TKI-naïve patients. The ALKAZAR trial will be a global, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate neladalkib versus the current standard of care for the treatment of patients with TKI-naïve ALK-positive NSCLC. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive neladalkib monotherapy or ALECENSA
®
 (alectinib) monotherapy, reflecting input from collaborating physician-scientists and alignment with the FDA. The ALKAZAR trial is designed to enroll approximately 450 patients with TKI-naïve ALK-positive NSCLC. The primary endpoint is PFS based on BICR. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS based on investigator’s assessment, time to intracranial response, and BICR assessment of IC-ORR, IC-DOR, ORR, DOR, time to intracranial progression, and safety.

NVL-330

Our third product candidate, NVL-330, is a brain-penetrant HER2-selective inhibitor designed with the aim to address the combined medical need of treating tumors driven by HER2ex20, treating brain metastases, and avoiding treatment-limiting adverse events including due to off-target inhibition of wild-type EGFR. Preclinical data have shown that NVL-330 inhibited a broad range of HER2 oncogenic alterations, including HER2ex20, in cell-based assays, was brain penetrant and was selective for HER2 oncogenic alterations over the structurally related wild-type EGFR.

We are currently enrolling patients in the HEROEX-1 clinical trial, a Phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion trial evaluating NVL-330 in pre-treated patients with advanced HER2-altered NSCLC, including those with HER2ex20 mutations. In July 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed with NVL-330 in the HEROEX-1 trial. The HEROEX-1 trial is evaluating the overall safety and tolerability of NVL-330. Additional objectives include determination of the RP2D, characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor activity.

Discovery Programs

We have prioritized a number of additional small molecule research programs following an assessment of medical need. Research for these programs is ongoing.

Financial Overview

Since commencing significant operations in 2018, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on research and development activities for our programs, including zidesamtinib, neladalkib and NVL-330, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, preparing for potential commercialization and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated revenue from product sales or any other source.

We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. We reported net losses of $260.8 million, $126.2 million, and $81.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $547.1 million. We expect to incur significant expenses at

95

Table of Contents

an increasing rate and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:

•
continue to advance zidesamtinib, neladalkib and NVL-330 in clinical development;

•
advance the development of our discovery programs; 

•
expand our pipeline of product candidates through our product discovery and development efforts;

•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;

•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates and incur related additional commercial manufacturing costs;

•
implement operational, financial and management systems;

•
attract, hire and retain additional clinical, scientific, management and administrative personnel;

•
maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know how;

•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and

•
operate as a public company.

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capabilities to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

As a result, we may need additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S., including disruptions to, and instability and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide, including heightened inflation, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession as well as concerns related to public health emergencies, natural disasters or geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest or military conflicts. In addition, market instability and volatility, high levels of inflation and interest rate fluctuations may increase our cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of future liquidity. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to have to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our development efforts.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.1 billion. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be sufficient to fund all of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we may need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. See 
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Components of Our Results of Operations

Operating expenses

Our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:

96

Table of Contents

•
personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions;

•
expenses incurred in connection with our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and CROs; and

•
the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug substance and drug product for use in our research and preclinical and clinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and CMOs.

We track our direct external research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. These consist of costs that include fees, reimbursed materials, and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities. Costs incurred prior to nominating a development candidate are included in discovery programs. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, and facilities expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified.

We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we continue to advance zidesamtinib, neladalkib, and NVL-330 in clinical development, and expand our discovery, research and preclinical activities in the near term and in the future. Although the Phase 2 portions of our ARROS-1 and ALKOVE-1 clinical trials and the HEROEX-1 Phase 1a clinical trial are ongoing and we plan to initiate the ALKAZAR Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2025, at this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop. A change in the outcome of any number of variables with respect to product candidates we may develop could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:

•
the timing and progress of development activities relating to zidesamtinib, neladalkib, NVL-330 and any future product candidates from our discovery programs, including any additional costs that may result from delays in enrollment or other factors; 

•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;

•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;

•
successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;

•
the number of trials required for regulatory approval;

•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;

•
the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects and initiate clinical trials;

•
the number of subjects that participate in the trials and per subject trial costs;

•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory authorities;

•
the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;

•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to applicable regulatory authorities;

•
the receipt of approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals and post-marketing approval commitments from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
the extent to which we establish collaborations, strategic partnerships or other strategic arrangements with third parties, if any, and the performance of any such third party;

•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with CMOs;

•
development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch; and

•
obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.

Any changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of our product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience

97

Table of Contents

significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations and accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount and continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.

Other income (expense)

Change in fair value of related party revenue share liability

We have a revenue sharing agreement with Deerfield, an investor in the company, to pay Deerfield a fixed low single-digit percentage rate of net sales of certain commercial products. We account for the liability to Deerfield at fair value with changes recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Interest income and other income (expense), net

Interest income and other income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and other income (expense) unrelated to our core operations.

Change in fair value of related party revenue share liability

The change in fair value of the related party revenue share liability for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $17.9 million, due to changes in certain assumptions related to the probability of product approval and the timing thereof, as well as changes in certain assumptions underlying the related sales projections. There was de minimis change in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Interest income and other income (expense), net

Interest income and other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, consisted primarily of interest income of $38.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales for several years, if at all. Through December 31, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible notes, debt financing from

99

Table of Contents

stockholders and proceeds from the sale of common stock in our public offerings. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.1 billion and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $54.0 million.

In September 2024, we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of our Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $100.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $540.0 million, after deducting equity issuance costs and underwriting discounts and commissions.

In August 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement (as amended, the Sales Agreement) with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen) under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million through Cowen as our Sales Agent (the ATM Facility). We will pay Cowen a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds of any shares of Class A common stock sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement. In October 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Sales Agreement with Cowen (the Sales Agreement Amendment). The Sales Agreement Amendment was effective immediately and reduced the maximum aggregate offering price of the Class A common stock that we may sell under the ATM Facility to $135.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, we have not sold any shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.

The following discussion and analysis of a summary of our cash flows includes a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Operating activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $185.1 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $260.8 million adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $60.6 million, change in fair value of related party revenue share liability of $17.9 million and net accretion on marketable securities of $14.7 million, and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.8 million. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to increased clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support the development of our product candidates and increased personnel-related expenses due to the growth of our company, partially offset by increased interest income due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase in accrued expenses of $26.9 million, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.6 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $4.0 million, and an increase in other assets of $3.4 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $99.7 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $126.2 million adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation of $25.6 million and net accretion on marketable securities of $10.1 million, and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.0 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $11.8 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $1.4 million.

Changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other assets were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research and development programs and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.

Investing activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $573.5 million, due to purchases of marketable securities of $1.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $450.5 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $143.5 million, due to purchases of marketable securities of $459.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $313.0 million.

Financing activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $568.9 million, primarily due to proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $540.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $28.8 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $336.8 million, primarily due to proceeds from a follow-on public offering of $324.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $13.8 million.

Funding Requirements

We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical and clinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates in development and any product candidates we may discover and develop in the future. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:

•
the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our discovery programs and product candidates, including the advancement of zidesamtinib, neladalkib and NVL-330 throughout clinical development;

•
the clinical development plans we establish for our product candidates, including zidesamtinib, neladalkib and NVL-330;

•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover and develop through our product discovery and research efforts;

•
the terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to pursue;

•
the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;

•
the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;

•
the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us;

•
the effect of competing technological and market developments;

•
the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; and

•
the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.1 billion. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be sufficient to fund all of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we may need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our operations does not include potential product revenue and is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including those listed above.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

We have obligations under revenue sharing agreements with Deerfield and our scientific founder to pay each of Deerfield and our scientific founder a fixed low single-digit percentage rate of net sales of certain commercial products. See Note 10 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our obligations under the revenue sharing agreements. We lease office space for our corporate headquarters, which is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with our CMOs, CROs and other third parties to support preclinical research studies and other research and development activities. These contracts are generally terminable by us for convenience or for breach after reasonable cure periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Accrued research and development expenses

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include activities with vendors in connection with preclinical development activities, CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies and testing and CMOs in connection with the process development and scale up activities and the production of materials.

We base the expense recorded related to contract research and manufacturing on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to the terms of the individual agreements with the CROs and CMOs that conduct services and supply materials. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. While the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met, some require advance payments. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. We record these as prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-based compensation

We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation 
(ASC 718). We have issued stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). In accordance with ASC 718, we recognize stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on a stock-based award’s grant date fair value.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. For RSUs, the fair value of an RSU is equal to the market price of a share of our Class A common stock on the grant date. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense for our stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value

102

Table of Contents

over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Stock-based awards generally vest over three- or four-year service periods and stock options expire after ten years.

We record stock-based compensation expense to research and development expense or general and administrative expense based on the underlying function of the individual that was granted the stock-based compensation award. Shares issued upon stock option exercise and RSU vesting are newly-issued shares.

The assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options are as follows:

Expected Term
 — As we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term, we utilize the “simplified” method, as prescribed in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetical average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the stock option.

Expected Volatility
 — The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our Company and that of similar entities within our industry for periods corresponding with the expected term of the grant.

Risk-Free Interest Rate
 — The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period that corresponds with the expected term of the grant.

Expected Dividends
 — The expected dividend yield is 0% as we have not historically paid, and do not expect for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend on our common stock.

The assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model are inherently subjective and represent management’s best estimates. These assumptions involve a number of variables, uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If any assumptions change, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

Stock-based compensation expense was $60.6 million, $25.6 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $144.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

Related party revenue share liability

We account for the related party revenue share liability with Deerfield at fair value. The revenue sharing agreement with Deerfield obligates us to pay a fixed low single-digit percentage rate of net sales of certain commercial products. In accordance with FASB ASC 825, 
Financial Instruments
, we elected the fair value option. Each reporting period, we remeasure the liability to estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model based on the most recent assumptions related to the probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues and discount rate. The estimated fair value as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was determined to be $17.9 million and de minimis, respectively. Changes in fair value each reporting period are recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We have not recorded any net sales and, as a result, have not paid any amounts under this obligation.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities related to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had $145.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $972.6 million in marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities. We invest our excess cash in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government and agency securities and U.S. treasury bills. We mitigate credit risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio, placing our cash with high credit quality financial institutions and limiting the amount of investment exposure as to maturity and investment type according to our investment policy. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.

Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates; however, due to the short-term maturities and low risk profiles of our investments, we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk. A 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Report of Independent 
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Nuvalent, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nuvalent, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are

105

Table of Contents

material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of related party revenue share liability

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s related party revenue share liability balance as of December 31, 2024 was $17.9 million. As discussed in Note 2, the revenue share liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the estimated payments that could become due upon commercialization. Assumptions in the model include but are not limited to probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues and discount rate.

We identified the assessment of the valuation of related party revenue share liability as a critical audit matter. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of the liability. These assumptions included probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues, and discount rate. The assessment of these assumptions was challenging because they were derived from unobservable inputs. Additionally, changes to probability and timing of product approval or future product revenues could have had a significant impact on the determination of the fair value.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s valuation process for the related party revenue share liability, including certain controls related to management’s determination of the probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues and discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s probability and timing of product approval and future product revenues by comparing these assumptions to externally available publications and scientific studies for comparable products. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate used by the Company by comparing the Company’s inputs to the discount rate to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate.

NUVALENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FIN
ANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Nature of Business
Nuvalent, Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely targeted therapies for patients with cancer. The Company was founded in January 2017 as a Delaware corporation. The Company is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All of the Company’s operations are in the United States.
The Company is subject to risks similar to those of other pre-commercial stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including dependence on key individuals, the need to develop commercially viable products, competition from other companies, many of which are larger and better capitalized, the need for adequate financing to fund the development of its product candidates, the need to obtain and maintain adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property, and the impact of public health emergencies, natural disasters and geopolitical events on the Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successful, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained and maintained, that any product candidates will receive required regulatory approval or that approved products, if any, will be commercially viable. Even if the Company’s development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from the sale of its products.
The Company has incurred recurring losses since inception, including net losses of $
260.8
 million, $
126.2
 million and $
81.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
547.1
 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation and consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and under the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nuvalent Securities Corporation. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the fair value of the related party revenue share liability, the accounting for research and development contracts, including clinical trial accruals, and valuation of equity instruments. The Company bases its estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates as there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.
Concentrations of credit risk and of significant suppliers

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may be held in accounts at financial institutions that may exceed federally insured limits. However, the Company mitigates credit risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio, placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and limiting the amount of investment exposure as to maturity and investment type according to its investment policy. The Company has not experienced any credit losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to significant credit risk beyond the standard credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
The Company is dependent on third-party vendors for the manufacturing of its product candidates. In particular, the Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on a small number of vendors to manufacture materials and components required for the production of its product candidates. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the manufacturing process.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments that have maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may include money market funds and marketable securities. The Company records interest income received on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations

and comprehensive loss. The Company 
invests its excess cash in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government and agency securities and U.S. treasury bills.
Fair value measurements
The Company follows the provision of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements 
(“ASC 820”), which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable.
Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions).
The Company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities, and related party revenue share liability are carried at fair value, determined according to the fair value hierarchy described above (see Note 4
).
Marketable securities
The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, 
Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
. The Company’s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for identical securities in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or inputs that are observable (Level 2). At the time of purchase, the Company classifies marketable securities with maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.

Unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary are based on the specific identification method and are recorded to other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
When the fair value is below the amortized cost of a marketable security, an estimate of expected credit losses is made. The credit-related impairment amount is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Credit losses are recognized through the use of an allowance for credit losses account in the consolidated balance sheet and subsequent improvements in expected credit losses are recognized as a reversal of an amount in the allowance account. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the allowance for the credit loss is written-off and the excess of the amortized cost basis of the asset over its fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Fair value option for related party revenue share liability
The Company has a revenue sharing agreement with Deerfield Healthcare Innovations Fund, L.P. and Deerfield Private Design Fund, IV, L.P. (collectively, “Deerfield”), each an investor in the Company, to pay a fixed low single-digit percentage rate of net sales of certain commercial products, which represents a freestanding financial instrument. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825, 
Financial Instruments
, the Company elected the fair value option. Accordingly, the related party revenue share liability was measured at fair value upon issuance and is remeasured at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the related party revenue share liability is estimated using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the estimated payments that could become due upon commercialization. Assumptions in the model include but are not limited to the following: probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues and discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement.
Research and development and clinical trial accruals
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, consulting costs, and external costs of vendors engaged to conduct research, preclinical and clinical development activities.

Costs for research and development activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Payments for such activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued expenses. Determining the prepaid and accrued balances at the end of any reporting period incorporates certain judgments and estimates by management that are based on information available to the Company including information provided by employees and vendors regarding the progress to completion of specific tasks or costs incurred.

112

Table of Contents

Patent costs
All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses.
Stock-based compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation 
(“ASC 718”). The Company has issued stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). In accordance with ASC 718, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on a stock-based award’s grant date fair value.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. For RSUs, the fair value of an RSU is equal to the market price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense for stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. 
Stock-based awards generally vest over 
three
- or
 four-year
 service periods and stock options expire after 
ten years
.
The Company records stock-based compensation expense to research and development expense or general and administrative expense based on the underlying function of the individual that was granted the stock-based compensation award. Shares issued upon stock option exercise and RSU vesting are newly-issued shares.
The assumptions used in the Company’s Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options are as follows:
Expected Term
 — As the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term, the Company utilizes the “simplified” method, as prescribed in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetical average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the stock option.
Expected Volatility
 — The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company and that of similar entities within the Company’s industry for periods corresponding with the expected term of the grant.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 — The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period that corresponds with the expected term of the grant.
Expected Dividends
 — The expected dividend yield is 
0
% as the Company has not historically paid, and does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend on its common stock.
The assumptions used in the Company’s Black-Scholes option-pricing model are inherently subjective and represent management’s best estimates. These assumptions involve a number of variables, uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If any assumptions change, the Company’s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
Net income (loss) per share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, including potentially dilutive common shares. For periods in which the Company reported a net loss, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to the provision for income taxes.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any resulting unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within the provision for income taxes.

Cash equivalents were valued by the Company based on quoted market prices for identical securities, which represent a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Commercial paper, corporate bonds, government and agency securities, and U.S. treasury bills were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, which represent a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. During the periods presented, there were 
no
 transfers in or out of Level 3. The carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these liabilities.
The following table sets forth the changes in estimated fair value of the Company’s related party revenue share liability for the year ended 
December 31, 2024, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

The fair value of the related party revenue share liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the estimated payments that could become due upon commercialization. Assumptions in the model include but are not limited to the following: probability and timing of product approval, future product revenues and discount rate. Changes in fair value each reporting period are recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Due to changes in certain assumptions related to the probability of product approval and the timing thereof, as well as the probability and timing of sales forecasts, the Company estimated the fair value of the related party revenue share liability to be $
17.9
 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company estimated the fair value of the related party revenue share liability to be de minimis as of December 31, 2023. See Note 10 for additional information regarding the revenue sharing agreement with Deerfield

2.5
 years.
2021 equity incentive plan
In July 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSUs, unrestricted stock awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights. The number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan is subject to increase on each January 1 thereafter by 
5.0
% of the number of shares of the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors. 
The shares of Class A common stock underlying any awards that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon exercise or settlement of an award to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of stock, expired or are otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2021 Plan will be added back to the shares of Class A common stock available under the 2021 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
6,714,865
 shares of Class A common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2021 Plan.
2021 employee stock purchase plan
In July 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended and restated the “ESPP”). The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a discount in accordance with the terms of the offering and consists of consecutive, overlapping 12-month offering periods, each consisting of two six-month purchase periods beginning in December and June of each year. On the first day of each offering period, the Company will grant to each employee who is enrolled in the ESPP an option to purchase up to a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. The purchase price of each of the shares purchased in a given purchase period will be

8. Net Loss Per Share
The Company has two classes of common stock outstanding: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. 
Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote.
 Class B common stock is nonvoting
, and 
each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder at any time, subject to the ownership limitations provided for in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
 The Company allocates undistributed earnings attributable to common stock between the common stock classes on a one-to-one basis when computing net loss per share. As a result, basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock and share of Class B common stock are equivalent.

The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in each year, due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. All of the Company’s operating losses since inception have been generated in the United States.
The Company did 
no
t have any deferred tax liabilities as of

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
198.7
 million and $
238.1
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. The federal net operating losses include $
1.2
 million which expire in 
2037
 and $
197.5
 million which carryforward indefinitely, but may only be used to offset 
80
% of annual taxable income. The state net operating losses expire at various dates beginning in 
2037
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
15.7
 million and $
8.9
 million, respectively, and federal orphan drug credits of $
29.4
 million, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities. The federal and state tax credit carryforwards and the federal orphan drug credits expire at various dates beginning in 
2033
.
Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“IRC”), and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since

118

Table of Contents

inception. If the Company has experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, or the federal orphan drug credits would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, or the federal orphan drug credits before utilization. Further, until a study is completed by the Company and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products that would generate revenue from product sales and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.
The valuation allowance increased by $
119.1
 million, $
48.8
 million and $
28.7
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily as a result of increases in research and development costs capitalized under Section 174 of the IRC, research and development tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
t recorded any amounts for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company files income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. 
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. The Company is open to future tax examination under statute from 
2021
 to the present.

10. Commitments and Contingencies
Revenue share
The Company has revenue sharing agreements with Deerfield and the Company’s scientific founder to pay each of Deerfield and the scientific founder a fixed low single-digit percentage rate of net sales of certain commercial products. The payment obligation expires on the later of 12 years from the first commercial sale in a country or the expiration of the last-to-expire patent in that country for both Deerfield and the Company’s scientific founder. The Company accounts for the liability with Deerfield at fair value with changes recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (see Note 4
). The Company accounts for the obligation to the scientific founder as a contingent liability and has 
no
t accrued any liability as of 
December 31, 2024 or 2023 under this agreement. The Company has not recorded any net sales and, as a result, has not paid any amounts under these agreements.
Indemnification agreements
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, contract research organizations, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. The Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and is not currently aware of any indemnification claims.

11. Segment Information
The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and has not generated any revenue since commencing significant operations in 2018. The Company’s operations are organized and reported as a 
single
 reportable segment, which includes all activities related to the discovery, development, and commercialization of precisely targeted therapies for patients with cancer. 
This presentation is consistent with how the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), its 
Chief Executive Officer
, assesses the performance of the Company and makes operating decisions on a consolidated basis. The accounting policies of the consolidated segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see 
Note 2
). The CODM assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net loss as reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The CODM uses consolidated net loss to monitor budget versus actual results, assess cash runway, and benchmark against the Company’s competitors.
 The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets. The Company’s assets are held in the United States.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
