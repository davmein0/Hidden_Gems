Item 1. Business.
Overview
The Vita Coco Company pioneered packaged coconut water in 2004 and we have extended our business into other categories. Our mission is to deliver great tasting, natural and nutritious products that we believe are better for consumers and better for the world. We are one of the largest brands globally in the coconut and other plant waters category, and a large supplier of private label coconut water. 
Our branded portfolio is led by our 
Vita Coco
 brand, which is the leader in the coconut water category in the U.S., and also includes coconut oil, juice, and milk offerings. Our other brands include 
Ever & Ever
, a sustainably packaged water, and 
PWR LIFT
, a protein-infused fitness drink. We previously offered 
Runa
, a plant-based energy drink inspired by the guayusa plant native to Ecuador, which we ceased selling in December 2023. We supply private label products to key retailers in both the coconut water and coconut oil categories. Additionally, we generate revenue from bulk product sales to beverage and food companies.  
We source our coconut water from a diversified global network of 17 factories across seven countries supported by thousands of coconut farmers. As we do not own any of these factories, our supply chain is a fixed asset-light model designed to better react to changes in the market or consumer preferences. We also work with co-packers across four countries to support local packaging and repacking of our products and to better service our customers’ needs.
Vita Coco
 is available in over 35 countries, with our primary markets in North America, the United Kingdom (the "U.K."), and Germany. Our primary markets for private label are North America and Europe. Our products are distributed primarily through club, food, drug, mass, convenience, e-commerce and foodservice channels. Our products are also available in a variety of on-premise locations such as corporate offices, fitness clubs, airports and educational institutions.
History
The Vita Coco Company, Inc., formerly known as All Market Inc., was first incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2007 and re-incorporated in Delaware as a public benefit corporation in April 2021. We completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of our common stock in October 2021.
Industry
We operate in the functional beverages industry. Our primary brand, 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water, competes in the  global coconut and plant waters category
.
 Our 
Vita Coco 
coconut milk product, which includes our recently launched 
Vita Coco
 Treats, is a plant-based dairy alternative and our 
PWR LIFT
 brand competes in the enhanced isotonic category. We also develop and sell other brands in the beverage category, and occasionally in other categories, as we test our ideas for expanding our product portfolio. The beverage industry, and specifically the functional beverage categories, are significantly larger than the coconut and plant waters category and provide opportunities for potential growth.  
We believe per capita consumption of natural beverages is growing as a result of increasing consumer interest in plant-based alternatives and preferences for health-conscious products that have fewer added sugars and artificial ingredients, while providing more nutritional benefits. In addition, we believe that consumer awareness of the negative environmental and social impact of packaged goods has resulted in increased consumer demand for brands that are purpose-driven, take responsibility for their impact on the planet and are focused on sustainable packaging and transparent ethical values. We believe our mission is aligned with the growing demands generated by this consumer behavior. 
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive and is constantly evolving in response to ever-changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience, as well as factors related to corporate responsibility and sustainability.
Additionally, we compete within the broad non-alcoholic beverage category, and our flagship brand, 
Vita Coco
, is the market leader in the coconut water category in the U.S. Our competitors in the beverage market include large beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. and Nestlé S.A. that may have substantially greater financial resources and stronger brand recognition than we have. We also compete with other leading functional beverages including Goya, Harmless Harvest, Foco, BodyArmor, Monster Energy, Red Bull, Bang, Ocean Spray and Bai, as well as a range of

emerging brands and retailers’ own private label beverage brands. Our competition and competitors vary by market due to regional brands and taste preferences.
We are also a leading supplier of private label coconut water, and we compete with other private label suppliers for that business.
Business Operations
As of December 31, 2024, we operated in two business segments: (i) the Americas segment, comprised of our operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada; and (ii) the International segment, comprised of operations primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. 
While
 96% of our business is based on sales of coconut water, we have used our access to market to add other beverage brands, and production innovations such as 
Vita Coco
 Treats, with 
a long-term view to building a diversified beverage platform of compatible brands. 
Vita Coco
With the launch of the 
Vita Coco
 brand in New York City in 2004, we established coconut water as a premium lifestyle drink in America. 
Vita Coco 
is the coconut water category leader with greater than 40% market share in the U.S. according to Circana US for the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2024, which over indexes to younger households and to more multicultural shoppers. 
We offer 
Vita Coco
 coconut water as an alternative to sugar-packed sports drinks and other less healthy alternatives. 
Vita Coco
 has evolved from a primarily pure coconut water brand to a full portfolio of coconut-based products. The portfolio now includes multiple offerings in the coconut water category with 
Vita Coco
 Pressed, 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Juice, and Farmers Organic, with offerings in adjacent plant-based categories such as 
Vita Coco
 Coconut MLK, and 
Vita Coco
 Treats. 
Our key strategies for growth for 
Vita Coco
 coconut water include: 1) expanding the coconut water category through consumer education of the numerous usage occasions for coconut water, 2) increasing distribution of other product offerings such as Farmers Organic, 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Juice, and launching new product innovations, such as 
Vita Coco
 Treats, 3) expanding the number of households that purchase our products, 4) growing opportunities for new usage generally, and 5) developing and expanding our markets globally. 
Internationally, our business is anchored by 
Vita Coco
’s presence in the U.K., where it is the coconut water category leader with 82% market share, according to Circana UK, for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2024. Our U.K. commercial team and our supply chain based in Asia have allowed us to sell into other European and Asian countries. 
Vita Coco
 coconut water has a presence in key markets such as China, France, Germany, the Middle East, the Benelux region, Spain, the Nordic Region and Africa.
Private Label
We expanded into private label coconut water in 2016 as a way to develop stronger ties with select, strategic retail partners and improve our operating scale. Our coconut water private label offering increases the scale and efficiency of our coconut water supply chain, and also provides us with a share of the value segment, without diluting our own brand. We also supply retailers with private label coconut oil.
PWR LIFT
In 2021, we launched
 PWR LIFT,
 a beverage targeted at post-workout and recovery occasions with added nutritional benefits. 
PWR LIFT
 is a protein-infused sports drink with electrolytes, BCAAs, and zero sugar, designed to provide fitness-minded consumers with protein in a hydrating beverage.

In 2022 and 2023, we tested 
PWR LIFT 
in Arizona and Texas, while also establishing the brand within fast-growing fitness spaces like HYROX and Spartan. In early 2024, 
PWR LIFT
 expanded testing to the New York City metro area. While 
PWR LIFT
 has proved to be attractive in online sales channels, we are still forming a successful long-term approach to retail channels. As the protein drink category continues to grow, 
PWR LIFT
 will focus growing the consumer base and appeal of the brand through communicating lifestyle occasions and by messaging the broad variety of benefits that protein and hydration have to offer health-seeking consumers. In 2025, we will continue online sales as we redesign 
PWR LIFT
's approach to succeeding in the protein drink category.
Ever & Ever
Launched in 2019, 
Ever & Ever
 is a purified water brand packaged solely in aluminum bottles. Given consumer concerns with the disposal or recyclability of plastic water bottles, we created 
Ever & Ever 
to respond to the consumer

need for a sustainably packaged water product in aluminum bottles with potential infinite recyclability. 
Ever & Ever
 was launched with a focus on the food service and office channels. We paused production of 
Ever & Ever
 in 2024 and are evaluating whether to discontinue the product, as it does not meaningfully contribute to our business.
Runa
Runa
 was a guayusa plant-based, natural offering for consumers in the energy drink market. As of December 2023, we ceased offering this brand. 
Supply Chain
We engage contract manufacturers, co-packers and third-party logistics providers to manufacture and distribute our products. Our fixed asset-light model enhances production flexibility and capacity, and enables us to focus on our core in-house capabilities which include supplier management, logistics, sales and marketing, brand management and customer service. Our well-diversified global manufacturing network spans across 17 coconut water factories in seven countries that are operated by our manufacturing partners and six co-packing facilities in four countries for products not packaged near source. Our network provides us with significant production capacity and capabilities, and an ability to re-allocate coconut water sourcing in the event of supply chain issues, weather, logistics or other macroeconomic impacts. 
Coconut water needs to be transferred from the coconut into an aseptic package or converted to concentrate within hours of cutting a coconut from the tree. Our supply chain partners are positioned as close to the coconut growing regions as possible to keep quality at the highest level. Through our access and relationships with coconut processors and manufacturers in many countries, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Vietnam, we have built a unique body of knowledge and relationships that promote coconut water processing at scale, as well as gained access to farms across diversified geographies. Our co-packing facilities, which primarily use concentrate, are located in Canada, Mexico, the U.S., and the U.K. We also attempt to foster a thriving loyal farming community around our manufacturing partners through our work with charitable organizations to support agricultural education programs and investments in schooling. This community outreach has strengthened our long-term manufacturing relationships and we believe will support our capacity needs for future growth. 
Raw materials used in our business and by our co-packers consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. The principal ingredients and packaging include coconut water, Tetra Paks and caps, cardboard cartons, PET bottles, and aluminum bottles and cans. We work with our contract manufacturing partners to purchase our raw ingredients from local suppliers in accordance with rigorous standards to assure responsible sourcing, quality and safety. The majority of our products are produced and packaged with materials sourced from a single supplier, Tetra Pak, whether purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf, which provides us efficiency in the packaging and exporting of our products, and furthers our commitment to responsible sourcing, packaging near source and sustainability. Our production contracts are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars, with some limited contracts in local currencies such as the Brazilian real.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing 
Our beverages and other products are sold in club stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, and e-commerce websites, as well as other outlets.

Our products are typically shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third-party warehouses located in our selling markets. We go to market in North America through various distribution channels, including a Direct Store Delivery distribution network ("DSD"), Direct-to-Warehouse network ("DTW"), broadline distributors, and our own Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") channel. We match the customers' needs with the right route to market providing us flexibility for our established brands and for our innovations. Outside of North America, we use a combination of DTW, importers and distributors depending on the needs of the market.
Our European market is primarily retail and e-commerce operator direct sales, with some countries supported by distributor or importer type relationships. In China, we sell through a joint venture with the Jebsen Group, Coco Ventures Limited, which provides for the development, marketing, distribution and branding of coconut water-based products under the 
Vita Coco
 brand in China. Other countries are serviced through importers with limited retail direct relationships or in partnership with one of our manufacturing partners through licensing or other agreements.
We employ a dedicated global sales and commercial team. In the Americas, the sales team focuses on three main areas: (i) DSD management, (ii) national account management (including club, mass food and convenience), and (iii) retail execution. Our International sales teams are aligned geographically and by major account or by import partner, and is further supported by small field execution and marketing teams. Private label accounts are handled by each geographic division in close cooperation with supply chain leadership. Our Coco Ventures joint venture supports sales and marketing of our distributor in China.

We also employ a brand, marketing, e-commerce and insights team with strong creative, social and digital capabilities with a primary focus on the North American and European markets. Our marketing efforts are centered around educating consumers on the functional benefits of our products while fostering a deep emotional connection with our brands. From the beginning, we have been supported by a diverse group of celebrity and athlete enthusiasts. Today, we continue to collaborate with talent and influencers who we believe share our values and are authentic fans of our brands. We execute across a broad marketing mix to bring our brand to life in creative and engaging ways, ensuring we connect with our audience in genuine and meaningful ways.  
Seasonality
As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters during the warmer months of the year in our major markets.
Product Innovation
We engage in research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of creating products using natural, functional ingredients. We have years of expertise working with plant-based ingredients to deliver products to meet the needs of our customers. We balance our innovation priorities between adding functionality and taste to existing brands and researching and developing new products and brands for new occasions, need states or specific retailer opportunities.
Our global innovation function sits in the marketing team to ensure alignment with current brand initiatives and sharing of consumer insights across teams and markets. The innovation team works closely with our internal global research and development and technical teams that include employees in the U.S., Europe and Singapore focused on supplier capability, quality improvements and new processes. We also have strong supplier relationships that give us access to a broad scope of ingredients, packaging offerings and technologies. 
Intellectual Property
We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. We view our primary trademark to be VITA COCO. We have a global approach to protecting our trademarks, designs, patents and other intellectual property rights. We believe the protection of our trademarks, designs, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had over 20 registered trademarks and over five pending trademark applications in the U.S., as well as over 230 registered trademarks and over 10 pending trademark applications in other countries. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
We consider information related to formulas, processes, know-how and methods used in our production and manufacturing as proprietary and endeavor to maintain them as trade secrets. We have reasonable measures in place to keep the above-mentioned items, as well as our business and marketing plans, customer lists and contracts reasonably protected.
Government Regulation
Our products are regulated in the U.S. as conventional foods. We, along with our distributors and manufacturing and co-packing partners, are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. by federal, state and local government authorities including, among others, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state and local agencies. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA, comply with current good manufacturing practices and other standard requirements applicable to the production and distribution of conventional food products. We and our manufacturing and co-packing partners are also subject to similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These types of requirements include: product standards; product safety and reporting; marketing, sales, and distribution; packaging and labeling requirements; nutritional and health claims; advertising and promotion; import and export restrictions; and tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements.
Products that do not comply with applicable governmental or third-party regulations and standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject, but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or

recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, import holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.  In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state and third-party certifying organizations. 
Public Benefit Corporation Status and Corporate Social Responsibility
We operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation, and, therefore, our operational decision-making goes beyond solely maximizing shareholder value.

Our public benefit purpose, as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is harnessing, while protecting, nature’s resources for the betterment of the world and its habitants by creating ethical, sustainable, better-for-you beverages and consumer products that not only uplift our communities, but that do right by our planet. Furthermore, in order to advance the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, it is intended that our business and operations create a material positive impact on society, taken as a whole.
In 2022, The Vita Coco Company, Inc. was designated as a Certified B Corporation, a certification reserved for businesses that balance profit and purpose to meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability. Through achieving Certified B Corporation status, The Vita Coco Company, Inc. joined its subsidiary, All Market Europe Ltd., a U.K. company, which had previously achieved Certified B Corporation status. 
We believe that we bring our products to market through a responsibly designed supply chain, and provide farmers and manufacturers the partnership, investment and training they need to not only reduce waste and environmental impact, but also bring income and opportunity to their local communities. In 2014, we created the Vita Coco Project to support and empower our coconut farming communities by encouraging innovative farming practices, improving educational resources, and scaling our business to promote economic prosperity. With our impact driven philosophy, we seek to contribute to educational programs and facilities by supporting initiatives to build new classrooms and fund scholarships, with a goal to impact the lives of people in these communities. Additionally, we attempt to partner with other third-party organizations that share and advance our ideals, including fair trade, accessible nutrition and wellness, and environmental responsibility.
We believe this purpose-driven approach has aided our growth as we believe it is strategically aligned with the beliefs of our global consumer base and has improved our supplier relationships. To further support our public benefit purpose and impact driven philosophy, we formed the Vita Coco Community Foundation, a standalone, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, in December 2023.
Annually, we publish an Impact Report describing the environmental and social impacts of our business. As a public benefit corporation, we are required by Delaware law to provide a biennial statement on our promotion of the public benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation and of the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct. We intend to use the Impact Report to be issued later this year as such biennial statement. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2024, we had
 319
 full-time employees. Of these employees, 234 were employed in the U.S. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
Our people are at the heart of our business. Our Board of Directors (the "Board") provides oversight of the policies and procedures relating to talent, leadership, culture and compensation plans for our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee evaluates and approves the compensation plans for our executive officers. We believe that we have been able to attract diverse and highly engaged employees who share our belief in our mission and further promote our inclusive company culture. To monitor the health of our human capital resources, we track turnover, perform exit interviews, conduct periodic employee surveys, hold quarterly town halls with open question and answer sessions, and conduct performance reviews and build development plans to assist each employee achieve their potential. Based on exit interviews and employee surveys, we identify opportunities for improvement in our processes and track our employee engagement levels. We award equity grants with vesting based on continued employment to eligible employees in order to motivate retention and align our employees with our other shareholders. 
We promote and value a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees. Our Diversity and Inclusivity Committee works to celebrate all our employees, educate and recommend improvements to our processes to enhance our organization and our culture. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 50% of our employees in our global workforce identified as female, 50% identified as male, and 0% did not disclose their gender identity. In addition, at the end of 2024, approximately 30% of our employees identified as Black, Indigenous and/or People of Color or two or more races, 40%
