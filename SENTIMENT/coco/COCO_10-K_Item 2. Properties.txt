Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate headquarters is currently located in Manhattan, New York, at 250 Park Avenue South, where we lease office space that provides support to both our Americas and International segments. As of December 31, 
2024
, we occupied office facilities totaling approximately 
29,400
 square feet in the U.S., Singapore, and London, with the Singapore and London facilities primarily supporting our International segment and global supply chain. 
In August 2024, we entered into a lease agreement, effective January 1, 2025, to relocate our New York corporate headquarters within Manhattan, and will enter the new premises later in 2025. We have also leased a new space in London and will relocate this office later in 2025. W
e believe that these new office spaces will be adequate to support our requirements in New York and London..
