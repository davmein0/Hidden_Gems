Overview
The Vita Coco Company pioneered packaged coconut water in 2004 and we have extended our business into other categories. Our mission is to deliver great tasting, natural and nutritious products that we believe are better for consumers and better for the world. We are one of the largest brands globally in the coconut and other plant waters category, and a large supplier of private label coconut water. 
Our branded portfolio is led by our 
Vita Coco
 brand, which is the leader in the coconut water category in the U.S., and also includes coconut oil, juice, and milk offerings. Our other brands include 
Ever & Ever
, a sustainably packaged water, and 
PWR LIFT
, a protein-infused fitness drink. We also previously offered 
Runa
, a plant-based energy drink inspired by the guayusa plant native to Ecuador, which we ceased selling in December 2023. We supply private label products to key retailers in both the coconut water and coconut oil categories. Additionally, we generate revenue from bulk product sales to beverage and food companies.  
We source our coconut water from a diversified global network of 17 factories across seven countries supported by thousands of coconut farmers. As we do not own any of these factories, our supply chain is a fixed asset-lite model designed to better react to changes in the market or consumer preferences. We also work with co-packers across four countries to support local packaging and repacking of our products and to better service our customers’ needs.

Table of Contents
Vita Coco
 is available in over 35 countries, with our primary markets in North America, the U.K., and Germany. Our primary markets for private label are North America and Europe. Our products are distributed primarily through club, food, drug, mass, convenience, e-commerce, and foodservice channels. Our products are also available in a variety of on-premise locations such as corporate offices, fitness clubs, airports, and educational institutions.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including the key trends and uncertainties highlighted below:
Risks Associated with our Supply Chain and Shipping

Our global asset-light supply chain model has been an integral part of our ability to efficiently scale our business and compete in the marketplace, and to support our private label business. This asset-light model allows us to effectively manage total delivery costs and afford greater ability to shift volume between our suppliers to optimize our supply chain, and better manage our supply levels. In addition, our scale of sourcing has allowed us to add capacity as needed and service retailers more reliably, and we believe that our global position as one of the largest and highest quality coconut water procurers in the world protects our customer and supplier relationships.  
However, in order to make our supply chain model successful and efficient, we source a large amount of our finished goods from international countries, which exposes us to international supply chain inflation, particularly ocean freight. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment resulting from geopolitical and economic instability (including the effects of current wars and other international conflicts) and variability in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflationary cost environments may affect our global supply chain. Inflation rates and foreign exchange rate movements varies by country and relevant period, and can impact our expenses significantly. 
We experienced significant inflation and instability on transportation costs over the past three years, which affected our costs and margins significantly. Although we saw these transportation costs return to near pre-pandemic levels in the middle of 2023, in 2024, we saw significant cost increases and supply constraints caused by recent geopolitical disruption. We expect instability in pricing to continue caused by recent geopolitical disruption of shipping lanes due to ocean carriers avoiding the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea regions due primarily to concerns that Houthi forces, based in Yemen, may attack freighters. We experienced spot cost increases for ocean freight routes from Asia, and then more significant cost increases when carriers began to route away from the Suez Canal. As a result, beginning in the late spring of 2024 and for most of the summer, we were challenged to secure the ocean container capacity that we needed. In early October 2024, the east coast ports of the U.S. experienced a labor strike that temporarily shut those ports, resulting in some delays even after the ports reopened. While a deal has been announced to enter into a new labor agreement, and no port disruption is expected, it is unclear if a final agreement has been ratified, so some disruption risk remains. When disruptions like port strikes are anticipated, the ocean freight carriers may issue notices of impending surcharges to be applied if the disruption occurs, which creates uncertainty as to our actual expected costs. The changes in shipping container prices and service levels and cost increases in shipping and port congestion related costs have materially impacted our financial results in recent years. Due to the price sensitivity of our products, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers without impacting our volume, revenue, margins, and operating results and we have no certainty when these pressures may lessen. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation carefully to understand any future potential impact on its people and business. 
Consumer Demand and Relationships with Key Customers
Coconut water accounted for 96% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and we believe that sales of coconut water will continue to be a significant portion of our business in the foreseeable future. The coconut water category has been growing steadily in recent years and our Vita Coco brand has successfully retained over 40% market share in the U.S. and over 82%  market share in the U.K. in this category. We are also a significant supplier of private label coconut water and coconut oil products in the U.S. and Europe. Any material negative change to consumer demand for our products or coconut water generally, failure to grow the coconut water category, or loss of significant private label demand, could adversely affect our business. Consumer demand between branded products and private label may vary over time. In order to meet this consumer demand for our products, we also are subject to the risk of overly relying upon our largest customers for both our branded and private label business. For example, in 2023, we started the discontinuation of the private label coconut water and coconut oil supply relationship with one of our significant customers as the terms required to retain the business were contrary to our long term margin targets. While we continued the supply relationship for a significant portion of their private label coconut water needs in 2024 at the customer's request, we are expecting the loss of 
42
Table of Contents
further regions that we serviced for this customer during 2024. We will continue to service their needs if we are asked and it aligns with our long-term margin targets. Any loss of business or changes in our relationships with our key customers can impact our operating results in future periods, as may changes in consumer demand for private label versus branded products.  
Ability to Generate Growth Through Product Innovation
The beverage industry is subject to shifting consumer preferences which present opportunities for new beverage occasions, tastes and functional benefits. Our future success is therefore partially dependent on our ability to identify these trends and develop products and brands that effectively meet those needs. We also invest in sales and marketing and execute our sales strategy to develop and deepen consumers’ connection to our brand and new products and to create category growth and increase our branded share. Our innovation efforts focus on developing and marketing product extensions, improving upon the quality and taste profiles of existing products, and introducing new products or brands to meet evolving consumer needs. For example, in 2024 we introduced 
Vita Coco
 Treats, a refreshingly sweet, flavorful coconutmilk-based drink for consumers looking for an indulgent treat. In 2025, we intend to expand distribution of 
Vita Coco
 Treats to select retailers nationwide.  
We maintain in-house research and development capabilities as well as strong third-party relationships with flavor development houses, and we monitor the latest advancements to support continued innovation and learning. Our ability to successfully improve existing products, or develop, market and sell new products or brands, or our ability to grow the category or gain branded share, depends on our commitment and continued investment in sales execution, marketing, innovation, and our willingness to try and fail and learn from our experiences.  
Ability to Successfully Execute Both In-Store and Online
To aid the growth of our business, we intend to continue improving our operational efficiency and leverage our brand position across channels, and therefore have a balanced approach to investment and development of capabilities in retail and e-commerce execution. Our
 DSD
 network is an important asset in executing physical retail programs and ensuring product availability and visibility in the U.S. In 2024, we offered more multi-packs in coconut water in 
U.S.
 retail to increase consumption with core consumers, and increased distribution of our other product offerings. Managing our DSD network requires relationship building and communication as to plans, and alignment of goals and interests, and we are not always a top priority for our DSD network. We also continue to expand our business in e-commerce, including our DTC business, and look to adapt our approaches as consumer and retail behavior changes to ensure we remain competitive and visible regardless of channel.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Net Sales
We generate revenue through the sale of our 
Vita Coco
 branded coconut water, Private Label and Other products in the Americas and International segments. Our sales are predominantly made to distributors or to retailers for final sale to consumers through retail channels, which includes sales to traditional brick and mortar retailers, who may also resell our products through their own online platforms. Our revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, discounts, credits and any taxes collected from consumers.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold includes the costs of the products sold to customers, inbound and outbound shipping and handling costs, freight and duties, shipping and packaging supplies, and warehouse fulfillment costs.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of products we sell, the channel through which we sell our products, the promotional environment in the marketplace, manufacturing costs, exchange rates, commodity prices and transportation rates. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these variables.
43
Table of Contents
Management believes gross margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses gross profit and gross margin as key measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance.
Operating Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") include marketing expenses, promotional expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Marketing and promotional expenses consist primarily of costs incurred promoting and marketing our products and are primarily driven by investments to grow our business and retain customers. General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, broker commissions and other headcount-related expenses associated with supply chain & operations, finance, information technology, human resources and other administrative-related personnel, as well as general overhead costs of the business, including research and development for new innovations, rent and related facilities and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization, and legal, accounting, and professional fees. We expense all SG&A as incurred. 
Other Income (Expense), Net
Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivative Instruments
We are subject to foreign currency risks as a result of our inventory purchases and intercompany transactions. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risks, we and our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative instruments consists of gains or losses on such foreign currency exchange contracts which are unsettled as of period end. See “—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
”
 for further information.
Foreign Currency Gain/(Loss)
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We maintain the financial statements of each entity within the group in its local currency, which is also the entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency gain/(loss) represents the transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. See “—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
”
 for further information.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and money market funds.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest payable on our credit facilities and vehicle loans.
Income Tax Expense
We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Operating Segments
We operate in two reporting segments:
•
Americas
—The Americas segment is comprised of our operations in the Americas region, primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
•
International
—The International segment is comprised of our operations primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific regions.
44
Table of Contents
Each segment derives its revenues from the following product categories:
•
Vita Coco Coconut Water
—This product category consists of all branded coconut water product offerings under the 
Vita Coco
 labels, where the majority ingredient is coconut water. For these products, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue.
•
Private Label 
—This product category consists of all private label product offerings, which includes coconut water and coconut oil. The Company determined the production and distribution of private label products represents a distinct performance obligation. Since there is no alternative use for these products and the Company has the right to payment for performance completed to date, the Company recognizes the revenue for the production of these private label products over time as the production for open purchase orders occurs, which may be prior to any shipment.
•
Other—
This product category consists of all other products, which included 
Runa 
(until we ceased selling it in December 2023)
, 
and includes
 Ever & Ever 
and
 PWR LIFT
 product offerings, 
Vita Coco
 product extensions beyond coconut water, coconut milk products, and other revenue transactions (e.g., bulk product sales). For these products, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue.

The increase in net sales was driven by higher coconut water CE volumes across both the Americas and International segments, including 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water volume growth of 5.8% and improved 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water pricing due to reduced retailer promotional activity, partially offset by the transition of private label oil business.

Americas Segment
Americas net sales increased by $12.1 million, or 2.8%, to $442.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $430.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by CE volume growth of 2.7% with additional benefit from branded pricing. These increases were partially offset by a decline in private label volume due to the transition out of private label oil at a key customer, and supply constraints impacting private label coconut water. 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water net sales increased by $26.1 million, or 8.2%, to $343.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $317.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of increased CE volume growth and benefits from pricing actions.
Private Label net sales decreased by $13.3 million, or 12.9%, to $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in sales was driven by net CE volume declines of 1.9%, as volume declines of private label coconut oil and the associated product price/mix impact more than offset growth of private label coconut water.

Table of Contents
Net Sales for Other products decreased by $0.7 million, or 7.1%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by CE volume decline of 10.4%. During 2024, the Company strategically simplified the product assortment within this category to decrease complexity and maximize profitability.
International Segment
International net sales increased by $10.3 million, or 16.3%, to $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increased sales were driven by CE volume growth of 12.8%, with notable growth in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region, in addition to benefits from net pricing actions.
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water net sales increased by $8.5 million, or 20.3%, to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increased sales was driven by higher CE volume, primarily in the European region, and benefits from net pricing actions. These increases were partially offset by volume decreases in the Asia Pacific region ("APAC").  
Private Label net sales increased by $0.6 million, or 3.3%, to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was driven by CE volume growth in EMEA, which was partially offset by CE volume decline in shipments from APAC.
Net Sales for Other products increased by $1.2 million, or 42.6%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven primarily by CE volume growth in both EMEA and APAC regions.

On a consolidated and segment basis, the increase was primarily driven by elevated transportation costs relating to ocean freight, which was partly offset by lower finished goods costs, partially driven by private label product mix, and domestic logistics. 
On a consolidated basis, gross profit increased by $18.1 million, or 10.0%, to $198.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $180.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was a result of CE volume growth, 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water net pricing improvement and lower domestic transportation costs, partially offset by elevated transportation costs relating to ocean freight. As a result, gross margin increased approximately 1.9% percentage points to 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 36.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increased SG&A expense was primarily driven by an increase of $4.5 million in personnel-related expenses and bad debt expense of $2.2 million primarily due to the uncertainty of product delivery and repayment of advances made to a supplier. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 million lower investments in marketing expenses primarily due to inventory constraints through the third quarter of 2024, as well as the absence of a Vita Coco Community Foundation donation of $1.5 million and an impairment loss of $0.4 million related to land in Ecuador recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivative Instruments
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an unrealized loss of $8.2 million for the mark-to-market changes in the fair value on the outstanding derivative instruments for forward foreign currency exchange contracts, with the largest loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the contracts hedging the Brazilian real, offset by gains in British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an unrealized loss of $0.9 million relating to outstanding derivative instruments for forward foreign currency exchange contracts. All forward foreign currency exchange contracts were entered to hedge some of our exposures to the British pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Malaysian ringgit, Euro, and Thai baht.
Foreign Currency Gain/(Loss)
Foreign currency loss was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a $0.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in both years was a result of movements in various foreign currency exchange rates related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $4.1

million, to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $2.6 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in interest income period over period was due to the cash investment program that began in April 2023, in addition to higher levels of cash invested with financial institutions compared to prior year.

Income tax expense was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 21.0% from 19.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for the current period is in line with the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, due to offsetting items having minimal net impact on the rate. Primarily, the benefit of lower statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions is offset by state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the same period in the prior year is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily driven by lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the associated credits available to offset U.S. income tax. The change in effective tax rates between the periods is primarily attributable to state income taxes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors and lenders. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
These non-GAAP measures are key metrics used by management and our Board, to assess our financial performance. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA with adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items, that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance.
A reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below:

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the amount relates to the impairment loss of assets held for sale. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our business operations and proceeds on borrowings through our credit facilities and term loans. We had $164.7 million and $132.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Considering recent market conditions and our business assumptions, we have reevaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flows from operating activities and cash available under our 2020 Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein and the foreseeable future. 
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, our working capital needs primarily for inventory build, our global footprint, the expansion of our marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products and the continued market consumption of our products, as well as any shareholder distribution either through equity buybacks or dividends. Our asset-light operating model has historically provided us with a low cost nimble, and scalable supply chain, which allows us to adapt to changes in the market or consumer preferences while also efficiently introducing new products across our platform. We may seek additional equity or debt financing in the future in order to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and/or new IT infrastructures. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.

Operating Activities
Our main source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary use of cash in operating activities are for cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities decreased $64.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was substantially driven by an increase in inventory purchases to rebuild inventory to improved levels to better support the business, and the timing of certain working capital payments, partly offset by higher cash generation from the business growth.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities increased $0.4 million due to equipment purchases and technology related capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used by financing activities increased $14.6 million, primarily driven by share repurchases that occurred in 2024 and lower proceeds from stock award exercises. See Note 14, 
Stockholders' Equity,
 for further discussion on share repurchases. 
Debt
We had an immaterial amount of outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to vehicle loans. 
Revolving Credit Facility 
In May 2020, the Company entered into the 2020 Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association consisting of a revolving line of credit, which currently provides for committed borrowings of $60 million. On February 14, 2024, the 2020 Credit Facility was amended and extended for five years, with an amended maturity date of February 13, 2030. 
Starting in December 2022, borrowings on the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at rates based on either: 1) a fluctuating rate per annum determined to be the sum of Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a spread defined in the credit agreement (the "Spread"); or 2) a fixed rate per annum determined to be the sum of the Term SOFR plus the Spread. The Spread ranges from 1.00% to 1.75%, which is based on the Company’s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as defined in the credit agreement. In addition, the Company was subject to an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.10% and 0.20% on the unused amount of the line of credit in the year ended December 31, 2024, with the rate based on the Company’s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). Beginning on February 14, 2025, the unused commitment fees will range from 0.125% to 0.225%.  
51
Table of Contents
The borrowings made prior to December 2022 bore interest at rates based on either: 1) London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"); or 2) a specified base rate (determined by reference to the greatest of the prime rate published by Wells Fargo, the federal funds effective rate plus 1.5% and one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%), as selected periodically by the Company. The LIBOR-based loans bore interest at LIBOR plus the Spread. The unused commitment fee prior to the December 2022 amendment was the same. 
There were no amounts drawn on the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we were compliant with all financial covenants. 
Vehicle Loans
We periodically enter into vehicle loans. Interest rate on these vehicle loans range from 4.56% to 5.68%. The outstanding balance on the vehicle loans as of December 31, 2024 was less than $0.1 million.
For additional information, see Note 10, 
Debt,
 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations to repay indebtedness and required interest payments and unused commitment fees under our Revolving Facility and vehicle loans. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility. Any future outstanding balances on the Revolving Facility will be required to be repaid by February 2030. 
We lease certain assets under noncancelable operating leases, which expire through 2025. The leases relate primarily to office space in addition to machinery and equipment. Future minimum commitments under these leases are $0.4 million as of December 31, 2024. 
 As of December 31, 2024, we also have inventory purchase commitments, which include any raw material or packaging commitments with our suppliers to secure our needs for future orders, which are generally due to be paid within one year. We also have production purchase commitments from our manufacturers based on our production plans, forecasts and contracts, that might result in costs if we were to reduce our purchases significantly in 2025 or for some relationships, in future years. We have other contractual payments related to information technology service agreements, sponsorship and marketing agreements, and minimum contractual third-party warehouse commitments, which are not individually material.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
52
Table of Contents
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 ("ASC 606"). ASC 606 defines a five-step model that requires entities exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which include (1) identifying the contract or agreement with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised good is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products. Each contract includes a single performance obligation to transfer control of the product to the customer. Our revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, discounts, credits and any taxes collected from consumers.
For our various products in the 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water and Other product categories, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue. The transaction price recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the sale of the product. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at that time. The Company does not have any significant contracts with customers requiring performance beyond delivery, and contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that would meet the criteria for a distinct good or service that could cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent fulfillment costs, which are included in cost of goods sold, rather than revenue.
Additionally, the Company determined the production and distribution of Private Label products represents a distinct performance obligation. Since there is no alternative use for these products and the Company has the right to payment for performance completed to date, the Company recognizes the revenue for the production of these Private Label products over time as the production for open purchase orders is completed, which may be prior to any shipment. The resulting contract assets are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.
The Company provides trade promotions and sales discounts to its customers and distributors. Since these sales promotions and sales discounts do not meet the criteria for a distinct good or service, they are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers and distributors for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. These consolidated financial statements include accruals for these promotion and discounts. The accruals are made for invoices that have not yet been received as of year-end and are recorded as a reduction of sales, and are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgement with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. 
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes 
("ASC 740"), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax assets and liabilities computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
We must make assumptions and judgments to estimate the amount of valuation allowances to be recorded against our deferred tax assets, which take into account current tax laws and estimates of the amount of future taxable income, if any. Changes to any of the assumptions or judgments could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is measured in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other 
(ASC 350"). Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis on December 31, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist.
53
Table of Contents
The Company has determined that there are three reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting units and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of the reporting units exceeds their fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.
Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead, or if the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units with their carrying amount. The fair value of each of the reporting units is estimated by blending the results from the income approach and the market multiples approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly-traded companies in our industry, and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of our business. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans, projected future revenues and cash flows, which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and the industry. The cash flows are based on five-year financial forecasts developed internally by management and are discounted to a present value using discount rates that properly account for the risk and nature of the respective reporting unit’s cash flows and the rates of return market participants would require to invest their capital in our reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no impairments recorded.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Following the IPO, as an emerging growth company, we elected to apply the extended transition period. Based on the closing share price and the market value of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2023, the Company was deemed a large accelerated public company filer as of December 31, 2023. As a result, beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company was not able to rely on the extended transition period noted above and was required to adopt all new accounting pronouncements within the same time periods as public companies.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities.
As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding amounts related to our Revolving Facility incur interest fees at variable interest rates and are affected by changes in the general level of market interest rates. However, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our net sales, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our international operations. We generally target to hedge a majority of our forecasted yearly foreign currency exchange exposure through a 24-month rolling layered approach and leave a portion of our currency forecast floating at spot rate. Our currency forecast and hedge

positions are reviewed quarterly. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with our balance sheet positions are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of operations.
The total notional values of our forward exchange contracts were $107.4 million and $121.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The derivatives on the forward exchange contracts resulted in an unrealized loss of $8.2 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an approximately $1.9 million gain or loss. 
Part of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2024, a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies would have caused our cash and cash equivalents to decrease or increase by $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies would have caused our cash and cash equivalents to decrease or increase by $0.1 million.
Inflation Risk
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of transportation, labor and manufacturing costs. In recent years, we have seen fluctuating transportation costs caused by global supply chain disruptions or geopolitical instability and general inflation effects, which may cause pressure on our costs and margins. More specifically, we source a large amount of our finished goods from international countries, which exposes us to international supply chain inflation, particularly ocean freight. During the year ended December 31, 2024, general inflationary pressures continue to increase the other elements of our cost of goods and operating expenses. Recently, there have been discussions about potential tariffs and other import related fees, on goods, including those imported from China, Mexico, and Canada, and while the specifics are unclear, if tariffs are implemented on goods from these countries, or other countries where the Company does business, they may raise the Company's cost of importation of coconut water and require the Company to adjust its pricing or strategy.
Credit Risk
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers. As of December 31, 2024, sales to two customers represented approximately 48% of our consolidated net sales. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. We maintain provisions for potential credit losses and evaluate the solvency of our customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts and customer credits need to be recorded. Significant economic disruptions or a slowdown in the economy could result in substantial additional charges.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Vita Coco Company, Inc.
New York, New York
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Vita Coco Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Vita Coco Company, Inc.: 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Vita Coco Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Trade Promotion Accrual — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statement
s
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s contracts with customers include variable consideration, including trade promotions. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction in revenue when the related revenue is recognized, and is recorded using the expected value method, with updates to estimates and related accruals of variable consideration occurring each period based on historical experience and changes in circumstances.  
We identified the estimation of trade promotion accruals by management as a critical audit matter. These accruals are based on contract terms and the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and requires management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance results. Consequently, auditing these assumptions require subjective auditor judgment

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the estimation and calculation of the trade promotion accruals, including management’s controls over the review of the period-end accrual.
•
We selected a sample of individual customers and promotional periods included in management’s detail of the recorded trade promotion accruals, and evaluated inputs relevant to recorded amounts, including contractual pricing and rebate arrangements with customers and customer claims received subsequent to the accrual period, which were compared to source documents.
•
We selected a sample of subsequent credits submitted by customers,inspected relevant source documents and compared to recorded amounts.
•
We tested the trade promotion accrual at year-end by developing an expectation of the amount by applying the ratio of gross sales and trade promotion accrual balances at interim periods to gross sales in the fourth quarter and compared it to the balance recorded by management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 
(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
1. 
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Vita Coco Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) develops, markets, and distributes various coconut water products under the brand name 
Vita Coco 
and for retailers' own brands, predominantly in the United States ("U.S."). Other products include coconut milk, coconut oil, water (under the brand name 
Ever & Ever
), protein infused fitness drinks (under the brand name 
PWR LIFT) 
and coconut as a commodity. We also offered a natural energy drink (under the brand name 
Runa
), which we ceased selling in December 2023.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware as All Market Inc. on January 17, 2007. On September 9, 2021, we changed our name to The Vita Coco Company, Inc. In 2018, the Company purchased certain assets and liabilities of 
Runa
, which was marketed and distributed primarily in the U.S. until the Company ceased selling the brand in December 2023. The Company completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of common stock in October 2021.
We are a public benefit corporation under Section 362 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As a public benefit corporation, our Board is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to manage or direct our business and affairs in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of our stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct and the specific public benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation. 
The Company has 
ten
 wholly-owned subsidiaries including 
four
 wholly-owned Asian subsidiaries established between fiscal 2012 and 2015, 
four
 North American subsidiaries established between 2012 and 2018, as well as All Market Europe, Ltd. (“AME”) in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") established during 2009, and 
one
 subsidiary in Germany established during 2023.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Impact of Global Events Causing Macroeconomic Uncertainty

Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment resulting from current geopolitical and economic instability (including the effects of current wars and other international conflicts) and the high interest rates, foreign exchange rates, potential tariffs and other import related fees, and inflationary cost environment may affect our global supply chain. It is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of these macroeconomic uncertainties on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Future events and effects related to these macroeconomic uncertainties cannot be determined with precision and actual results could significantly differ from estimates or forecasts.
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. Management must apply significant judgement in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process may yield a range of reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes, and management must select an amount that falls within 
65

THE VITA COCO COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 
(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
that range of reasonable estimates. The most significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements relate to share-based compensation, assessing long-lived assets for impairment, estimating the net realizable value of inventories, the determination of the current expected credit losses allowance, assessing goodwill for impairment, the determination of the value of trade promotions and assessing the realizability of deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606. ASC 606 defines a five-step model that requires entities exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which include (1) identifying the contract or agreement with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised good is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products. Each contract includes a single performance obligation to transfer control of the product to the customer. Our revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, discounts, credits and any taxes collected from consumers.
For the Company’s various products in the 
Vita Coco
 Coconut Water and Other product categories (refer to Note 3, 
Revenue Recognition
), control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue. The transaction price recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the sale of the product. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at that time. The Company does not have any significant contracts with customers requiring performance beyond delivery, and contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that would meet the criteria for a distinct good or service that could cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent fulfillment costs, which are included in cost of goods sold, rather than revenue.
Additionally, the Company determined the production and distribution of Private Label products represents a distinct performance obligation. Since there is no alternative use for these products and the Company has the right to payment for performance completed to date, the Company recognizes the revenue for the production of these Private Label products over time as the production for open purchase orders is completed, which may be prior to any shipment. The resulting contract assets are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
The Company provides trade promotions and sales discounts to its customers and distributors. Since these sales promotions and sales discounts do not meet the criteria for a distinct good or service, they are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers and distributors for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. These consolidated financial statements include accruals for these promotion and discounts. The accruals are made for invoices that have not yet been received as of year-end and are recorded as a reduction of sales, and are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgement with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. 
Cost of Goods Sold
Costs of goods sold includes the costs of the products sold to customers, inbound and outbound shipping and handling costs, freight and duties, shipping and packaging supplies, and warehouse fulfillment costs incurred in operating and staffing warehouses.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the sale of inventory represent outbound distribution costs, and are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations.
 Shipping and handling costs were $
13,100
, $
13,261
 and $
13,387
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Marketing and Promotional Expenses
Marketing and promotional expenses, including advertising expenses, consist of investments to grow our business and retain customers, including costs related to influencers, trade shows, product samples, advertising campaigns on social media and various other digital platforms, point of sale displays, and various event sponsorships.
 Marketing and promotional expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the period they are incurred and were $

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 for awards issued under the 2014 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan and the 2021 Stock Incentive Award Plan.
The Company measures all awards based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period of each stock award grant, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award by using the accelerated attribution method. The Company applies an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management, adjustment to compensation expense may be required in future periods. The Company issues stock-based awards with service-based and performance-based and market-based vesting conditions. The Company recognizes expense for performance-based awards when it becomes probable that such awards will be earned over a requisite service period. The Company defers the recognition of compensation expense for the stock awards that vest upon qualifying liquidity events until the qualifying events are probable of occurrence. Stock awards are equity-classified, as they do not contain a cash settlement option or other features requiring them to be liability-classified.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock awards with service-based vesting conditions and performance-based vesting conditions. For stock awards with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions, the Company uses the Barrier option valuation model to determine the fair value.
The Company has classified most of its stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in selling, general, and administrative expenses, reflecting the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified. There are restricted stock units previously granted to entities affiliated with a major customer, which was recognized as a stock-based sales incentive based on guidance in ASC 606 and reflected as a reduction in the transaction price revenue.
 See Note 14, 
Stockholders' Equity
 for further information.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax assets and liabilities computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 
(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
In accordance with ASC Topic 260 
Earnings Per Share
 ("ASC 260"), net income per common share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods, calculated using the treasury stock method. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and service warrants outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive in-the-money stock options, net of assumed treasury share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and money market instruments with maturities of three months or less.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining such an allowance, the Company considers historical losses and existing economic conditions, as well as the credit quality of each customer. Accounts receivable are charged off when the Company deems amounts to be uncollectible.
Inventory
Inventory represents raw materials, finished goods, packaging, and inbound shipping and handling and is reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company reserves for finished goods that are close to the date of expiration.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term if shorter, using the straight-line method of depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:
•
Equipment and computer software and hardware – 
3
-
7
 years
•
Leasehold improvements – The lesser of the life of the asset or the term of the lease
•
Vehicles – 
5
 years
•
Furniture and fixtures – 
3
-
5
 years
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consisted primarily of acquired trade names and distributor relationships. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of the intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 
ten years
, using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, principally intangibles and property and equipment, by comparing asset group’s carrying value to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from such assets when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or a triggering event. When a triggering event is identified, a test of recoverability is performed by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 
(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
associated with such assets and comparing them to the carrying value of the asset. When the recoverability test fails, the Company measures the impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets compared to the carrying amount of the asset. The fair value of the trade names is determined through an income approach using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of the distributor relationships is determined through an income approach using the excess earnings method.
Acquisitions
The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting framework in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, 
Business Combinations 
("ASC 805"). ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill. The acquiree’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company allocated the purchase price, including the fair value of any non-cash and contingent consideration, to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the relevant acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
Contingent consideration payable in cash or a fixed dollar amount settleable in a variable number of shares is classified as a liability and recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company performs valuations of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration and allocates the purchase price to its respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration requires the use of significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, the probability of the achievement of specified milestones, and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration in a business combination.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is measured in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other 
("ASC 350"). Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis on December 31, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist.
The Company has determined that there are 
three
 reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment: (i) the Americas reporting unit, (ii) the Europe reporting unit, and (iii) the Asia reporting unit. All of the Company’s goodwill is allocated to the Americas reporting unit. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting units and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of the reporting units exceeds their fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.
Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead, or if the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units with their carrying amount. The fair value of each of the reporting units is estimated by blending the results from the income approach and the market multiples approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly-traded companies in the Company’s industry, and require to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of the Company’s business. It is the Company’s policy to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans, projected future revenues and cash flows,

which reflect changes anticipated in the economy and the industry. The cash flows are based on five-year financial forecasts developed internally by management and are discounted to a present value using discount rates that properly account for the risk and nature of the respective reporting unit’s cash flows and the rates of return market participants would require to invest their capital in the Company’s reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were 
no
 impairments recorded. 
Supplier Advances
The Company issues advances to certain manufacturers with interest at rates between 
0
% and 
4
% with terms extending to February 2028
. 
These advances are assessed for collectability and an allowance for credit losses is recognized when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms.
 The Company recorded an allowance of $
1,557
 and $
345
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Foreign Currency
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company maintains the financial statements of each entity within the group in its local currency, which is also the entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in determining net income for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate applicable during the period. Translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations when incurred.
Derivative Instruments
The Company periodically enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to the consolidated statements of operations for the change in fair value of the derivative instruments, as the contracts have not been designated as a hedge instrument.
 Refer to Note 12, Derivative Instruments, for more information.
Segment Information
The Company operates as 
two
 operating and reportable segments: (i) Americas segment, which is comprised of the Company’s operations in the Americas region, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and (ii) International segment, which is comprised of the Company’s operations primarily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s cash and accounts receivable are subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash balances are primarily on deposit with banks in the U.S. which are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250. At times, such cash may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. To minimize the risk, the Company’s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions and any excess cash above a certain minimum balance could be invested in overnight money market treasury deposits in widely diversified accounts. 
Substantially, all of the Company’s customers are either wholesalers or retailers of beverages. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchase from these or any large customers, or the loss of a large customer or customer groups could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
 The Company is exposed to concentration of credit risk from its major customers for which two customers represented 
48
%, 
53
%, and 
54
% of total net sales during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In addition, the two customers also accounted for 
30
% and 
36
% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has not experienced credit issues with these customers.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Segment Reporting 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
ASU 2023-07
, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in 
ASU 2023-07
, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in 
ASC 280
 on an interim and annual basis. 
ASU 2023-07
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and disclosures.
Leases 
The Company leases certain office space and machinery and equipment, which are primarily classified as operating leases. These leases expire at various dates through 2025. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants. Operating leases are included within right-of-use assets, net, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included within Property, plant and equipment, net, Accrued expenses, and Other long-term liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued 
ASC 842
, 
ASU 2016-02
, Leases (Topic 842), which was amended by subsequent Accounting Standard Updates ("ASUs"), to enhance the comparability and usefulness of financial reporting around leasing activity. The new standard supersedes the existing authoritative literature for lease accounting under 
ASC 840
, with a focus on applying a “right-of-use model.” The guidance for leases under 
ASC 842
 results in a right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and lease liability being reported on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term greater than twelve months. In June 2020, the FASB issued 
ASU 2020-05
, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606) and
 Leases
 (Topic 842): Effective Dates for certain entities, which deferred the effective date of 
ASU 2016-02
 for certain entities. 
ASC 842
 was effective for the Company, as an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”), for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. 
The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2022 using the alternative modified retrospective transition approach in accordance with 
ASU 2018-11
,
 Leases
 (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, where the adoption date represents the initial date of application. As part of its adoption, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients requiring no reassessment of whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, or the capitalization of initial direct costs for any existing leases. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedient that permits the exclusion of leases considered to be short-term. Under the alternative modified retrospective transition approach, the reported results for 2022 reflect the application of 
ASC 842
 guidance, whereas comparative periods and the respective disclosures prior to the adoption of 
ASC 842
 are presented using the legacy guidance of 
ASC 840
. As a result of adopting the new standard, the Company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $
1,866
 and $
2,097
, respectively, on the Company’s 
consolidated balance sheet
 as of January 1, 2022. The difference of $
231
 between the operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities represents reclassification of deferred rent liability from other liabilities to operating lease right-to-use assets at the adoption date. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Current Expected Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued 
ASU 2016-13
, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("
ASU 2016-13
"). The new accounting standard introduced the current expected credit losses methodology ("CECL") for estimating allowances for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized costs, including loans and trade receivables. 
ASU 2016-13
 was effective for the Company, as an EGC, for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method

for all financial assets in scope. The amounts for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 methodology, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable U.S. GAAP.
As a part of the adoption, the Company selected to apply roll-rate method to estimate current expected credit losses for its accounts receivable population and weighted average remaining maturity ("WARM") method for supplier advances.
The difference of $
1,070
 between the incurred credit loss estimate and current expected credit loss estimate was recorded as cumulative effect adjustment to the Company’s opening retained earnings and reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2023 as a result of the

 adoption. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows.

In November 2024, the FASB issued 
ASU 2024-03
, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires expenses in the consolidated statement of operations to be disaggregated into functional categories and separate significant individual expense items that are material to the understanding of the financial statements. 
ASU 2024-03
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting 
ASU 2024-03

ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance on a prospective basis when it becomes effective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting 
ASU 2023-09
.

3. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. The Company disaggregates revenue into the following product categories:
•
Vita Coco Coconut Water
 – This product category consists of all branded coconut water product offerings under the 
Vita Coco
 labels, where the majority ingredient is coconut water. The Company determined that the sale of the products represents a distinct performance obligation as customers can benefit from purchasing the products on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customers. For these products, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue.
•
Private Label 
– This product category consists of all private label product offerings, which includes coconut water and coconut oil. The Company determined the production and distribution of private label products represents a distinct performance obligation. Since there is no alternative use for these products and the Company has the right to payment for performance completed to date, the Company recognizes the revenue for the production of these private label products over time as the production for open purchase orders occurs, which may be prior to any shipment.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing
The Company’s goodwill is allocated to the Americas reporting unit and is tax deductible. In December 31, 2024, the Company performed the qualitative assessment only, which did not indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of the reporting units exceeds their fair value, resulting in no further quantitative testing. Based on the results of the annual impairment test, the Company concluded that no impairment to goodwill existed as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
Intangible Assets, ne
t
Long-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful life. Since the intangibles are subject to amortization, they are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Under ASC 360, long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In step 1, the entity determines recoverability of the asset group by comparing its carrying value with the sum of its undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, then step 2 must be performed, in which the entity compares the fair value of the asset group to its carrying amount. The excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value, if any, would be recognized as an impairment loss.
In 2022, the Company identified facts and circumstances indicating the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of 
Runa
, including the trade names and distributor relationships, may not be recoverable, resulting in the determination that a triggering event had occurred. The Company performed step 1 and determined that the 
Runa
 intangible assets were not recoverable based on a test of recoverability using expected undiscounted future cash flows for the 
Runa
 brand in the Americas. For both trade names and distributor relationships, the Company applied step 2, by determining the fair value of these intangible assets, which concluded that the fair value was significantly below the carrying amount. Accordingly, the total net book value of these intangible assets of $
6,714
 was impaired in the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets, net was $

 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

2020 Credit Facility
In May 2020, the Company entered into the 
five-year
 credit facility (the "2020 Credit Facility") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association consisting of a revolving line of credit, which currently provides for committed borrowings of $
60
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the maturity date on the 2020 Credit Facility was May 12, 2026. 
Starting in December 2022, borrowings on the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at rates based on either: 1) a fluctuating rate per annum determined to be the sum of Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a spread defined in the credit agreement (the "Spread"); or 2) a fixed rate per annum determined to be the sum of the Term SOFR plus the Spread. The Spread ranges from 
1.00
% to 
1.75
%, which is based on the Company’s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as defined in the credit agreement. In addition, the Company is currently subject to an unused commitment fee ranging from 
0.10
% and 
0.20
% on the unused amount of the line of credit, with the rate being based on the Company’s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).  
The borrowings made before December 2022 bore interest at rates based on either: 1) London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"); or 2) a specified base rate (determined by reference to the greatest of the prime rate published by Wells Fargo, the federal funds effective rate plus 
1.5
% and one-month LIBOR plus 
1.5
%), as selected periodically by the Company. The LIBOR-based loans bore interest at LIBOR plus the Spread. The unused commitment fee prior to the December 2022 amendment was the same.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
no
 outstanding balance and $
60,000
 undrawn and available under its amended 2020 Credit Facility. Unused commitment fee for the 2020 Credit Facility amounted to $

The 2020 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets.
The 2020 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability to, subject to various exceptions and qualifications: (i) incur liens; (ii) incur additional debt; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) merge with or acquire other companies, (v) make loans, advances or guarantees; (vi) make investments; (vii) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; and (viii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The 2020 Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum asset coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was compliant with all financial covenants.
On February 14, 2025, the 2020 Credit Facility was amended, extending the maturity 
five years
 to February 13, 2030, and amending the unused commitment fees to range from 
0.125
% to 
0.225
%.  
Vehicle Loans
The Company periodically enters into vehicle loans. Interest rate on these vehicle loans range from

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did 
not
 record liabilities relating to such legal matters.
Business Risk
—The Company imports finished goods predominantly from manufacturers located in South American and Southeast Asian countries. The Company may be subject to certain business risks due to potential instability in these regions.

One of the customers acquired less than 5% ownership in the Company upon consummation of the IPO. The same customer also vested in 
100,000
 restricted stock awards during the period ended March 31, 2023 as discussed in Note 10, Stockholders' Equity. The customer continues to hold less than 5% ownership in the Company as of December 31, 2024.
In 2023, the Company agreed to start to discontinue the private label coconut water and coconut oil supply relationship with one of the significant customers as the terms required to retain the business were contrary to the long term margin targets. However, at the request of this customer, the supply relationship continued for a significant portion of their private label coconut water needs in 2024. The Company expects the number of regions that the Company services for private label to decrease in 2025.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with the ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
("ASC 815"). These principles require that all derivative instruments be recognized at fair value on each balance sheet date unless they qualify for a scope exclusion as a normal purchase or sale transaction, which is accounted for under the accrual method of accounting. In addition, these principles permit derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting to reflect the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments through earnings or stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income on a net basis until the hedged item is settled and recognized in earnings, depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. The ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that it had designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, and therefore all changes in fair value were immediately recognized in earnings.
The Company is subject to the following currency risks:
Inventory purchases from Brazilian, Thai and Malaysian manufacturers—
In order to mitigate the currency risk on inventory purchases from its Brazilian, Malaysian and Thai manufacturers, which are settled in Brazilian real ("BRL"), Malaysian ringgit ("MYR") and Thai baht ("THB"), the Company's subsidiary, All Market Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("AMS"), enters a series of forward currency swaps to buy BRL, MYR and THB.
Intercompany transactions between AME and AMS—
In

order to mitigate the currency risk on intercompany transactions between AME and AMS, AMS enters into foreign currency swaps to sell British pound ("GBP").
Intercompany Transactions with Canadian Customer and Vendors—
In order to mitigate the currency risk on transactions with Canadian customer and vendors, the Company enters into foreign currency swaps to sell Canadian dollars ("CAD").
The notional amount and fair value of all outstanding derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets consist of the following at:

The Company applies recurring fair value measurements to its derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements 
("ASC 820"). In determining fair value, the Company used a market approach and incorporates the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable internally developed inputs.
13. 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 
(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
Based upon observability of the inputs used in valuation techniques, the Company’s assets and liabilities are classified as follows:
•
Level 1—
Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2—
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
•
Level 3—
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes internally developed models and methodologies utilizing significant unobservable inputs.
Forward currency swap contracts—
See Note 12, Derivative Instruments, for a description of these contracts. The Company’s valuation methodology for forward currency swap contracts is based upon third-party institution data.
The Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:
Level 1
Level 2

On October 30, 2023, the Board approved a share repurchase program ("Program") authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $
40,000
 of the Company's common stock. Shares of the Company's  common stock may be repurchased under the Program from time to time through open market purchases, block trades, private transactions or accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs. To the extent not retired, shares of the Company's common stock repurchased under the Program will be placed in the Company's treasury shares. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares of the Company's common stock, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company. The Program has no time limits and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company repurchased 
504,246

Stock-based Compensation
—
The stockholders of the Company approved the adoption of the Company’s 2014 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan allowed for a maximum of 
8
% of the sum of the Available Equity defined as the sum of (i) the total then outstanding shares of common shares and (ii) all available stock option (i.e., granted and outstanding stock options and stock options not yet granted). Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the Company may grant employees, directors, and consultants stock options and restricted stock awards and has the authority to establish the specific terms of each award, including exercise price, expiration, and vesting. Currently, only stock options were granted under the 2014 Plan. Generally, stock options issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan must contain exercise prices no less than the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and have a 
ten-year
 contractual term. 
Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the stockholders of the Company approved the adoption of the 2021 Incentive Award Plan ("2021 Plan"), which became effective after the closing of the IPO. On and after closing of the offering and the effectiveness of the 2021 Incentive Award Plan, no further grants will be made under the 2014 Plan. The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 
3,431,312
 shares of the Company's common stock and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in and including 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) two percent (
2
%) of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (B) such lesser amount as determined by the Board; provided, however, no more than 
3,431,312
 shares may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options, or ISOs. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including ISOs and nonqualified stock options, or NSOs, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, or RSUs, other incentive awards, SARs, and cash awards. Stock options, restricted stock, and RSU's were granted under 2021 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
3,254,762
 shares of the Company's common stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to the 2021 Plan.  
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $
8,771
, $
7,805
 and $
6,134
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company also recognized a reduction of revenue of $
151
, $
1,323
 and $
1,250
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to stock-based compensation awards granted to entities affiliated with a major customer that was accounted for as a stock-based sales incentive. The total impact to additional paid-in capital related to stock-based compensation arrangements in 2024 and 2023 were $
8,922
 and $

The weighted average grant-date fair value of the service-based stock option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
10.52
 per option and $
7.29
 per option, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of service-based stock options exercised was $
8,921
 and $
10,826
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock for all stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company’s common stock.
The fair value of the service-based stock options granted in 2024 and 2023 pursuant to the Stock Option Plan was estimated on a grant or on a modification date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Expected Term:
 Represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on a contractual term and service conditions specified for the awards. The Company estimated the expected term of the options with service conditions in accordance with the “simplified” method as defined in ASC 718, which enables the use of a practical expedient for “plain vanilla” share options.
Expected Volatility
: The Company has historically been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its stock. Therefore, the Company estimated volatility for option grants by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the option grant for a term that is approximately equal to the expected term of the options.
Risk-free Interest Rate:
 The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield, as of the option valuation date, by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant or the modification of the award for time periods equal to the expected term of the award.
Dividend Yield
—The Company does not anticipate declaring a dividend over the expected term. As such, the dividend yield has been estimated to be 
zero
.
Fair Value of Common Stock
— For stock awards granted subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the Company's common stock assumed for the grant date fair value of the awards will be based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the day of grant. Prior to the IPO in October 2021, because there has been no public market for the Company’s common stock, the Board has determined the estimated fair value of the Company's common stock at the time of grant of options by considering valuations performed by an independent third-party valuation specialist, which considers a number of objective and subjective factors including valuations of comparable companies, operating and

Stock Option Awards with Performance and Market-based Vesting Conditions
There are also stock option awards containing performance-based vesting conditions, subject to achievement of various performance goals by a future period, such as revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets. There are also stock option awards containing performance and market vesting conditions, such as options vesting upon occurrence of an IPO or other qualifying liquidity event and upon achieving a predetermined equity value of the Company. This award was granted to the current CEO in 2019 that vest upon occurrence of an IPO or other qualifying liquidity event and upon achieving a predetermined equity value of the Company. As of July 31, 2023, the performance and market vesting conditions were achieved and the remaining stock compensation expense of $
762
 for this award was accelerated and recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no modifications to these awards. During the year ended December 31, 2022, certain awards that contained a performance-based vesting condition were modified. The modification adjusted the performance condition to allow for 
50
% of the performance awards to meet the criteria to vest, and no other terms were modified. Since it did not affect any terms that would affect the fair value, and only the number of awards, it is considered an improbable-to-probable modification. The impact of the modification was not material.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, income taxes on undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have not been provided for as the Company plans to indefinitely reinvest these amounts. The cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
During 2021, the Finance Act 2021 (the "Finance Act") was enacted in the U.K. The Finance Act increases the corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023 and enhances the first-year capital allowance on qualifying new plant and machinery assets effective April 1, 2021. The effects on the Company’s existing deferred tax balances have been recorded.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by the Biden Administration, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states also reached an agreement to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's ("OECD") reform of international taxation known as GloBE, which broadly mirrors the Inflation Reduction Act by imposing a 15% global minimum tax on multinational companies. The impact of these changes was not material as of December 31, 2024.

(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)
•
Americas—The Americas segment is comprised primarily of the U.S. and Canada and derives its revenues from the marketing and distribution of various coconut water and non-coconut water products (e.g., coconut oil and milk). The Company’s guayusa leaf products (
Runa
), aluminum bottle canned water (
Ever & Ever
), and protein infused fitness drink (
PWR LIFT
) are or were, in the case of 
Runa
, marketed only in the Americas segment. As of December 2023, we ceased offering the 
Runa
 brand.
•
International—The International segment is comprised primarily of Europe, Middle East, and Asia Pacific, which includes the Company’s procurement arm and derives its revenues from the marketing and distribution of various coconut water and non-coconut water products, which in some cases may be shipped directly to customers outside of Asia Pacific regions. 
 The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and manages and allocates resources between the Americas and International segments. Consistent with this decision-making process, the CODM uses financial information disaggregated between the Americas and International segment for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. The CODM evaluates segment business performance based primarily on net sales and gross profit. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis for both profit measures when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments and also uses segment gross profit for evaluating product pricing.
All intercompany transactions between the segments have been eliminated.
Information about the Company’s operations by operating segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:

Because the Company was able to source guayusa through alternative means to produce the Runa products before the Company ceased offering this brand, as of September 30, 2022, the Company committed to a plan for disposal through sale. The Company performed a fair value assessment on the asset group held for sale consisting of land, a production plant, equipment and inventory. The Company obtained a valuation of the assets and adjusted the carrying amount down to their fair value less costs to sell, which resulted in a $
619
 impairment loss recorded in SG&A during the third quarter of 2022. These assets held for sale did not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. As of September 30, 2023, since the asset had been held for sale beyond one year, the Company has reclassified it as held and used within property, plant and equipment and remeasured it at its fair value of $
140
, which resulted in an additional $
363
 impairment loss. The remaining carrying amount was $
0
 as of December 31, 2024

and

December 31, 2023.

In June 2022, the Company extended its lease agreement for the New York office to April 30, 2025 and remeasured the lease liability and right-of-use asset as of June 30, 2022. The Company pays for its proportionate share of building operating costs such as maintenance, utilities, and insurance that are treated as variable costs and excluded from the measurement of the lease. 
In August 2024, the Company signed a lease agreement for a new office in New York, New York. The operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2025, ending in 2034 with an option to extend for an additional 
two years

920
 as restricted cash

included in Prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company signed a lease agreement for a new office in London, United Kingdom. The operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2025, ending in 2030. Total undiscounted future payments for this new office lease are $
1,554
.

Additionally, the Company agreed to establish a security deposit of $
109
, which is refundable at the end of the lease period. 
The Company also maintains additional leases for office space and equipment in London and Singapore, which are operating leases. On March 31, 2022, the Company renewed the lease for the Singapore office, extending it through June 30, 2025, which is reflected in the lease term.

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE
In accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, investments in entities over which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method, with the Company’s share of earnings or losses reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
Through one of its subsidiaries, the Company has a 
60
% joint venture interest in a company, Coco Ventures Limited, which provides for the development, marketing, distribution and branding of coconut water-based products under the Vita Coco brand in China. It is anticipated that Coco Ventures will initially purchase coconut water products from the Company. The Company acquired this interest on August 2, 2024, the date on which the Company obtained significant influence, for $
0.6
 million to be paid in cash within one year. The Company will record the initial investment in the joint venture upon cash payment. Since the Company is deemed not to have a controlling interest in Coco Ventures Limited, the Company’s investment will be accounted using the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323. As of December 31, 2024, Coco Ventures Limited had not completed any activity and had no operations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on this assessment, the management of the Company concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.
