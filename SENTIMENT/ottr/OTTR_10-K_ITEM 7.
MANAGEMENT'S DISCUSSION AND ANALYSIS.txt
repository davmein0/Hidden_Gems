ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing under 
Item 8
 of this Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into three segments: Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. Our Electric business is a vertically integrated, regulated utility with generation, transmission and distribution facilities to serve our customers in western Minnesota, eastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota. Our Manufacturing segment provides metal fabrication for custom machine parts and metal components, and manufactures extruded and thermoformed plastic products. Our Plastics segment manufactures PVC pipe for use in, among other applications, municipal and rural water, wastewater and water reclamation projects.

2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS
In 2024, our diversified business model generated record financial results, producing net income of $301.7 million, or $7.17 per diluted share, an increase of 3% from $294.2 million, or $7.00 per diluted share, in 2023. Our financial results for the year were driven by earnings growth in our Electric and Plastics segments, partially offset by a decline in our Manufacturing segment earnings. In 2024, we paid an annual dividend of $1.87 per share, or $78.3 million, completing our 86th consecutive year of dividend payments to our shareholders. 
Our Electric segment produced earnings growth of 8% in 2024, from $84.4 million in 2023 to $91.0 million in 2024, primarily due to increased retail revenue resulting from an interim rate increase in North Dakota and increased rider revenue, partially offset by the investment and financing costs associated with our rate base investments, resulting in increased depreciation and interest expense compared to the prior year.
Our Manufacturing segment earnings decreased 36% in 2024, from $21.5 million in 2023 to $13.7 million in 2024, primarily due to soft end market demand, which resulted in lower sales volumes and a decrease in gross profit margins in our plastics thermoforming business, partially offset by reduced general and administrative expenses. Decreased profit margins were primarily due to reduced leveraging of fixed manufacturing costs resulting from decreased production and sales volumes. 
Our Plastics segment produced earnings growth of 7%, from $187.7 million in 2023 to $200.7 million in 2024, primarily due to the impact of increased sales volumes, driven by strong customer and end market demand. Increased operating revenues, driven by increased sales volumes, were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margins. Gross profit margins decreased primarily due to decreases in sales prices, which outpaced decreases in the cost of PVC resin and other input materials.
Our earnings mix in 2024 was 30% from our Electric segment and 70% from the combination of our Manufacturing and Plastics segments including unallocated corporate costs. Since 2021, our earnings mix has diverged from our long-term target of 65% from our Electric segment and 35% from our Manufacturing Platform primarily due to market conditions within the PVC pipe industry. These conditions have led to significant revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in our Plastics segment. Currently, we expect these industry conditions to gradually normalize through 2027. As they do, we expect earnings and cash flow generation within our Plastics segment to moderate from current levels and our earnings mix to return to our long-term targeted mix. 
PVC PIPE MARKET CONDITIONS
Extraordinary supply and demand conditions in the PVC industry beginning in 2021 have led to a significant expansion in operating margins and elevated earnings in our Plastics segment over the past four years. Periodic disruptions in the supply of PVC resin, the primary material input used in the manufacturing of PVC pipe, coupled with robust demand for resin, led to a significant increase in the cost of resin beginning in 2021. During this time, robust end market demand for PVC pipe led to a rapid and significant increase in sales prices for the product, significantly outpacing the increase in resin input costs, leading to increased operating margins within our Plastics segment. PVC pipe prices and resin costs reached historic levels, peaking in 2022. Sales prices have steadily declined since the third quarter of 2022, a trend that continued throughout 2024; however, operating margins remain elevated relative to historical levels.
In the second half of 2022, our sales volumes declined in response to uncertain and competitive market conditions, which continued through the first half of 2023. Robust infrastructure investment plans, particularly in water supply, sewage, and drainage systems, and increased construction activity drove strong distributor and end market demand for PVC pipe beginning in the second half of 2023 and those trends continued throughout 2024.
The market dynamics impacting our Plastics segment resulted in a significant increase in earnings in the last four years compared to historical levels. We anticipate PVC pipe sales prices will continue to decline over time; however, future supply and demand dynamics, as well as other factors, could impact future product prices. We anticipate PVC pipe prices will gradually normalize through 2027. The marketplace dynamics impacting our Plastics segments are fluid and subject to change and may impact our operating results prospectively.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER METRICS
Heating Degree Days (HDDs)
 is a measure of how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), the outside air temperature was below a certain normalized level. Normal weather conditions are defined as the 20-year average of actual historical weather conditions. This measure is commonly used in calculations relating to the energy consumption required to heat buildings.
Cooling Degree Days (CDDs)
 is a measure of how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), the outside air temperature was above a certain normalized level. This measure is commonly used in calculations relating to the energy consumption required to cool buildings.
32
Table of Contents
OTP generally bases its forecasted kwh sales and rates on expected consumption under a normal level of HDDs and CDDs over a given period of time in its service territory. Increased or decreased levels of consumption for certain customer classifications are attributed to deviation from the norms and are a significant factor influencing consumption of electricity across our service territory. We present HDDs and CDDs to provide an indication of the impact of weather on kwh sales, revenues and earnings relative to forecast, and on period-to-period results.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
For a comparison of fiscal year 2023 to 2022, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our report on 
Form 10-K
 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024.
Provided below is a summary and discussion of our operating results on a consolidated basis followed by a discussion of the operating results of each of our segments, Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. In addition to the segment results, we provide an overview of our Corporate costs. Our Corporate costs do not constitute a reportable segment, but rather consist of unallocated general corporate expenses, such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of our captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of segment performance. Corporate costs are added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on our consolidated statements of income.

Operating Revenues 
decreased $18.6 million on a consolidated basis in 2024. Electric segment operating revenues decreased 1% primarily due to decreased fuel recovery and wholesale revenues and the impact of unfavorable weather, partially offset by retail revenue increases due to an interim rate increase in North Dakota in connection with our most recent rate case, as well as increased commercial and industrial sales volumes, and increased rider revenue. Manufacturing segment operating revenues decreased 15% primarily due to lower sales volumes due to soft end market demand across most end markets. Plastics segment operating revenues increased 11% primarily due to increased sales volumes driven by strong customer demand, partially offset by a decrease in sales prices. See our segment disclosures below for additional discussion of items impacting operating revenues.
Operating Expenses 
decreased $20.9 million in 2024. Electric segment operating expenses decreased primarily due to decreased purchased power costs resulting from lower market energy prices. Operating expenses in our Manufacturing segment decreased primarily due to decreased sales volumes, as discussed above. Operating expenses in our Plastics segment increased primarily due to increased sales volumes, as discussed above. See our segment disclosures below for additional discussion of items impacting operating expenses.
Interest Expense 
increased $4.1 million in 2024 due to the issuance of an additional $120.0 million of long-term debt at OTP in March, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings, fund capital expenditures and support operating activities.
Other Income 
increased $6.2 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in investment income earned on our short-term cash equivalent investments and our long-term fixed income investments.
Income Tax Expense 
decreased $4.1 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in PTCs produced by our wind and solar generation assets. Our effective tax rate was 17.8% in 2024 and 19.1% in 2023. See

Retail Revenue 
decreased $2.6 million primarily due to the following:
•
A $13.4 million decrease in fuel recovery revenues, primarily due to lower purchased power costs, as described below.
•
A $8.1 million decrease in base revenues from the unfavorable impact of weather compared to last year.
The decreases in retail revenue described above were partially offset by the following:
•    A $12.4 million increase from an interim rate increase in North Dakota, effective January 1, 2024, in connection with our most recent rate case.
•    A $3.2 million increase in rider revenues, including recovery of our continued investments in advanced metering and outage management systems and wind repowering projects.
•
Increased sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers, the mix of customer rates compared to the prior year and other factors.

Table of Contents
Purchased Power
 costs to serve retail customers decreased $16.7 million due to a 17% decrease in the price of purchased power, primarily due to decreased market energy costs, as well as a 5% decrease in the volume of purchased power primarily due to decreased demand resulting from unfavorable weather.
Operating and Maintenance

Expense
 decreased $0.8 million primarily due to decreased vegetative maintenance, outage, transmission tariff and insurance costs, partially offset by increased labor, software and environmental protection costs. 
Depreciation and Amortization
 expense increased $6.8 million primarily due to the placing in service of our metering infrastructure project throughout the year, a full year of depreciation recognized for Hoot Lake Solar, which was placed in service in August 2023, and continued investments in distribution facilities during the year.
Property Taxes
 decreased $1.0 million due to lower taxes associated with certain wind farm facilities in North Dakota due to a revision of the tax methodology applied to the property and lower taxes in Minnesota.
Interest Expense 
increased $4.4 million due to the issuance of an additional $120.0 million of long-term debt in March, partially offset by lower interest on short-term borrowings due to lower average borrowings and interest rates compared to the prior year.
Income Tax Expense 
decreased $3.2 million due to an increase in PTCs produced by our wind and solar generation assets, partially attributable to Hoot Lake Solar going into service in August 2023.

Operating Revenues
 decreased $60.2 million primarily due to a 15% decrease in sales volumes, with declines experienced in the recreational vehicle, agriculture, construction, lawn and garden, and horticulture end markets. Sales volumes decreased due to lower end market demand and inventory management efforts by manufacturers, distributors and dealers. A 28% decline in scrap metal revenues, largely driven by lower production volumes, also contributed to the decrease in operating revenues. 
Cost of Products Sold
 decreased $42.7 million primarily due to lower sales volumes, as described above. In response to declines in end market demand and decreased sales volumes, we reduced our headcount and operating hours and placed employees on temporary furlough during the year, which also reduced our costs. These decreases were partially offset by reduced leveraging of fixed manufacturing costs resulting from the decreased production and sales volumes.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
 decreased $9.3 million primarily due to decreased employee compensation costs resulting from a decrease in headcount and lower variable compensation driven by financial performance in the current year.
Depreciation and Amortization
 increased $1.9 million due to capital expenditures during the year, which included investments in facility improvements and purchases of equipment.

Operating Revenues 
increased $45.4 million primarily due to a 27% increase in sales volumes driven by customer sales volume growth and strong distributor and end market demand. Sales volumes in 2023 were negatively impacted by distributors and contractors reducing purchase volumes in response to uncertain and competitive market conditions. Although market conditions remain somewhat uncertain, infrastructure investment and active construction across our sales territories contributed to increased distributor and end market demand in 2024. The impact of increased sales volumes was partially offset by decreased sales prices. Our sales prices have steadily declined after peaking in late 2022 and decreased 12% in 2024 compared to the prior year due to continuing changes in market conditions.  
Cost of Products Sold
 increased $23.1 million primarily due to increased sales volumes, as described above. The supply and demand conditions for PVC resin experienced in recent years appear to have normalized and resin costs were less volatile throughout the year than they were in the recent past. The cost of PVC resin and other input materials decreased 13% compared to the prior year, partially offsetting the impact of increased sales volumes. 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
increased $4.3 million due to costs associated with ongoing litigation regarding the pricing of PVC pipe, which is further described in 
Note 1

 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as increased variable costs associated with our increase in sales volumes and current year financial performance.

(2)
 A compliance filing affirming the implementation date, revenue requirement, return on rate base, allowed return on equity, and equity ratio was made on February 7, 2025, and remained subject to final approval by the NDPSC as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.
(3)
 Includes an earnings sharing mechanism to share with South Dakota customers any weather-normalized earnings above the authorized ROE of 8.75%. The mechanism requires 50% of any weather-normalized revenue creating annual earnings in excess of the authorized ROE up to a maximum of 9.50% be returned to customers and 100% returns of revenue creating annual earnings above 9.50%.
North Dakota Rate Case: 
On November 2, 2023, OTP filed a request with the NDPSC for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in North Dakota. In its filing, OTP requested a net increase in annual revenue of $17.4 million, or 8.4%, based on an allowed rate of return on rate base of 7.85% and an allowed rate of ROE of 10.6% on an equity ratio of 53.5% of total capital. The filing also included an interim rate request of a net increase in annual revenue of $12.4 million, or 6.0%, which was approved by the NDPSC on December 13, 2023. Interim rates went into effect on January 1, 2024. On July 3, 2024, OTP filed an update to the original request increasing the amount of the net annual revenue requirement increase from $17.4 million to $22.5 million, or a net increase of 10.9% in annual revenue, to account for certain items identified throughout the regulatory process. 
On December 30, 2024, the NDPSC approved a settlement agreement between OTP and certain interested parties in the general rate case and issued its written order on final rates. The key provisions of the order include a revenue requirement of $225.6 million, based on a return on rate base of 7.53%, and an allowed ROE of 10.10% on an equity ratio of 53.5%. The net annual revenue requirement includes a net increase of $13.1 million, or 6.18%. OTP’s revenue requirement was reduced by approximately $3.0 million primarily due to the inclusion of forecasted PTCs plus adjustments for new customer load additions, which were not included in OTP’s updated request filed on July 3, 2024. Through the settlement of the case, the parties also agreed to establish an earnings sharing mechanism, whereby 70% of actual earnings in excess of a 10.20% ROE would be returned to customers, with OTP retaining the remaining 30%.

RESOURCE PLANNING
Minnesota
In May 2024, the MPUC approved OTP’s 2023 to 2037 IRP. Consistent with MPUC practice, the decision was made during deliberations by oral vote and was finalized in a written order issued in July 2024.
The MPUC:
•
Directed OTP to procure the following generation resources, subject to additional regulatory review and approval:
◦
200 to 300 MW of solar generation by November 1, 2027, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
◦
150 to 200 MW of wind generation by December 31, 2029, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
◦
20 to 75 MW of battery storage by December 31, 2029, or as soon as practicable thereafter;
•
Approved the project to add on-site liquified natural gas storage at our Astoria Station natural gas plant by 2027;
•
Directed OTP to designate the Minnesota share of the jointly owned Coyote Station coal-fired plant as an Available Maximum Emergency (AME) resource beginning in 2026 and ending no later than December 2031. If the designation as an AME resource is found to not be feasible, then Minnesota customers shall not continue to pay for or depend on capacity or energy from Coyote Station past 2028; and
•
Directed OTP to commence activities to no longer serve Minnesota customers with capacity or energy from Coyote Station as soon as feasible and no later than December 31, 2031.

Under the MPUC’s order, OTP will file its next IRP in May 2026. In this filing, the company will include, among other options, an analysis considering the continued operation of Big Stone Plant with AME.
North Dakota
In December 2024, the NDPSC issued its final order on OTP's IRP. The order stipulated that the commission does not support the addition of new wind or solar generation or battery storage through 2030. Therefore, none of the costs or benefits of the new renewable and battery storage assets in OTP's IRP approved by the MPUC will be assigned to North Dakota customers, including any that may be physically located in North Dakota. In addition, at an informal hearing in July 2024, the NDPSC denied our request for an Advanced Determination of Prudence (ADP) for the on-site liquified natural gas storage at Astoria Station, a project that was part of OTP's IRP approved by the MPUC. We continue to evaluate the benefits of on-site fuel storage at Astoria Station and the development of this project in the future.
LIQUIDITY
LIQUIDITY OVERVIEW
We believe our financial condition is strong and our cash and cash equivalents, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and borrowing ability, because of investment-grade credit ratings, when taken together, provide us ample liquidity to conduct business operations, fund our capital expenditure program and satisfy our obligations as they become due. Our liquidity, including our operating cash flows and access to capital markets, could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control, including higher interest rates and debt capital costs, and diminished credit availability. In addition, our liquidity could be impacted by non-compliance with certain financial covenants under our various debt instruments. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants (see the Financial Covenant section under Capital Resources below).
The following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of December 31, 2024:

OTC and OTP are each party to separate credit agreements (the OTC Credit Agreement and OTP Credit Agreement, respectively) which provide for unsecured revolving lines of credit. Should additional liquidity be needed, the OTC Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature allowing us to increase the amount available to $290 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The OTP Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature allowing OTP to increase that facility to $300 million, subject to certain terms and conditions.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $311.6 million of available liquidity under our credit agreements and $294.7 million of available cash and cash equivalents, resulting in total available liquidity of $606.3 million, compared to total available liquidity of $479.8 million as of December 31, 2023.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
 increased $48.2 million primarily due to a decrease in working capital and increased net income. In our Plastics segment, sales and related receivable balances were less volatile than the prior year where sales and related receivable balances increased in the later part of the year. This resulted in decreased working capital in the current year compared to the prior year. Working capital also decreased due to an increase in payables in our Electric segment, due to the timing of capital investment spending, and decreases in receivables and inventories in our Manufacturing segment, due to decreased sales and production volumes during the later part of the current year.
Market dynamics experienced by our Plastics segment businesses in 2024 and 2023 resulted in a significant increase in our overall cash from operations compared to prior periods. We anticipate our cash from operations in future years will decline from current levels consistent with the anticipated decline in Plastics segment earnings.

 increased $26.8 million compared to the prior year. Financing activities during the year included the issuance of $120.0 million of long-term debt at OTP, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings under the OTP credit agreement, fund Electric segment construction expenditures and support operating activities. We manage the capital structure of OTP independently from our consolidated financial position to ensure compliance with the capital structure approved through regulation; therefore, our decision to issue long-term debt at OTP is not impacted by our consolidated cash and cash equivalent position.
Financing activities during the year also included net repayments of short-term debt of $11.8 million compared to net short-term borrowings of $73.2 million in 2023, and in 2024, we made dividend payments of $78.3 million compared to $73.1 million in 2023.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Our capital expenditure plan includes investments in electric generation facilities, transmission and distribution lines and facilities, manufacturing facilities and upgrades, equipment used in the manufacturing process, and computer hardware and information systems. Our capital expenditure plan is subject to review and is revised in light of changes in demands for energy, technology, environmental laws, regulatory approvals, business expansion opportunities, the costs of labor, materials and equipment, and our overall financial condition.
The following provides a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for our Electric segment and non-electric businesses and anticipated capital expenditures for the five-year period 2025 through 2029:

Coal contract obligations are based on estimated coal consumption and costs for the delivery of coal to Coyote Station from Coyote Creek Mining Company (CCMC) under the Lignite Sales Agreement (LSA) that ends in 2040. Postretirement benefit obligations include estimated cash expenditures for the payment of retiree medical and life insurance benefits and supplemental pension benefits under our unfunded Executive Survivor and Supplemental Retirement Plan (ESSRP), but do not include amounts to fund our noncontributory funded pension plan, as we are not currently required to make any contributions to that plan. OTP also has contractual agreements for the purchase of capacity and wind-generated energy. Generally, the terms of OTP's wind power purchase agreements require OTP to purchase all of the electricity generated by a particular wind farm, but do not include fixed or minimum payments. 
On October 30, 2024, OTP entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of a solar facility currently under development. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price is equal to $23.6 million, plus the reimbursement of certain interconnection costs and costs to purchase and store the main power transformer. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in late 2025 or early 2026.
COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS
We paid dividends to our shareholders totaling $78.3 million, or $1.87 per share, in 2024. The determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be paid will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, our actual or expected level of earnings and cash flows from operations, the level of our capital expenditures and our future business prospects. As a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements, restrictions could occur on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by OTC subsidiaries to OTC. These intercompany distributions serve as the primary source of funding for dividends paid to our shareholders. See 
Note 1
5
 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-K for additional information. The decision to declare a dividend is reviewed quarterly by our Board of Directors. On February 4, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.525 per common share.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows, unused lines of credit, access to capital markets and alternative financing arrangements such as leasing. Debt financing will be required in the five-year period from 2025 through 2029 to refinance maturing debt and to finance our planned capital investments. Our financing plans are subject to change and are impacted by our planned level of capital investments, decisions to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit, to refund or retire early any of our presently outstanding debt, to complete acquisitions or to use capital for other purposes. 
REGISTRATION STATEMENTS
On May 3, 2024, we filed two registration statements with the SEC, replacing two previously filed registration statements upon their expiration. The first statement, a shelf registration, allows us to offer for sale, from time to time, either separately or together in any combination, equity, debt or other securities described in the registration statement. No new equity, debt, or other securities have been issued pursuant to this registration statement. The second registration statement allows for the issuance of up to 1,500,000 common shares under our Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, which provides our common shareholders, retail customers of OTP and other interested investors a method of purchasing our common shares by reinvesting their dividends and/or making optional cash investments. Shares purchased under the plan may be newly issued common shares or common shares purchased on the open market. As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,429,531 shares available for purchase or issuance under the plan. Both registration statements expire in May 2027.

SHORT-TERM DEBT
The OTC Credit Agreement and OTP Credit Agreement provide for unsecured revolving lines of credit. In December 2024, the credit agreements were amended to extend the maturity date of each credit facility and amend certain financial covenants. The OTP Credit Agreement was also amended to increase the borrowing limit. The agreements generally bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable credit spread, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of the borrower. The weighted-average interest rate on all outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 5.61% and 6.70%.

LONG-TERM DEBT 
In March 2024, OTP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which OTP issued, in a private placement transaction, $120.0 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of (a) $60.0 million of 5.48% Series 2024A Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2034, and (b) $60.0 million of 5.77% Series 2024B Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2054. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay existing short-term borrowings, fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $947.0 million of principal outstanding under long-term debt arrangements.

Financial Covenants
Our short- and long-term debt agreements require OTC and OTP to maintain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants as further described below: 
OTC,
 under its financial covenants, may not permit its ratio of interest-bearing debt to total capitalization to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 or 0.65 to 1.00, depending on the debt agreement, may not permit its interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 and may not permit its priority indebtedness to exceed 10% of our total capitalization. As of December 31, 2024, OTC's interest-bearing debt to total capitalization was 0.38 to 1.00, OTC's interest and dividend coverage ratio was 10.00 to 1.00 and OTC had no priority indebtedness outstanding.
OTP,
 under its financial covenants, may not permit its ratio of interest-bearing debt to total capitalization to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 or 0.65 to 1.00, depending on the debt agreement, may not permit its interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 and may not permit its priority indebtedness to exceed 20% of its total capitalization. As of December 31, 2024, OTP's interest-bearing debt to total capitalization was 0.47 to 1.00, OTP's interest and dividend coverage ratio was 3.34 to 1.00 and OTP had no priority indebtedness outstanding. 
None of our debt agreements include any provisions that would trigger an acceleration of the related debt as a result of changes in the credit rating levels assigned to the related obligor by rating agencies.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
The discussion and analysis of our results of operations are based on financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. While we believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are based on the best available information, they are subject to future events and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore actual results may materially differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and the development of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
REGULATORY ACCOUNTING
Our utility business is subject to regulation of rates and other matters by state utility commissions in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota and by the FERC for certain interstate operations. Accordingly, our utility business must adhere to the accounting requirements of regulated operations, which requires the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for amounts that otherwise would impact the statements of income or comprehensive income when it is probable that such amounts will be collected from customers or credited to customers through the rate-making process. This guidance also provides recognition criteria for adjustments to rates outside of a general rate case proceeding, which are provided to encourage or incentivize investments in certain areas such as conservation, renewable energy, pollution reduction or control, improved infrastructure of the transmission grid or other programs that provide benefits to the general public under public policy, laws or regulations. Regulatory assets generally represent costs that have been incurred but have been deferred because future recovery from customers, as established through the rate-making process, is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts to be refunded to customers or amounts currently collected from customers for future costs. 
We assess the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and the obligations arising from regulatory liabilities on a quarterly basis. Our probability estimates incorporate numerous factors, including recent rate making decisions, historical precedents for similar matters, the regulatory environments in which we operate and the impact these incurred costs may have on our customers. Changes in our assessments regarding the likelihood of recovery or settlement of our regulatory assets and liabilities may have a material impact on our operating results and financial position. Further, if we determine that all or a portion of our utility business no longer meets the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, or our regulators disallow recovery of a previously incurred cost or eliminate a regulatory liability, we would be required to remove the associated regulatory assets and liabilities from our consolidated balance sheets and recognize those amounts in the consolidated statements of income as an expense or income item, or in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a loss or gain, in the period in which this accounting treatment is no longer applicable.   
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had regulatory assets of $108.6 million and $111.8 million and regulatory liabilities of $318.2 million and $302.0 million. If future recovery of amounts recorded as regulatory assets was no longer probable, we would be required to recognize an expense or loss in the period in which recovery was deemed to no longer be probable.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS AND COSTS
Pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and expenses are determined by actuaries using numerous assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected return on plan assets, a rate of compensation increase and healthcare cost-trend rates. See 
Note 1
1
 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-K for additional information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.
These benefits, for any individual employee, can be earned and related expenses can be recognized and a liability accrued over periods of up to 30 or more years. These benefits can be paid out for up to 40 or more years after an employee retires. Estimates of liabilities and expenses related to these benefits are among our most critical accounting estimates. Although deferral and amortization of fluctuations in actuarially determined benefit obligations and expenses are provided for when actual results on a year-to-year basis deviate from long-range assumptions, compensation increases and healthcare cost increases or a reduction in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly increase our benefit expenses in the year of the change. Likewise, compensation decreases and healthcare cost decreases or an increase in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly decrease our benefit expenses in the year of the change. Also, a change in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets in our funded pension plan or realized rates of return on plan assets that are well above or below assumed rates of return or a change in the anticipated life expectancy of plan participants could result in significant increases or decreases in recognized pension benefit expenses in the year of the change or for many years thereafter because actuarial losses can be amortized over the average remaining service lives of active employees.
43
Table of Contents
We estimate the discount rate through the use of a hypothetical bond portfolio method, which incorporates yields on a collection of high credit quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to our anticipated future benefit payments. We estimate the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets based on asset category studies using historical market returns achieved by our asset portfolio allocation over long-term periods, as well as long-term projected return levels. Other assumptions are developed by reference to available trend or historical data adjusted as necessary for future expectations.  
On December 31, 2024, the discount rates used to measure our pension plan and postretirement healthcare obligations were 5.70% and 5.61%, a thirteen and eight basis point increase, respectively, from the estimates used on December 31, 2023. Our estimates used to determine benefit cost for 2024 included a discount rate of 5.57% for pension benefits and 5.53% for postretirement healthcare costs, a six and one basis point increase, respectively, from 2023 estimates. In addition, we estimated our assumed rate of return on pension assets to be 7.00% for 2024, which was unchanged from our 2023 estimate. 
The following table summarizes the impact on 2024 pension and postretirement costs for a 25 basis point increase or decrease, holding all other variables constant, on certain key assumptions:

For 2025, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit income to be $4.3 million compared to $8.5 million of income in 2024 due to the impacts of updated actuarial assumptions. See additional information at 
Note 11
 of the consolidated financial statements.  
Subsequent increases or decreases in actual rates of return on plan assets over assumed rates, increases or decreases in the discount rate, increases in future compensation levels and increases in retiree healthcare cost inflation rates could significantly change projected costs.
We believe the estimates made for our pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known at the point in time the estimates are made. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are subject to change.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment and more frequently as events or circumstances require. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. We have identified two reporting units which carry a material amount of goodwill, BTD Manufacturing, our contract metal fabrication business, and our Plastics segment. As of December 31, 2024, BTD Manufacturing and our Plastics segment carried a goodwill balance of $18.1 million and $19.3 million, respectively.
We historically tested goodwill for impairment as of December 31st each year; however, in 2024, we elected to change the date of our annual goodwill impairment test to October 1st. We believe this new testing date allows us to better align our annual goodwill impairment testing procedures with our year-end financial reporting, as well as our annual budgeting and forecasting process. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid the recognition of an impairment charge.
The goodwill impairment test is a single-step quantitative assessment which compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value in an amount that is equal to the excess but limited to the amount of recorded goodwill of the reporting unit. An optional qualitative impairment assessment may be performed prior to, and may eliminate the need to perform, the quantitative assessment.
Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative impairment method requires significant judgments and estimates. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using income and market approaches. Our income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to arrive at a fair value estimate by determining the present value of projected future cash flows over a specified period plus a terminal value to reflect cash flows beyond the projection period. The discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows reflects our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable entities. Our market approach includes estimating the fair value of our reporting units by reference to various market indications of value, including fair value estimates using multiples derived from comparable enterprise values to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of select peer companies, and, if available, comparable sales transactions for comparative peer companies.
Our discounted cash flow methodology incorporates significant estimates, which include assumptions of future operating results and cash flows, which are impacted by economic and industry conditions, the amount and timing of estimated capital expenditures, an 
44
Table of Contents
estimated terminal growth rate and the selection of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, among others. Our market approaches require significant judgment in selecting comparable peer companies and comparable sales transactions and from these peer groups selecting an appropriate EBITDA multiple and indication of fair value. In addition, weighting the indications of fair value between the income and market approaches to arrive at a single fair value estimate for each reporting unit also requires judgment. 
Our goodwill impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2024 indicated no impairment was present for either reporting unit and the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the respective carrying value. As part of our testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses to understand if our conclusions are sensitive to changes in certain assumptions. A 3% decrease in projected operating revenues, a one hundred basis point decrease in projected gross profit margins, a one hundred basis point decrease in projected terminal growth rate, a 50 basis point increase in weighted-average cost of capital or a 1.0x decrease in the assumed EBITDA multiple would not lead to a goodwill impairment charge for either reporting unit. 
We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on the best information available. However, these estimates and assumptions include an inherent degree of uncertainty. Significant adverse changes in our expectations for any of these estimates could result in an impairment charge in a future period which may materially impact our operating results and financial position.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We are primarily exposed to commodity price and interest rate risk.
Commodity Price Risk
Our Electric segment business is exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices for wholesale energy and natural gas. OTP purchases energy in the wholesale market to supplement its own electricity generation and to respond to changes in demand and variability in generating plant output. In addition, OTP procures natural gas as a fuel source for its combustion turbine peaking facilities. OTP's exposure to price risk for these commodities is largely mitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which generally allows recovery of purchased power and fuel costs from our electric customers. 
OTP, where prudent, seeks to further manage its exposure to commodity price variability and reduce volatility in prices for its retail customers through the use of derivative instruments, primarily financial swap agreements. OTP does not engage in derivative and hedging activities for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2024, OTP was party to financial swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 167,200 megawatt-hours of electricity with various settlement dates throughout 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate fair value of these instruments was $2.0 million, reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Holding other variables constant, a ten percent change in energy prices would have had an approximate $0.9 million impact on the fair value of these instruments. 
Our Manufacturing and Plastics segment businesses are exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices for certain raw material inputs, including steel, aluminum and PVC and other plastic resins. We manage commodity price risk by attempting to pass changes in the cost of these input materials through to our customers. If our efforts to manage commodity price risk are unsuccessful, the operating revenues and earnings of our Manufacturing and Plastics segment could be impacted.
We do not engage in any hedging activities within our Manufacturing and Plastics segments to manage our commodity price risk.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our outstanding short-term debt which is subject to variable rates of interest based on benchmark interest rates, primarily SOFR, and our cash equivalent investments, which earn income at a rate that fluctuates daily, based on changes in U.S. treasury rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $69.6 million and $81.4 million of short-term debt outstanding. Holding other variables constant, a 100 basis point change in interest rates during 2024 would have had an approximate $0.4 million impact to interest expense in 2024 based on our average outstanding short-term debt during the year. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $282.0 million and $219.7 million invested in cash equivalent investments. Holding other variables constant, a 100 basis point change in the average interest rates during 2024 would have had an approximate $2.3 million impact to our investment income in 2024, based on our average outstanding investment balance during the year. 
All of our outstanding long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 had fixed interest rates and were not subject to material interest rate risk. We manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed-rate debt with varying maturities, by limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt and the utilization of short-term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long-term debt.
We have not used hedging instruments to manage interest risk arising from our portfolio of borrowings. We maintain a ratio of fixed-rate debt to total debt within a certain range. It is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions and other financial 
45
Table of Contents
instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our stated objectives. We do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Otter Tail Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Otter Tail Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we 
47
Table of Contents
are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Regulatory Matters—Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements—Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s regulated Electric segment accounts for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations. This guidance allows for the recording of a regulatory asset or liability for certain costs or credits which otherwise would be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the cost will be recovered or returned in future rates. This guidance also provides for adjustments to rates outside of a general rate case proceeding to encourage or incentivize investments in certain areas such as conservation, renewable energy, pollution reduction or control, improved infrastructure of the transmission grid or other programs that provide benefits to the general public under public policy, laws or regulations.
The Company is subject to regulation of rates and other matters by state and federal regulatory agencies (collectively, the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. The Company assesses the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and the obligations arising from regulatory liabilities on a quarterly basis. Probability estimates incorporate numerous factors, including recent rate making decisions, historical precedents for similar matters, the regulatory environments in which the Company operates, and the impact that incurred costs may have on customers.
There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include the recording of regulatory assets for certain costs which otherwise would be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the costs will be recovered in future rates and the recording of regulatory liabilities for certain credits which would otherwise be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the amount will be returned to customers in future rates. Given that management’s accounting judgements are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities, the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates, and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.
•
We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.
•
We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•
We obtained an analysis from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

OTTER TAIL CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Overview
Otter Tail Corporation (OTC) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company," "us," "our" or "we") form a diverse, multi-platform business consisting of a vertically integrated, regulated utility with generation, transmission and distribution facilities complemented by manufacturing businesses providing metal fabrication for custom machine parts and metal components, manufacturing of extruded and thermoformed plastic products, and manufacturing of PVC pipe products. We classify our business into 
three
 segments: Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. Note 2 includes an additional description of the segments and financial information regarding each segment.
Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of OTC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation except, as applicable, profits on sales to our regulated electric utility company from our nonregulated businesses, which is in accordance with the accounting requirements of regulated operations.
Use of Estimates
We use estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations. As better information becomes available or actual amounts are known, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
Regulatory Accounting
Our regulated electric utility company, OTP, is subject to regulation of rates and other matters by state utility commissions in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota and by the FERC for certain interstate operations. OTP accounts for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. This guidance allows for the recording of a regulatory asset for certain costs which otherwise would be recognized in the statements of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the cost will be recovered in future rates. This guidance also requires the recording of a regulatory liability for certain credits which would otherwise be recognized in the statements of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the amount will be returned to customers in future rates. Amounts recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are generally recognized in the statements of income at the time they are reflected in customer rates. In the event OTP ceases to meet the criteria to apply the guidance for regulated operations, the regulatory assets and liabilities that no longer meet such criteria would be removed from the consolidated balance sheets and included in the consolidated statements of income as an expense or income item, or in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a loss or gain item, in the period in which the application of this guidance ceases.
Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturity dates of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Deposits
We hold deposits with financial institutions which potentially subject us to a concentration risk. These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to an insurance limit of $250,000. Currently, our cash deposits exceed federally insured levels.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Due to our diverse business operations, the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers depends on the product produced and sold or service performed. We recognize revenue from contracts with customers at prices that are fixed or determinable as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, when we have met our performance obligation under the contract and it is probable that we will collect the amount to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred or to be transferred to the customer. Depending on the product produced and sold or service performed and the terms of the agreement with the customer, we recognize revenue either over time, in the case of delivery or transmission of electricity or related services or the production and storage of certain custom-made products, or at a point in time for the delivery of standardized products and other products made to customer specifications where the terms of the contract require transfer of the completed product. Provisions for sales returns, early payment discounts and volume-based variable pricing incentives are recorded as reductions to revenue at the time revenue is recognized based on customer history, historical information and current trends. We include revenues received for shipping and handling in operating revenues. Expenses paid for shipping and handling are recorded as part of cost of products sold. Sales or other taxes collected from customers are excluded from operating revenues.

Table of Contents
Electric Segment Revenues. 
Most Electric segment revenues are earned from the generation, transmission and sale of electricity to retail customers at rates approved by state regulatory commissions. OTP also earns revenue from the transmission of electricity for others over the transmission assets it owns separately or jointly with other transmission service providers, under rate tariffs established by the independent transmission system operator and approved by FERC. A third source of revenue for OTP comes from the generation and sale of electricity to wholesale customers at contract or market rates. Revenues from all these sources meet the criteria to be classified as revenue from contracts with customers and are recognized over time as energy is delivered or transmitted. Revenue is recognized based on the metered quantity of electricity delivered or transmitted at the applicable rates. For electricity delivered and consumed after a meter is read but not yet billed to a customer, OTP records revenue and an unbilled receivable based on estimates of the amount of energy delivered and a composite rate per kwh consumed.
Manufacturing Segment Revenues. 
Our Manufacturing segment businesses earn revenue predominantly from the production and delivery of custom-made or standardized parts and products to customers across several industries and from the production and sale of tools and dies to other manufacturers. For the production and delivery of standardized products and other products made to customer specifications where the terms of the contract require transfer of the completed product, we have met our performance obligation and recognize revenue at the point in time when the product is shipped. At this point we have no further obligation to provide services related to such products. The shipping terms used in these transactions are free on board (FOB) shipping point.
Plastics Segment Revenues. 
Our

Plastics segment businesses earn revenue predominantly from the sale and delivery of standardized PVC pipe products produced at their manufacturing facilities. Revenue from the sale of these products is recognized at the point in time when the product is shipped as there is no further obligation to provide services related to such products and the shipping terms are FOB shipping point. We have one customer within our Plastics segment for which we produce and store a product made to the customer’s specifications and design under a build and hold agreement. For sales to this customer, we recognize revenue as the custom-made product is produced, adjusting the amount of revenue for volume rebate variable pricing considerations we expect the customer will earn and applicable early payment discounts we expect the customer will take. Ownership of the pipe transfers to the customer prior to delivery and we are paid a negotiated fee for storage of the pipe. Revenue for storage of the pipe is recognized over time as the pipe is stored.
Alternative Revenue
In addition to recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, our Electric segment business also records revenue under alternative revenue program (ARP) requirements. Certain rate rider mechanisms qualify as ARP revenues as they provide for adjustments to rates outside of a general rate case proceeding to encourage or incentivize investments in certain areas such as conservation, renewable energy, pollution reduction or control, improved infrastructure of the transmission grid or other programs that provide benefits to the general public under public policy, laws or regulations. ARP riders generally provide for the recovery of specified costs and investments and include an incentive component to provide the regulated utility with a return on amounts invested.  
We accrue ARP revenue on the basis of costs incurred, investments made and returns on those investments that qualify for recovery through established riders. ARP revenue is disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers and we have elected to report ARP revenue on a net basis, whereby amounts initially recorded as ARP revenue in a period are presented net of the reversal of amounts previously recognized as ARP revenue that are reclassified and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers when such amounts are included in the price of electricity to customers.
Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
We grant credit to our customers in the normal course of business with repayment terms generally ranging from 30 to 90 days after the invoice date. Late fees are assessed on certain receivables once they are 30 days past due. Unbilled receivables represent estimates of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. 
Receivables are stated at the billed or estimated unbilled amount less an allowance for estimated credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is established based on losses expected to occur over the contractual life of the receivable. We estimate an allowance for credit losses on our trade and unbilled receivables by evaluating historical aging and write-off history, adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions, for groups of receivables that share similar economic characteristics. Other receivables are evaluated by reviewing individual accounts, considering aging, financial condition of the debtor, recent payment history and other relevant factors. Account balances are written off in the period they are deemed to be uncollectible.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs for fuel, material and supply inventories of our Electric segment are determined on an average cost basis. Costs for raw material, work in process and finished goods inventories of our Manufacturing and Plastics segments are determined on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis.

Investments
We invest in and hold, through rabbi trusts, corporate-owned life insurance policies to provide future funding for obligations under our supplemental pension plan and a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The polices are recorded at cash surrender value and there are no restrictions on our ability to surrender the policies. 
We hold debt, mutual fund, and money market fund investments either as investments within our captive insurance entity, to provide future funding for obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans or provide a return on our available cash and liquidity. These investments are recorded at fair value. Debt securities are deemed to be available-for-sale securities, accordingly unrealized gains and losses are generally excluded from earnings and recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. We evaluate whether declines in the fair value of debt securities below the cost basis are other-than-temporary. Declines in fair value deemed to be other-than-temporary result in the recognition of unrealized losses, or a portion thereof, in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on mutual and money market funds are recognized in earnings immediately.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Electric plant is stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of additions includes purchased assets, contracted work, direct labor and materials, allocable overheads and allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The amount of interest capitalized to electric plant was $
1.9
 million in 2024, $
1.9
 million in 2023 and $
0.9
 million in 2022. Significant additions or improvements that extend an asset's useful life are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated useful life. For certain asset classes, we employ a group or composite method of depreciation in which certain assets are combined and depreciated over the average life of the combined asset group. Actuarial studies are periodically performed to assess the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our assets, with any changes in these estimates incorporated into depreciation on a prospective basis. Gains or losses on group or composite asset dispositions are recorded to accumulated depreciation and impact current and future depreciation rates. 
Amounts recovered in rates for future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Removal costs, when incurred, are charged against the regulatory liability.    
Property, plant and equipment of our nonelectric operations are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated useful life. The cost of additions includes purchased assets, contracted work, direct labor and materials, allocable overheads and capitalized interest, as applicable. No interest was capitalized in 2024, 2023 or 2022. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Gains or losses on asset dispositions are included in the determination of operating income.

Jointly Owned Facilities
OTP is a joint owner in 
two
 coal-fired steam-powered electric generation plants: Big Stone Plant near Big Stone City, South Dakota and Coyote Station near Beulah, North Dakota. OTP is also a joint owner, with other regional utilities, in several major transmission lines. OTP's interest in each jointly owned facility is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets on a pro-rata basis and OTP's share 
56
Table of Contents
of direct revenue and expenses are included in operating revenues and expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities finances their own investments.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is recognized and initially measured as any excess of the acquisition-date consideration transferred in a business combination over amounts recognized for the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment of goodwill. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We perform our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year and have identified 
three
 reporting units that carry a goodwill balance. We historically tested goodwill for impairment as of December 31st each year; however, in 2024, we elected to change the date of our annual goodwill impairment test to October 1st. We believe this new testing date allows us to better align our annual goodwill impairment testing procedures with our year-end financial reporting, as well as our annual budgeting and forecasting process. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid the recognition of an impairment charge. 
We perform a quantitative impairment assessment, electing to forgo the optional qualitative assessment. The quantitative assessment is a single-step test that identifies both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, with any excess carrying value over the fair value being recognized as an impairment loss.        
Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of customer relationships, are carried at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization. The costs of the intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 
15
 to 
20
 years.
Cloud Computing Costs
We capitalize implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts consistent with capitalized implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the associated contract. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized over periods up to 
ten years
. Capitalized costs and related accumulated amortization are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

1.4

Leases
We recognize a right-of-use lease asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. The length of our lease agreements varies from less than 
one year
 to approximately 
ten years
. We have elected to not record lease assets and liabilities for leases with a lease term at commencement of 12 months or less; such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our leases contain options to renew or extend the lease term at our discretion if certain conditions are met. If a lease contains an option to extend the lease term and there is reasonable certainty the option will be exercised, the option is considered in the lease term at inception, or at such time when an event occurs which triggers the remeasurement of a lease, as applicable. In the determination of the lease term for one of our leased manufacturing facilities, we have incorporated the future lease renewals which we believe are reasonably certain to be exercised in the associated right-of-use asset and liability values.   
We have elected to not separate non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance) from lease components on real estate leases, accordingly the recognized lease asset and lease liability incorporate in their measurement payments for non-lease components. Certain leases include variable lease payments as the amounts are subject to change over the lease term; such amounts are not incorporated into the measurement of the right-of-use lease asset or lease liability. We are unable to determine the interest rate implicit in our leases, thus we apply our incremental borrowing rate to capitalize the right-of-use asset and lease liability. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate by reference to market interest rates on long-term debt, incorporating considerations of the credit quality of the lessee and the term of lease.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived assets including, among other assets, property, plant and equipment, amortizing intangible assets and right-of-use lease assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be 
57
Table of Contents
recoverable. We determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets with the net cash flows expected to be provided by operating activities of the business or related assets. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss would be recognized. Such an impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing the cost of providing benefits and measuring the projected benefit obligation of these plans requires management to make various assumptions and estimates. Certain unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs or credits are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.
We have elected to apply a minimum amortization method for determining the amount of amortization of net cumulative gains or losses to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost for any annual period. Cumulative gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or as a deferred regulatory asset or liability that are in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of pension plan assets are amortized over the expected remaining future service period of active plan participants. In periods in which the cumulative gains and losses do not exceed 10%, no amortization to net period benefit cost is recognized.

Asset Retirement Obligations
Legal obligations related to the future retirement of long-lived assets are recognized as asset retirement obligations (ARO). An ARO is recognized in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated, with an offsetting increase to the associated long-lived asset. AROs are initially recognized at fair value and increased with the passage of time (accretion). ARO estimates are revised periodically with any adjustments reflected in the ARO and associated long-lived asset.

Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are recorded using the tax rates scheduled by tax law to be in effect in the periods when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is determined by taking into consideration forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of the changes.
We recognize the tax effects of all tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of those positions as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the recognition or measurement of such positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period of the changes. We classify interest and penalties on tax uncertainties as components of the provision for income taxes within the consolidated statements of income. 
We have elected to account for transferable tax credits as a component of our income tax provision. We recognize the benefit of PTCs as a reduction of income tax expense in the period the credit is generated, which corresponds to the period the energy production occurs. We apply the deferral method of accounting for ITCs and state wind energy credits. Under this method, ITCs and state wind energy credits are amortized as a reduction to income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the underlying property that gave rise to the credit.
Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company sponsors 
two
 nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of executive officers and other select employees. Each plan allows participants to defer a specified amount or percentage of base wages or incentive compensation into the plan, subject to certain limitations. The Company, at its discretion, may make employer contributions to either plan during any annual period. Participant and employer deferred amounts are segregated into one or more accounts chosen by the participant. Participants earn a return on deferred amounts based on notional investments in the segregated accounts. Participants can elect lump sum distributions or annual installments of deferred balances during the participant's employment or upon retirement.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our liability to participants under these deferred compensation plans was $
29.1
 million and $
24.6
 million. Company contributions to these plans were $
1.3
 million, $
1.2
 million and $
0.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Gains or (losses) recognized due to changes in our payment obligations in connection with these plans amounted to ($
3.3
 million), ($
3.3
 million) and $
3.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation awards are measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable service or performance period. The service period may be limited to the period until such 
58
Table of Contents
time that a recipient is retirement eligible as determined under the award agreement. Awards granted to employees eligible for retirement on the date of grant are expensed in the period of grant. We recognize the effects of award forfeitures as they occur.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and commodity derivative contracts listed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Level 2
 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. 
Level 3
 – Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation and may include complex and subjective models and forecasts.
In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels within the hierarchy, the level in the hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Related Parties
The Otter Tail Corporation Foundation and Otter Tail Power Company Foundation are independent not-for-profit charitable entities affiliated with the Company and are not included in OTC's consolidated financial statements.
 Contribution obligations to the 
two
 foundations totaling $

two
 foundations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
5.5
 million, $
4.3
 million, and $

Variable Interest Entity
In October 2012, the Coyote Station owners, including OTP, entered into an LSA with Coyote Creek Mining Company, LLC (CCMC), a subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, for the purchase of lignite coal to meet the coal supply requirements of Coyote Station for the period beginning in May 2016 and ending in December 2040. The price per ton paid by the Coyote Station owners under the LSA reflects the cost of production, along with an agreed upon profit and capital charge. CCMC was formed for the purpose of mining coal to meet the coal fuel supply requirements of Coyote Station from May 2016 through December 2040 and, based on the terms of the LSA, is considered a variable interest entity (VIE) due to the transfer of all operating and economic risk to the Coyote Station owners, as the agreement is structured so that the price of the coal would cover all costs of operations as well as future reclamation costs. The Coyote Station owners are required to buy certain assets of CCMC at book value should they terminate the contract prior to the end of the contract term and are providing a guarantee of the value of the equity of CCMC because the Coyote Station owners are required to buy the membership interests of CCMC at the end of the contract term at equity value. Under current accounting standards, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements. No single owner of Coyote Station owns a majority interest in Coyote Station and none, individually, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact CCMC. Therefore, none of the owners individually, including OTP, is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company is not required to include CCMC in its consolidated financial statements.
If the LSA terminates prior to the expiration of its term or the production period terminates prior to December 31, 2040 and the Coyote Station owners purchase all of the outstanding membership interests of CCMC, the owners will satisfy or, if permitted by CCMC’s applicable lenders, assume all of CCMC’s obligations owed to CCMC’s lenders under its loans and leases. The Coyote Station owners have limited rights to assign their rights and obligations under the LSA without the consent of CCMC’s lenders during any period in which CCMC’s obligations to its lenders remain outstanding. In the event the contract is terminated prior to the end of the term due to certain events, OTP’s maximum loss exposure, as a result of its involvement with CCMC, could be as high as $
40
 million, or OTP’s 
35
% share of CCMC’s unrecovered costs as of December 31, 2024, if recovery of such a loss is denied by regulatory authorities.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Segment Reporting. 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended authoritative guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, Segment Reporting. The amended guidance expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through expanded disclosures about significant segment expenses. We adopted this updated standard in the 2024 annual period on a retrospective basis, as required by the updated 
59
Table of Contents
standard. The adoption of this updated standard resulted in additional disclosures related to our reportable segments and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Income Taxes. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance codified in ASC 740, Income Taxes. The amended guidance requires additional disaggregated information in effective tax rate reconciliation disclosures and additional disaggregated information about income taxes paid. The updated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in 2025. The amended guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We anticipate adopting the updated standard in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025 and electing to apply the standard on a retrospective basis for all periods presented.
Disaggregated Income Statement Expenses.
 In November 2024, the FASB issued authoritative guidance codified in ASC 220, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income, which will require additional disclosure of certain costs and expenses within the notes to the financial statements. The updated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in 2027 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2028 and can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

Segment Information
Our business is comprised of 
three
 reportable segments, Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics, consistent with our business strategy, organizational structure and our internal reporting and review processes. Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer. Segment net income is the sole measure of segment profit or loss used by our CODM in assessing segment performance and allocating resources to our segments. Our CODM uses segment net income in assessing financial performance on a monthly basis, reviewing and approving annual operating budgets and periodic forecasts, allocating capital or financial resources to our segments, making strategic decisions and measuring returns on equity in comparison to internal thresholds or peer entities. 
The operations of our 
three
 reportable segments are further described below. We have aggregated 
two
 operating segments within our Manufacturing reportable segment based on the similarity between these businesses and their economic characteristics.
Electric
 includes the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota by OTP. In addition, OTP is a participant in the MISO markets. OTP’s operations have been our primary business since 1907.
Manufacturing
 consists of businesses in the following manufacturing activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of plastic thermoformed horticultural containers, life science and industrial packaging, and material handling components. These businesses have manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Illinois and Minnesota and sell products primarily in the United States.
Plastics
 consists of businesses producing PVC pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The PVC pipe is sold primarily in the western half of the United States and Canada.

Reconciliation to Consolidated Amounts
Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate operating costs include items such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of our captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance. Corporate is not an operating segment, rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to consolidated amounts.

Concentrations
Our Plastics segment businesses use PVC resin as a critical component within their PVC pipe manufacturing process. There are a limited number of PVC resin suppliers in the U.S., and in 2024 we sourced all of our PVC resin needs from four vendors. Although there are a limited number of PVC resin suppliers, we believe that other suppliers could provide PVC resin on comparable terms. Additionally, most U.S. resin production plants are located in the Gulf Coast region. These plants are subject to the risk of damage and production shutdowns because of exposure to hurricanes or other extreme weather events that occur in this region. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin could cause production delays, a possible loss of sales or result in increased costs to secure resin, all of which would adversely affect our operating results.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, two customers combined accounted for 
19
% of Electric segment operating revenues, two customers combined to account for 
36
% of Manufacturing segment operating revenues and two customers combined to account for 
52
% of Plastics segment operating revenues, with one of those customers providing 
11
% of our consolidated operating revenues. 
Entity-Wide Information
All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States and substantially all of our operating revenues are from customers located within the United States.

1
Costs subject to recovery without a rate of return.
2
Amount eligible for recovery includes an incentive or rate of return.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
 represent benefit costs and actuarial losses and gains subject to recovery or refund through rates as they are expensed or amortized. These unrecognized benefit costs and actuarial losses and gains are eligible for treatment as regulatory assets or liabilities based on their probable inclusion in future electric rates.
Alternative Revenue Program Riders
 regulatory assets and liabilities are revenues not yet collected from customers or amounts collected from customers that are subject to refund, respectively, primarily due to investments in qualifying transmission, conservation, renewable resource, environmental and other generation assets, and the impact of decoupling.
Deferred Income Taxes
 primarily represent the revaluation of accumulated deferred income taxes arising from the change in the federal income tax rate in 2017. This amount is being refunded to customers over the estimated lives of the property assets from which the deferred income taxes originated.   
Fuel Clause Adjustments
 represent the under- or over-collection of fuel costs relative to the estimated cost of fuel included in customer rates, which will be collected from or returned to customers in future periods.
Derivative Instruments
 represent unrealized losses recognized on derivative instruments. On final settlement of such instruments, any realized losses are recovered from customers.
Plant Removal Obligations
 represent amounts collected from customers to be used to cover actual removal costs as incurred.
North Dakota PTC Refunds
 represent PTCs earned from our wind energy facilities. These amounts are being allocated to customers over the lives of the assets generating the credits.
Other
 regulatory assets and liabilities include other amounts that we expect to recover from, or return to, customers in future periods, such as the cost of abandoned projects, costs incurred in connection with recent rate cases and other items.
North Dakota Rate Case 
On November 2, 2023, OTP filed a request with the NDPSC for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in North Dakota. In its filing, OTP requested a net increase in annual revenue of $
17.4
 million, or 
8.4
%, based on an allowed rate of return on rate base of 
7.85
% and an allowed rate of ROE of 
10.6
% on an equity ratio of 
53.5
% of total capital. The filing also included an interim rate request of a net increase in annual revenue of $
12.4
 million, or 
6.0
%, which was approved by the NDPSC on December 13, 2023. Interim rates went into effect on January 1, 2024. On July 3, 2024, OTP filed an update to the original request increasing the amount of the net annual revenue requirement from $
17.4
 million to $
22.5
 million, or a net increase of 
10.9
% in annual revenue, to account for certain items identified throughout the regulatory process. 
On December 30, 2024, the NDPSC approved a settlement agreement between OTP and certain interested parties in the general rate case and issued its written order on final rates. The key provisions of the order include a revenue requirement of $
225.6
 million, based on a return on rate base of 
7.53
%, and an allowed ROE of 
10.10
% on an equity ratio of 
53.5
%. The net annual revenue requirement includes a net increase of $
13.1
 million, or 
6.18
%. OTP’s revenue requirement was reduced by approximately 
65
Table of Contents
$
3.0
 million primarily due to the inclusion of forecasted PTCs plus adjustments for new customer load additions, which were not included in OTP’s updated request filed on July 3, 2024. Through the settlement of the case, the parties also agreed to establish an earnings sharing mechanism, whereby 
70
% of actual earnings in excess of a 
10.20
% ROE would be returned to customers, with OTP retaining the remaining 
30
%.

On December 11, 2024, OTC entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the OTC Credit Agreement) and OTP entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the OTP Credit Agreement), in each case amending and restating the previously existing credit agreements, to extend the maturity date of each credit facility and adjust the maximum debt to total capitalization covenant. The OTP Credit Agreement was also amended to increase the maximum borrowing capacity. The OTC agreement provides for a $
170.0
 million unsecured revolving line of credit and the OTP agreement provides for a $
220.0
 million unsecured revolving line of credit to support operations, fund capital expenditures, refinance certain indebtedness and provide for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $
40.0
 million under the OTC Credit Agreement and $
50.0
 million under the OTP Credit Agreement. Each credit facility includes an accordion provision allowing the borrower to increase the borrowing capacity under the facility, subject to certain conditions, up to $
290.0
 million and $
300.0
 million under the OTC Credit Agreement and OTP Credit Agreement, respectively.  
Borrowings under each credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest on outstanding balances and a commitment fee is charged based on the average unused amount available to be drawn under the respective facility. The variable rate of interest to be charged is based on a benchmark interest rate, either SOFR or a Base Rate, as defined in the credit agreements, selected by the borrower at the time of an advance, subject to the conditions of each agreement, plus an applicable credit spread. The credit spread ranges from 
zero
 to 
2.00
%, depending on the benchmark interest rate selected, and is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of the relevant borrower. The weighted-average interest rate on all outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 
5.61
% and 
6.70
%.
Each credit facility contains a number of restrictions on the borrower, including restrictions on the ability to merge, sell assets, make investments, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party and engage in transactions with related parties. The agreements also require the borrower to maintain various financial covenants, as further described below. Each credit facility includes a cross-default provision whereby an event of default of other outstanding indebtedness will trigger an event of default under the agreement. Each credit facility expires on December 11, 2029.

On March 28, 2024, OTP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which OTP issued, in a private placement transaction, $
120.0
 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of (a) $
60.0
 million of 
5.48
% Series 2024A Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2034, and (b) $
60.0
 million of 
5.77
% Series 2024B Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2054.
Per the terms of the agreement, OTP may prepay all or any part of the notes (in an amount not less than 
10
% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment) at 
100
% of the principal amount so prepaid, together with unpaid accrued interest and a make-whole amount, as defined in the agreement; provided that no default or event of default exists under the agreement. Any prepayment of the Series 2024A Notes then outstanding on or after January 1, 2034, or the Series 2024B Notes then outstanding on or after October 1, 2053, will be made without any make-whole amount. Consistent with other of our borrowings, the agreement contains a number of restrictions on the business of OTP, including restrictions on OTP’s ability to merge, sell substantially all assets, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
Our guaranteed and unsecured notes require the borrower to maintain various financial covenants, as further described below. These notes provide for prepayment options allowing for a full or partial prepayment at 
100
% of the principal amount so prepaid, together with unpaid accrued interest and a make-whole amount, as defined. These notes also include restrictions on the borrower, including its ability to merge, sell assets, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party and engage in transactions with related parties. The notes include a cross-default provision whereby an event of default of other outstanding indebtedness will trigger an event of default under the note.

Financial Covenants
Certain of OTC's and OTP's short-term and long-term debt agreements require the borrower, whether OTC or OTP, to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum debt to total capitalization of either 
0.60
 to 1.00 or 
0.65
 to 1.00, depending on the debt agreement, a minimum interest and dividend coverage ratio of 
1.50
 to 1.00, and a maximum level of priority indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2024, OTC and OTP were in compliance with these financial covenants.

Employee Postretirement Benefits
Pension Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors a noncontributory funded pension plan (the Pension Plan), an unfunded, nonqualified Executive Survivor and Supplemental Retirement Plan (ESSRP), both accounted for as defined benefit pension plans, and a postretirement healthcare plan accounted for as an other postretirement benefit plan.
The Pension Plan, which previously covered substantially all corporate and OTP employees, was closed to new employees in 2013. The plan provides retirement compensation to all covered employees at age 
65
, with reduced compensation in cases of retirement prior to age 
62
. Participants are fully vested after completing 
five years
 of vesting service. The plan assets consist of equity funds, fixed income funds, cash and cash equivalents and alternative investments. None of the plan assets are invested in common stock or debt securities of the Company.
The ESSRP, an unfunded plan, provides for defined benefit payments to executive officers and certain key management employees on their retirement for life, or to their beneficiaries on their death. The ESSRP was amended and restated in 2019 to i) freeze the participation in the restoration retirement benefit component of the plan and ii) freeze benefit accruals under the restoration retirement benefit component of the plan for all participants of the plan except any participants deemed to be grandfathered participants. 
The postretirement healthcare plan, closed to new participants in 2010, provides a portion of health insurance benefits for retired and covered corporate and OTP employees. To be eligible for retiree health insurance benefits, the employee must be 
55
 years of age with a minimum of 
10
 years of service. The plan is an unfunded plan and accordingly holds no plan assets.
Pension Plan Assets. 
We have established a Retirement Plans Administration Committee to develop and monitor our investment strategy for our Pension Plan assets. Our investment strategy includes the following objectives:
•
The assets of the plan will be invested in accordance with all applicable laws in a manner consistent with fiduciary standards including Employee Retirement Income Security Act standards of 1974 (ERISA) (if applicable). Specifically:
◦
The safeguards and diversity that a prudent investor would adhere to must be present in the investment program.
◦
All transactions undertaken on behalf of the Pension Plan must be in the best interest of plan participants and their beneficiaries.
•
The primary objective is to provide a source of retirement income for its participants and beneficiaries.
•
The near-term primary financial objective is to improve and protect the funded status of the plan.
•
A secondary financial objective is to minimize pension funding and expense volatility where possible. 

We have developed an asset allocation target, measured at investment market value, to provide guideline percentages of investment mix. This investment mix is intended to achieve the financial objectives of the plan. The permitted range is a guide and will at times not reflect the actual asset allocation due to market conditions, actions of our investment managers and required cash flows to and from the Pension Plan. 
The following table presents our target asset allocation permitted range along with the actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Return Enhancement
 investments are those that seek to provide equity-like, long-term capital appreciation. Examples include equity securities, including dynamic asset allocation funds, and higher yielding fixed income securities, such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt.
Risk Management
 investments seek to decrease downside risk or act as a hedge against plan liabilities. Examples are cash and fixed income instruments.
71
Table of Contents
Alternative
 investments seek to either provide return enhancement through long-term appreciation or risk management through decreased downside risk. The defining characteristic of these asset types is uncorrelated source of returns, less liquidity and private market access. Examples include investments in the SEI Energy Debt Collective Fund.

The investments held by the SEI Energy Debt Collective Fund on December 31, 2024 and 2023 consist mainly of below investment grade high yield bonds and loans of U.S. energy companies which trade at a discount to fair value. Redemptions are allowed semi-annually with a 
95
-day notice period, subject to fund director consent and certain gate, holdback and suspension restrictions. Subscriptions are allowed monthly with a 
three-year
 lock up on subscriptions. The fund’s assets are valued in accordance with valuations reported by the fund’s sub-advisor or the fund’s underlying investments or other independent third-party sources, although SEI, in its discretion, may use other valuation methods, subject to compliance with ERISA, as applicable. On an annual basis, as determined by the investment manager in its sole discretion, an independent valuation agent is retained to provide a valuation of the illiquid assets of the fund and of any other asset of the fund.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost. 
A portion of service

cost may be capitalized as a cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment. When recognized in the consolidated statements of income, service cost is recognized within one of the components of operating expenses. Nonservice cost components of net periodic benefit cost may be deferred and recognized as a regulatory asset under the accounting guidance for regulated operations. When recognized in the consolidated statements of income, nonservice cost components are recognized as nonservice cost components of postretirement benefits.
The following table lists the components of net periodic benefit cost of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

We develop our estimated discount rate through the use of a hypothetical bond portfolio method. This method derives the discount rate from the average yield of a collection of high credit quality bonds which produce cash flows similar to our anticipated future benefit payments. We estimate the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets based primarily on asset category studies using historical market return and volatility data with forward-looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts of capital markets. Modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically.

Asset Retirement Obligations
We have recognized asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to our coal-fired generation plants, natural gas combustion turbines, solar facility and wind turbines. The cost of AROs include items such as site restoration, closure or removal of ash pits and removal of certain structures, generators, asbestos and storage tanks. We have other legal obligations associated with the retirement of a variety of other long-lived tangible assets used in electric operations where the estimated settlement costs are individually and collectively immaterial. We have 
no
 assets legally restricted for the settlement of any AROs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
0.1
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, was included in other current liabilities and $
42.1

Coal Combustion Residual Regulations
In May 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule amending coal combustion residual (CCR) regulations. The final rule introduces new requirements for the management of coal ash at active coal-fired power plants and inactive coal-fired 
75
Table of Contents
power plants with a legacy surface impoundment. The regulations impose new requirements including groundwater monitoring, closure standards, post-closure care obligations and potential remediation activities. At this time, we do not believe there are any significant new requirements which are applicable to our coal-fired power plants, except for Big Stone Plant. During the fourth quarter of 2024, a site evaluation was performed at Big Stone Plant to assess the presence and estimated volumes of coal ash stored at the facility. Based on this and our assessment of the regulations, we believe the plant will be impacted by the new requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we recognized $
3.0
 million of additional liabilities for new obligations resulting from the EPA's final CCR rule for costs associated with coal ash removal and groundwater monitoring we expect to incur in the future. The final rule requires facility evaluations to be performed in the future. Revisions to our estimated compliance costs or further obligations could be identified through the process of performing the additional evaluations. Should such revisions be necessary or if additional cost obligations are identified, we will update our cash flow estimates and resulting retirement obligation at that time.

Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
Electric Utility Capacity and Energy Requirements. 
OTP has commitments for the purchase of capacity and energy requirements under contractual agreements, including wind power purchase agreements extending into 2048. Generally, the terms of OTP's wind power purchase agreements require OTP to purchase all of the electricity generated by a particular wind farm, but do not include fixed or minimum payments. The required payments are variable and the amounts due are determined based upon the amount of capacity available or electricity generated. Capacity and energy requirement costs under these agreements totaled $
6.0
 million, $
5.6
 million and $
13.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  
Coal Purchase Commitments. 
OTP has contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of its coal requirements. OTP’s current coal purchase agreement with CCMC for Coyote Station expires on December 31, 2040. All of Coyote Station’s coal requirements for the period covered must be purchased under this agreement. The agreement is structured so that the price of the coal covers all of CCMC's operating, financing and future mine reclamation costs. In the table below, we have estimated the future payments to be made under the terms of the agreement until its maturity. OTP has an agreement for the purchase of Big Stone Plant’s coal requirements through December 31, 2026. There is no fixed minimum purchase requirement, and no amounts for this agreement have been included in the table below; however, under this agreement all of Big Stone Plant’s coal requirements for the period 
77

covered must be purchased under this agreement. Coal purchase costs under these 
two
 agreements totaled $
44.7
 million, $
43.7
 million and $
45.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  
Land Easement Payments. 
OTP has commitments to make payments for land easements not classified as leases. The contractual terms of these easements are generally 
99
 years or do not have a stated maturity date; however, per the terms of the agreements, our requirement to make payment ends once we cease use of the land. As such, in the table below, we have included payments under these easements through the estimated useful lives of the facilities associated with the easement. The commitments under these arrangements extend into 2055 and total approximately $
62.0
 million. Land easement costs under these agreements totaled $
1.8
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
1.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Other Commitments. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had commitments under contracts for plant maintenance, software subscriptions and other services extending into 2046 which totaled approximately $
10.6
 million.

Solar Development. 
On October 30, 2024, OTP entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of a solar facility currently under development. The assets to be acquired include real property rights and interests, interconnection agreements, state and local permits, and other development assets. Per the agreement, the purchase price is equal to $
23.6
 million, plus the reimbursement of certain interconnection costs and costs to purchase and store the main power transformer. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in late 2025 or early 2026, and remains subject to certain conditions to close, including regulatory and other approvals. OTP would be subject to a termination fee of up to $
5.0
 million if the seller has satisfied all required conditions to close but the transaction is not consummated.  
Contingencies
FERC ROE.
 In November 2013 and February 2015, customers filed complaints with FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO tariff rate. FERC issued an order on November 19, 2020, which adopted a revised ROE methodology and set the base ROE at 10.02% (10.52% with an adder) effective for the fifteen-month period from November 2013 to February 2015 and on a prospective basis beginning in September 2016. The order also dismissed any complaints covering the period from February 2015 to May 2016. On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the FERC order citing a lack of reasoned explanation by FERC in its adoption of its revised ROE methodology as outlined in its November 2020 order and remanded the matter to FERC to reopen the proceedings. 
On October 17, 2024, FERC issued an Order on Remand modifying its ROE methodology and establishing a base ROE of 9.98% (10.48% with an adder) effective for the fifteen-month period from November 2013 to February 2015 and on a prospective basis beginning in September 2016, and required MISO transmission owners to provide refunds to customers for collections in excess of the base ROE of 9.98% for the applicable period, plus interest. In addition, FERC concluded the evidentiary record continues to support the ROE established for the period from February 2015 to May 2016.
Prior to FERC's Order on Remand, we had deferred recognition of certain revenues and recognized a refund liability which reflected the amount previously collected under the MISO tariff rate that we anticipated would be refunded to customers. Our previous estimated refund amount was larger than the actual amount ordered by FERC in the Order on Remand and was therefore reduced, which resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $
2.5
 million recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. The balance of the recorded refund liability as of December 31, 2024 was $
0.5
 million.

Self-Funding of Transmission Upgrades for Generator Interconnections. 
FERC

has granted transmission owners within MISO and other regional transmission organizations (RTOs) the unilateral authority to determine the funding mechanism for interconnection transmission upgrades that are necessary to accommodate new generation facilities connecting to the electrical grid. Under existing FERC orders, transmission owners can unilaterally determine whether the generator pays the transmission owner in advance for the transmission upgrade or, alternatively, the transmission owner can elect to fund the upgrade and recover over time from the generator the cost of and a return on the upgrade investment (a self-funding). FERC’s orders granting transmission owners this unilateral funding authority have been judicially contested on the basis that transmission owners may be motivated to discriminate among generators in making funding determinations. In the most recent judicial proceedings, the petitioners argued to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that FERC did not comply with a previous judicial order to fully develop a record regarding the risk of discrimination and the financial risk absorbed by transmission owners for generator-funded upgrades. In December 2022, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the petitioners remanding the matter to FERC, instructing the agency to adequately explain the basis of its orders. The Court of Appeals decision did not vacate transmission owners’ unilateral funding authority. 
In June 2024, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause proceeding against 
four
 RTOs, including MISO. Within its order, FERC indicates that the transmission tariffs of the RTOs appear to be unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential because they allow transmission owners to unilaterally elect transmission owner self-funding, which may increase costs, impose barriers to transmission interconnection and result in undue discrimination among interconnection customers.
The order required each RTO to submit filings to either 1) show cause as to why the transmission tariff remains just and reasonable and not duly discriminatory or preferential, or 2) to explain what changes to the tariff it believes would remedy the identified concerns. FERC has received a number of responses to its Order to Show Cause. In September 2024, in separate filings, MISO and transmission owners within MISO, including OTP, filed responses outlining the reasons why the self-funding option remains just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Other responses have been provided by other RTOs, individual transmission owners, developers of renewable generation facilities and other interested parties. 
OTP, as a transmission owner in MISO, has exercised its authority and elected to self-fund previous transmission upgrades necessary to accommodate new system generation. Under such an election, OTP is recovering the cost of the transmission upgrade and a return on that investment from the generator over a contractual period of time. Should the resolution of this matter eliminate transmission owners’ unilateral funding authority on either a prospective or retrospective basis, our financial results would be impacted. We cannot at this time reasonably predict the outcome of this matter given the uncertainty as to how FERC may ultimately decide on the matter after RTOs' filings in response to the Order to Show Cause.
Class Action Lawsuits.
 Several class action complaints against certain PVC pipe manufacturers, including OTC, have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of antitrust laws. The first of the complaints was filed on August 23, 2024. The various complaints have been consolidated under the caption In re: PVC Pipe Antitrust Litigation (Case No. 1:24-cv-07639). Specifically, the complaints allege, among other things, that beginning in at least January 2021, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of PVC municipal water and electrical conduit pipe in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.
In addition, on August 27, 2024, the Company received a grand jury subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division. The subpoena calls for production of documents regarding the manufacturing, selling and pricing of PVC pipe. The Company is responding to the subpoena and intends to comply with its obligations under the subpoena.   
At this time, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, arising from the class action complaints or the DOJ investigation. However, if an antitrust violation by the Company is found, it could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, operating results and liquidity. The Company believes that there are factual and legal defenses to the allegations in the complaints and intends to defend itself accordingly.
Other Contingencies. 
We are party to litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business. We regularly analyze relevant information and, as necessary, estimate and record accrued liabilities for legal, regulatory enforcement and other matters in which a loss is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. We believe the effect on our consolidated operating results, financial position and cash flows, if any, for the disposition of all matters pending as of December 31, 2024, other than those discussed above, will not be material.

Stockholders' Equity
Capital Structure
In addition to authorized and outstanding common stock, the Company has 
1,500,000
 authorized no par value cumulative preferred shares and 
1,000,000
 authorized no par value cumulative preference shares. 
No
 cumulative preferred or cumulative preference shares were outstanding at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Registration Statements
On May 3, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which we may offer for sale, from time to time, either separately or together in any combination, equity, debt or other securities described in the shelf registration statement. The registration statement expires in May 2027. No shares were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement in 2024.
On May 3, 2024, we filed a second registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to 
1,500,000
 common shares under an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, which provides shareholders, retail customers of OTP and other interested investors methods of purchasing our common shares by reinvesting their dividends or making optional cash investments. Shares purchased under the plan may be new issue common shares or common shares purchased on the open market. In 2024, we issued 
70,469
 common shares under this program and no proceeds were received, as all shares issued were purchased on the open market. As of December 31, 2024, 
1,429,531
 shares remained available for purchase or issuance under the plan. The registration statement expires in May 2027.
Dividend Restrictions
OTC is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payments of dividends to our shareholders is from intercompany distributions made by OTC's subsidiaries to OTC. 
As a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements, restrictions could occur on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by OTC's subsidiaries, as further described below: 
Both the OTC Credit Agreement and OTP Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends upon a default or event of default, including failure to maintain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
Under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. What constitutes “funds properly included in a capital account” is undefined in the Federal Power Act and the related regulations; however, the FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as i) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, ii) the dividend is not excessive and iii) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials.
The MPUC indirectly limits the amount of dividends OTP can pay to OTC by requiring an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 
47.2
% and 
57.7
%, with total capitalization not to exceed $
2.2
 billion based on OTP’s capital structure requirements as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, OTP’s equity-to-total-capitalization ratio including short-term debt was 
53.1
% and its net assets restricted from distribution totaled approximately $
834.5
 million.

Share-Based Payments
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes the issuance of 
1,400,000
 common shares, allowing eligible employees to purchase our common shares through payroll withholding at a discount of up to 
15
% off the market price at the end of each 
six-month
 purchase period. Employee withholding amounts may not be less than $
10
 or more than $
2,000
 per month, subject to certain limitations, as described in the plan. A plan participant may cease making payroll deductions at any time. A participant may not purchase more than 
2,000
 shares in a given 
six-month
 purchase period under the plan and may not purchase more than $
25,000
 (fair market value) of common shares under the plan and all other purchase plans (if any) in a calendar year. A participant may withdraw from the plan at any time and elect to receive the balance of their contributions to the plan that have not yet been used to purchase shares. Shares purchased under the plan are automatically enrolled in the Company's dividend reinvestment plan. Shares purchased under the plan may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed, except for certain situations allowed by the plan, such as upon death, for a period of 
18
 months after purchase. At our discretion, shares purchased under the plan can be either new issue shares or shares purchased in the open market. The plan shall automatically terminate when all of the shares authorized under the plan have been issued. 
We recognize the 
15
% discount to the fair market value of the purchased shares as stock-based compensation expense, which amounted to $
0.4
 million, $
0.3
 million and $
0.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of shares issued under the plan amounted to 
31,252
, 
26,348
 and 
26,420
 shares. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
206,115
 shares available for purchase under the plan. 
Share-Based Compensation Plan
The 2023 Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by our shareholders in April 2023, authorizes the issuance of 
979,891
 common shares, including 
500,000
 newly requested common shares, for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted 
81
Table of Contents
stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other stock-based awards. In addition, common shares subject to any outstanding awards under our prior stock incentive plans that are forfeited, canceled or reacquired by the Company will become available for re-issuance under the 2023 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
828,761
 shares were available for issuance under the plan. The plan terminates on April 17, 2033.
We grant restricted stock awards to our employees and members of our Board of Directors and stock performance awards to our executive officers and certain other key employees as part of our long-term compensation and retention program. Stock-based compensation cost, recognized within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income, amounted to $
9.1
 million, $
7.4
 million and $
6.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The related income tax benefit recognized for these periods amounted to $
2.7
 million, $
1.6
 million and $
1.7
 million. 
Restricted Stock Awards. 
Restricted stock awards are granted to executive officers and other key employees and members of the Company's Board of Directors. The awards vest, depending on award recipient, either ratably over a period of 
three
 to 
four years
 or cliff vest after 
four years
. Vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, including upon retirement. Awards granted to members of the Board of Directors are issued and outstanding upon grant and carry the same voting and dividend rights of unrestricted outstanding common stock. Awards granted to executive officers are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period, subject to forfeiture under the terms of the agreement, but such awards are not issued or outstanding upon grant and do not provide for voting rights.
The grant-date fair value of each restricted stock award is determined based on the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant adjusted to exclude the value of dividends for those awards that do not receive dividend or dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period.

3.7
 million of unrecognized compensation cost for unvested restricted stock awards to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.5
 years.
Stock Performance Awards. 
Stock performance awards are granted to executive officers and certain other key employees. The awards vest at the end of a 
three-year
 performance period. The number of common shares awarded, if any, at the end of the performance period ranges from 
zero
 to 
150
% of the target amount based on 
two
 performance measures i) total shareholder return relative to a peer group (TSR component) and ii) return on equity (ROE component). The awards have no voting or dividend rights during the vesting period. Vesting of the awards is accelerated in certain circumstances, including upon retirement. The number of common shares awarded on an accelerated vesting is based on actual performance at the end of the performance period.
The grant-date fair value of the ROE component of the stock performance awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was determined using the grant date stock price and a discounted cash flow analysis to adjust for expected unearned dividends during the vesting period. 
The grant-date fair value of the TSR component of the stock performance awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was determined using a Monte Carlo fair value simulation model incorporating the following assumptions:

five-year
 period. Dividend yield was estimated based on historic and future yield estimates.

Earnings Per Share
The numerator used in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share is net income. The denominator used in the calculation of basic earnings per share is the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. The denominator used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share is derived by adjusting basic shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of potential shares outstanding, which consist of shares associated with time- and performance-based stock awards and our employee stock purchase plan.
The following includes the computation of the denominator for basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Derivative Instruments
OTP enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to future commodity price variability, specifically future wholesale energy and natural gas prices, and reduce volatility in prices for our retail electric customers. These derivative instruments are not designated as qualifying hedging transactions but provide for an economic hedge against future price variability. The instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis with assets and liabilities presented separately. In 
83
Table of Contents
accordance with rate-making and cost recovery processes, we recognize a regulatory asset or liability to defer losses or gains from derivative activity until settlement of the associated derivative instrument. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, OTP had multiple outstanding pay-fixed, receive-variable swap agreements. The contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024 had various settlement dates throughout 2025.

Level 1 fair value measurements are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.

Table of Contents
The level 2 fair value measurements for government and corporate debt securities are determined based on valuations provided by third parties which utilize industry accepted valuation models and observable market inputs to determine valuation. Some valuations or model inputs used by the pricing services may be based on broker quotes.
The level 2 fair value measurements for derivative instruments are determined by using inputs such as forward electric commodity prices, adjusted for location differences. These inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. 
In addition to assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we also hold financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets but for which disclosure of the fair value of these financial instruments is provided. 
The following reflects the carrying value and estimated fair value of these assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that fair value:
Cash Equivalents: 
The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. Fair value is determined based on quoted prices in active markets, a Level 1 fair value input.
Short-Term Debt: 
The carrying amount approximates fair value because the debt obligations are short-term in nature and balances outstanding are subject to variable rates of interest which reset frequently, a Level 2 fair value input.
Long-Term Debt: 
The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on current market indications for borrowings of similar maturities with similar terms, a Level 2 fair value input.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosures Controls and Procedures
.
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report.
