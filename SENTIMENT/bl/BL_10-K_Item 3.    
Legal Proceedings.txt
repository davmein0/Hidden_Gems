Item 3.    
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, including claims, litigation, investigations, and inquiries arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, we are not a party to any litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market for Our Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters
Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “BL”.
Holders of Record
At February 14, 2025, there were 3 stockholders of record. The number of record holders does not include beneficial holders who hold their shares in “street name,” meaning that the shares are held for their accounts by a broker or other nominee. Accordingly, we believe that the total number of beneficial holders is higher than the number of our stockholders of record.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, primarily to finance our operations and effect share repurchases and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our Board may deem relevant.
Stock Price Performance Graph
This performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
The following graph compares (i) the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with (ii) the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and (iii) the cumulative total return of the S&P Software & Services Select Industry Index (SPSISS), all over the period from December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2024, assuming the investment of $100 in our common stock and in both of the other indices on December 31, 2019 and the reinvestment of dividends. The graph uses the closing market price on December 31, 2019 of $51.56 per share as the initial value of our common stock. As discussed above, we have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring or paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On November 17, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. The authorization will expire at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market repurchases or through privately-negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock, and it may be suspended at any time in our discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have not repurchased any shares under the repurchase program.

Overview
We provide a unified, scalable, and flexible platform tailored to the evolving needs of the Office of the CFO and deliver purpose-built applications that address critical processes, including financial close & consolidation, intercompany accounting, and invoice-to-cash. Our software and services provide the critical technology and industry-leading practices that deliver accurate, efficient, and intelligent financial operations. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems.
At December 31, 2024, we had 397,477 individual users across 4,443 customers. Additionally, we continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers, and resellers.
Our cloud-based applications, increasingly powered by our BlackLine Studio360 Platform, include Account Reconciliations, Transaction Matching, Task Management, Financial Reporting Analytics, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Compliance, Smart Close for SAP, Cash Application, Credit & Risk Management, Collections Management, Disputes & Deductions Management, Team & Task Management, AR Intelligence, Electronic Invoicing & Payments, Intercompany Create, Intercompany Balance & Resolve, and Intercompany Net & Settle. These applications address many use cases across our customers’ financial operations and include comprehensive and flexible solutions that deliver best practices for end-to-end record-to-report and invoice-to-cash processes. 
We derived approximately 95% of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform and approximately 5% from professional services for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our subscription contracts have initial non-cancellable terms of one year to three years with renewal options. The majority of new contracts in 2024 and 2023 had an initial term of three years. We price our subscriptions based on a number of factors, primarily the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. We typically invoice customers annually in advance for subscriptions, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal.
Professional services consist primarily of implementation and consulting services. With the exception of our intercompany accounting solutions acquired as part of our acquisition of FourQ, our product offerings are available for immediate use on our platform after granting access to a new customer. We typically help customers implement our solutions, and we also provide consulting services to help customers optimize the use of our products. We invoice customers for our consulting services on a time-and-materials basis and recognize that revenue as services are performed. A limited number of our customers are provided professional services for a fixed fee which we invoice in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional-performance basis as the services are rendered.
We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, our solution integrates with SAP’s ERP solutions, and SAP is part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions as SolEx, for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. We also have an agreement with Google Cloud in which we collaborate with them on joint selling and go-to-market activities and bring enhanced automation solutions for finance and accounting to new and existing customers.
Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of customers to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our sales and customer success teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating customers on the value all our products provide.
The length of our sales cycle depends on the size of a potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-size customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Financial Management. As we continue to focus on 
41
increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in our results for any particular period.
We have historically signed a high percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month of the quarter. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into during the fourth quarter or last month of any quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is nominal due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we had revenues totaling $653.3 million, $590.0 million, and $522.9 million, respectively. We generated net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc. of $161.2 million and $52.8 million and incurred a net loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. of $29.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Global Macroeconomic Factors
Our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. General macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession, inflation or rising interest rates, an economic downturn in the U.S. or internationally, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns, or bank failures or instability in the financial services sector, has and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. As a result of economic uncertainty, we have seen customers delay and defer purchasing decisions, which has adversely impacted our near-term demand. 
Acquisition of Data Interconnect
On September 12, 2023, we completed the DI Acquisition for cash consideration of $11.4 million, which was paid at the closing of the acquisition. The DI Acquisition enhances our existing accounts receivable automation solution capabilities through EIPP. Transaction-related costs, which include, but are not limited to, accounting, legal, and advisory fees related to the transaction, totaled approximately $1.2 million and were expensed as incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023.
BlackLine accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date and the purchase price allocation was final.
Acquisition of FourQ
On January 26, 2022, we completed the FourQ Acquisition and paid cash consideration of $160.2 million upon closing of the acquisition. In addition, we agreed to pay a maximum of $73.2 million of contingent consideration if certain earnout conditions were met. At December 31, 2024, the related liability for the FourQ Acquisition was zero. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and we are no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of $73.2 million. 
Restructuring Costs
Fiscal 2023 Restructuring Program 
On August 23, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to support our growth, scale, and profitability objectives. As part of the restructuring, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 9.0%, or 166 total employee positions. Restructuring costs related to the August 2023 restructuring consisted of one-time termination benefits. Refer to “Note 12 - Restructuring Costs” for additional information.
Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Program

On December 7, 2022, we announced our decision to commit to a restructuring plan that was designed to focus on key growth priorities. Restructuring costs related to the December 2022 restructuring consisted of one-time termination benefits. Refer to “Note 12 - Restructuring Costs” for additional information.
Key Metrics
We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.

Dollar-based net revenue retention rate. 
We believe that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and grow our relationships with existing customers over time. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention rate as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. We define implied monthly subscription and support revenue as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of our customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. At December 31, 2024, our dollar-based net revenue retention rate declined from the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates, higher attrition, and a more moderate rate of acquiring customer accounts. Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our customer success and sales teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value our products provide.
Number of customers. 
We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business. We define a customer as a company that contributes to our subscription and support revenue as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without

any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.
Number of users. 
Since our customers generally pay fees based on the number of users on our platform within their organization, we believe the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of our business. While the fees for the majority of the products we sell are user-based, we are seeing an increasing volume of transactions for our non-user based strategic products, such as eInvoicing & Payments, Transaction Matching, Intercompany, and BlackLine Cash Application.
Key Components of our Results of Operations
Revenues
Subscription and support.
 Our subscription contracts have initial non-cancellable terms of one year to three years with renewal options. The majority of new contracts in 2024 and 2023 had an initial term of three years. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed to by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. At any time during the subscription period, customers may increase their number of users and add products. Additional fees are payable for the remainder of the initial or renewed contract term. Customers may only reduce their number of users or subscription to products upon renewal of their arrangement. Revenues from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform composed approximately 95% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with sales of on-premise software licenses and related support, but we no longer develop any new applications or functionality for our legacy on-premise software, and anticipate that this component of our revenues will continue to decline relative to total revenue.
Professional services.
 We offer our customers implementation and consulting services. With the exception of our intercompany accounting solutions acquired from the FourQ Acquisition, our product offerings are available for immediate use on our platform after granting access to a new customer. We typically help customers implement our solutions, and we also provide consulting and training services to help customers optimize the use of our products. 
43
These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. We apply the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when we have the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. A limited number of our customers are provided professional services for a fixed fee, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional-performance basis as the services are rendered. Professional services revenues composed approximately 5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.
For a description of our revenue accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates.”
Cost of Revenues 
Subscription and support cost of revenues.
 Subscription and support cost of revenues primarily consist of amortization of acquired developed technology costs, salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation associated with our hosting operations and support personnel, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, cloud hosting costs, and data center costs related to hosting our cloud-based software. We also allocate a portion of overhead to subscription and support cost of revenues.
Professional services costs of revenues.
 Costs associated with providing professional services primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our implementation personnel. These costs are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. We also allocate a portion of overhead to professional services cost of revenues.
Operating Expenses
Sales and marketing.
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, including stock-based compensation of sales and marketing personnel and related sales support teams, sales and partner commissions, marketing events, advertising costs, computer software-related costs, travel, trade shows, other marketing materials, transaction-related costs, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets and impairment of cloud computing implementation costs. We defer sales and partner commissions and amortize them over an estimated period of benefit of five years. We expect a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2025 as we leverage efficiencies in sales support and further improve productivity.
Research and development.
 Research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel, and transaction-related costs. Research and development expenses also include third-party contractors and supplies, computer software-related costs and allocated overhead. Other than software development costs that qualify for capitalization, as discussed above, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs to remain consistent in 2025 as we execute our product roadmap and invest in strategic initiatives, including AI.
General and administrative.
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional fees, other corporate-related expenses and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of trade name intangible assets, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, and impairment of cloud computing implementation costs. We expect general and administrative costs to remain consistent in 2025, with targeted investments in corporate IT to support innovation and automation initiatives.
Restructuring costs
. Restructuring costs consist of one-time termination benefits. Refer to “Note 12 - Restructuring Costs” for additional information.
Interest income. 
Interest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities.
Interest expense. 
Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Notes issued in May 2024, March 2021, and August 2019.
Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. 
We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined 
44
based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse.
We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that realization of the deferred tax assets, including consideration of our deferred tax liabilities, is not more likely than not. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we determined that a U.S. valuation allowance was no longer required. This determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors, including, but not limited to, our achievement of adjusted pre-tax income resulting in a three-year cumulative income position as of December 31, 2024, our full utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforward during 2024, and our projections of future pre-tax income. Based upon our assessment of all available evidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. We recognized an income tax benefit of $43.1 million in 2024, including $89.1 million related to the reversal of the previously-recorded valuation allowance. We have also recorded a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful to us and our investors in evaluating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide consistency and comparability with our past performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.

Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin
. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for amortization of acquired developed technology, stock-based compensation, and transaction-related costs (including, but not limited to, accounting, legal, and advisory fees related to the transaction, as well as transaction-related retention bonuses). Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison between periods.
Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin
. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is defined as GAAP income (loss) from operations adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, legal settlement gains or costs, and restructuring costs. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP income (loss) from operations divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by 
45
our acquisitions and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of income (loss) from operations between all periods presented.
Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to BlackLine and Diluted Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to BlackLine, Inc. 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to BlackLine is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to BlackLine adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt issuance costs from our 0.125% Convertible Senior Notes paid in 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2024 and 2026 Notes, the “Notes” or “convertible senior notes”), change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, legal settlement gains or costs, restructuring costs, adjustment to the redeemable non-controlling interest to the redemption amount, and gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes. Diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. includes the adjustment for shares resulting from the elimination of stock-based compensation. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to BlackLine is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by our acquisitions and other related costs to allow a direct comparison of net income (loss) between all periods presented.

The increase in total cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the following: 
•
$10.8 million increase in computer software expenses due to higher spend on cloud hosting services as customers continue to migrate to GCP, as well as upgrades to support business growth; 
•
$3.5 million increase in amortization of developed technology due to net additions of software placed into service; and 
•
$2.0 million increase in employee compensation and benefits driven primarily by an increase in average compensation per employee, partially offset by a decrease in average headcount; partially offset by
•
$1.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization due to certain assets being fully amortized; and

Refer to “Note 11 - Convertible Senior Notes” for additional information. We do not expect interest expense to fluctuate significantly over the next 12 months as the interest rates on our Notes are fixed.

N/M
We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we determined that our U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required. This determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors, including, but not limited to, our achievement of pre-tax income during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and each subsequent quarter since, our full utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforward during 2024, and our projections of future pre-tax income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our annual estimated effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily as a result of the $89.1 million release of our U.S. valuation allowance, along with state and foreign taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $43.1 million in income tax benefit and $1.5 million in income tax expense, respectively. The decrease in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted primarily from the 2024 release of $89.1 million of the 2023 U.S. valuation allowance, partially offset by our 2024 current and deferred federal and state income taxes of $44.6 million, and changes in the mix of profitable foreign jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were an aggregate of $885.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents consist of short-term, money market mutual funds.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, financing obligations, and share repurchases, if any, for at least the next 12 months.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
Convertible senior notes and capped calls
We had $905.2 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at December 31, 2024. We plan to, and believe we are able to, make all expected interest payments in the next 12 months.
In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions (the “2026 Capped Calls”) with certain counterparties covering, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 6.9 million shares of our common stock, and are generally expected to offset the potential economic dilution of our common stock upon any conversions of the 2026 Notes up to the initial cap price. The 2026 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $166.23 per share subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes and an initial cap price of $233.31 per share, subject to certain adjustments. As of December 31, 2024, all of the 2026 Capped Calls remained outstanding.
In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions (the “2029 Capped Calls” and together with the 2026 Capped Calls, the “Capped Calls”) with certain counterparties covering, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 9.9 million shares of our common stock and are generally expected to offset the potential economic dilution of our common stock upon any conversions of the 2029 Notes up to the initial cap price. The 2029 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $68.47 per share subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2029 Notes and an initial cap price of $92.17 per share, subject to certain adjustments. As of December 31, 2024, all of the 2029 Capped Calls remained outstanding.
Lease Liabilities
As of December 31, 2024, we have obligations totaling $23.9 million related to existing property and equipment leases.
Purchase Obligations
Purchase obligations represent our most significant contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the related goods or services, in whole or in part. At December 31, 2024, we have $216 million of contractual obligations related to eleven commitments, with $60 million payable within 12 months, and have additional contractual obligations with other vendors that are individually immaterial and which we can readily settle given our liquidity position and capital resources.
Contingent Consideration
As a condition of the FourQ Acquisition, we agreed to pay a maximum of $73.2 million of contingent consideration between January 2022 and January 2025 if certain financial performance milestones were met. At December 31, 2024, the related liability for the FourQ Acquisition was zero. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and we are no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of $73.2 million. Refer to “Note 16 - Contingent Consideration” for additional information.
Unrecognized Tax Liabilities
At December 31, 2024, while we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $18.7 million, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.

Repurchase Program
On November 17, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. The authorization will expire at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market repurchases or through privately-negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
52
amended. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock, and it may be suspended at any time in our discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have not repurchased any shares under the repurchase program.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors and officers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. We have never paid a material claim, nor have we been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. At December 31, 2024, we have not accrued a liability for these indemnification arrangements because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation, if any, in connection with these indemnification arrangements is not probable or reasonably estimable.
Future Capital Requirements
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, strategic relationships and international operations, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, future merger and acquisition activities, repurchase or refinancing of our existing indebtedness, repurchases of our common stock, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. From time to time, we have required, and may in the future require or opportunistically raise, additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise funds by borrowing from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements would require us to incur interest expense and may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available at all or, if available, that we would be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we would be required to curtail our operating activities and capital expenditures, and our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities
Our cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily influenced by our net income, as applicable, and cash generated from collections in accordance with our subscription-based revenue model wherein billings occur in advance of revenue recognition, as well as the substantial amount of non-cash charges that we incur. Non-cash activities primarily include stock-based compensation, a gain on extinguishment from the partial repurchase of our 2026 Notes, deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, accretion of discounts on marketable securities, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, non-cash lease expense, and amortization of debt issuance costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $190.8 million, resulting from net income of $167.8 million, net cash flow provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $16.8 
53
million, and net non-cash expenses of $6.3 million. The $16.8 million net cash flow provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected primarily the following:
•
$19.0 million increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by customer and user growth, and timing of collections for subscription and support;
•
$7.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to annual bonus accruals, cloud-based data storage services, and timing of foreign tax payments;
•
$2.7 million net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to a decrease in accrued interest and amortization of prepaid balances, partially offset by the timing of tax payments and prepaid cloud-based data storage costs to support our suite of solutions; and
•
$2.5 million decrease in other assets due to a net decrease in prepaid commissions, partially offset by cloud computing costs. 
These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the following:
•
$7.6 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by customer payments;
•
$6.0 million decrease in operating lease liabilities; and
•
$1.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $126.6 million, resulting from net non-cash expenses of $71.9 million and net income of $59.1 million, partially offset by a net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.4 million. The $4.4 million net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected the following:
•
$20.9 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, partially offset by customer payments;
•
$7.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities;
•
$6.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to increased insurance and software subscriptions, higher accrued interest, and increased capitalized commissions, partially offset by amortization of prepaid balances and interest received;
•
$5.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments;
•
$2.4 million paid for the 2013 Acquisition contingent consideration in excess of the acquisition date fair value (refer to “Note 16 - Contingent Consideration” for additional information);
•
$2.3 million decrease in other long-term liabilities primarily related to the FourQ Acquisition; and
•
$0.6 million increase in other assets due to increased prepaid commissions, partially offset by related amortization.
These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a $41.3 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to customer and user growth and timing of collections. 
Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities
Our investing activities consist primarily of investments in, and maturities and sales of marketable securities, capitalized software development costs, acquisitions of business entities, and capital expenditures for property and equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $924.4 million, primarily as a result of the following: 
•
$951.3 million of proceeds from maturities and sales, net of purchases of marketable securities; partially offset by
•
$24.7 million for capitalized software development costs; and
•
$2.1 million in purchases of property and equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $62.5 million as a result of the following: 
•
$23.5 million of purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities;
54
•
$21.6 million in capitalized software development costs;
•
$11.4 million paid for the DI Acquisition, net of cash acquired; and
•
$6.0 million in purchases of property and equipment.
Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $500.1 million, primarily as a result of the following: 
•
$848.5 million for the partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes;
•
$250.0 million for the repayment of the 2024 Notes with cash on hand;
•
$59.7 million for the purchase of the associated Capped Calls for the 2029 Notes; and
•
$17.5 million for acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations; partially offset by
•
$662.0 million of proceeds, net of debt issuance costs, from the issuance of the 2029 Notes;
•
$7.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options; and 
•
$7.0 million of proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $6.1 million, primarily as a result of the following: 
•
$19.8 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options; and 
•
$8.0 million of proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan.
These changes in our financing activities were partially offset by the following:
•
$15.0 million of acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations;
•
$5.6 million paid for the 2013 Acquisition contingent consideration (refer to “Note 16 - Contingent Consideration” for additional information); and
•
$1.0 million for finance lease payments.
Backlog
We enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. Backlog represents remaining revenue to be recognized under a non-cancelable contract with customers. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had backlog of approximately $879.4 million and $842.7 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and duration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance. We do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies and estimates, and are essential to a full understanding and evaluation of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Refer to “Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements” of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
55
Deferred Customer Acquisition Costs
We recognize an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs to our employees (“deferred customer contract acquisition costs”) and our partners (“partner referral fees”) meet the requirements to be capitalized. Deferred customer acquisition costs related to new revenue contracts and upsells are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit that we have determined to be five years, based upon both the product turnover rate and estimated customer life, which involves some level of judgment in terms of the inherent assumptions used. Partner referral fees are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from one year to five years. Deferred customer acquisition costs and partner referral fees are included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.
Capitalized Software Costs
We account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350
, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
. We capitalize certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These capitalized costs exclude training costs, project management costs, and data migration costs. We capitalize certain costs in the development of our SaaS subscription solutions when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project, and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include estimated personnel and related expenses for employees as well as costs of third-party contractors who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects and, when material, interest costs incurred during the development. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades and enhancements to our SaaS software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for post-configuration training, maintenance and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.
Business Combinations
The results of businesses acquired in business combinations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
We perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocate the purchase price to its respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires our management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations.
Contingent consideration payable in cash arising from business combinations is recorded at fair value as a liability on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Determining the fair value of the contingent consideration each period requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties, and if different assumptions had been used, the fair value of contingent consideration could have been materially different from the amounts recorded. The significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration was the amount and timing of new and incremental combined bookings from FourQ and BlackLine, and revenues from a specified FourQ customer over a three-year period subsequent to the acquisition.
Significant changes in these estimates and the periods in which they are generated would significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and we are no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of $73.2 million. Refer to “Note 16 - Contingent Consideration” for additional information.
Transaction-related costs incurred by us are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to “Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements” contained in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements, and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.
Item 7A.    
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
We have operations both within the U.S. and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange, and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our customers and limit credit exposure by collecting in advance and setting credit limits as we deem appropriate. In addition, our investment strategy has historically been to invest in financial instruments that are highly liquid and readily convertible into cash for use in our operations. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures. We have also not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates.
In March 2021, we issued $1.150 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and partially repurchased $919.8 million aggregate principal amount in May 2024. The 2026 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.0%; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the 2026 Notes. However, the fair value of the 2026 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. 
In May 2024, we issued $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.00%; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the 2029 Notes. However, the fair value of the 2029 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of the Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes is affected by our common stock price. The fair value of the Notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.
We had cash and cash equivalents of $885.9 million at December 31, 2024. Our cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market mutual funds. At December 31, 2024, we had no marketable securities, which prior to maturity, consisted of money market mutual funds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities, and U.S. government agencies. 
The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these instruments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Given the liquidity of our cash equivalents at December 31, 2024, we do not believe we have exposure to material risks due to changes in market interest rates. When we invest our excess cash in marketable securities in the future, our interest rate risk may increase.
We do not believe our cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future, our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. We cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits.
Foreign Currency Risk
While we primarily transact with customers in the U.S. Dollar, we also transact in foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Romanian Leu, and Singapore Dollar due to foreign operations and customer sales. We expect to continue to grow our foreign operations and customer sales. Our international subsidiaries maintain certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of these subsidiaries, which is the U.S. Dollar for all international subsidiaries, with the exception of our Japanese subsidiary, for which the Japanese Yen is the functional currency. Changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can result in fluctuations in our total assets, liabilities, revenue, operating expenses, and cash flows. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase 
57
or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have reduced by approximately $3.8 million or increased by approximately $3.8 million, respectively, our cash balances at December 31, 2024.
As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. Dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, since exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows. Based on the current level of foreign operations and customer sales, we do not plan on engaging in hedging activities in the near future.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackLine, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BlackLine, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible senior notes in 2022.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
60
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Certain Subscription and Support Revenue
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, customers pay subscription and support fees for access to the Company’s software as a service (SaaS) platform. The Company's subscription contracts have initial terms of one year to three years with renewal options. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. Subscription services, which includes support, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable contractual term of the arrangement, generally beginning on the date that the Company’s service is made available to the customer. The Company’s subscription and support revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $619.3 million, of which a majority pertains to certain of the Company’s subscription and support revenue. 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for certain subscription and support revenue is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to revenue recognized on certain of the Company’s subscription and support revenue.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the initiation, billing and recording of certain new and recurring subscriptions and the related subscription and support revenue. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing certain subscription and support revenue transactions, on a sample basis, by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, invoices, and cash receipts, and recalculating revenue recognized and the ending deferred revenue balance; (ii) confirming, on a sample basis, outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2024 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, invoices, subsequent cash receipts, and other source documents to support collectability of outstanding customer invoice balances; and (iii) testing the issuance of credit memos, on a sample basis, by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as credit memos, original invoices, and re-issued invoices.

BLACKLINE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – 
The Company
BlackLine, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “BlackLine”) provide financial accounting close solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). The Company’s solutions enable its customers to address various aspects of their critical processes, including financial close & consolidation, intercompany accounting, and invoice-to-cash.
The Company is a holding company and conducts its operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”).
On September 12, 2023, the Company acquired Data Interconnect (“DI”), hereinafter referred to as the “DI Acquisition”. DI is a cloud-based Invoice-to-Cash automation vendor within the electronic invoice presentment and payment (“EIPP”) market. The primary purpose of the DI Acquisition was to enhance the Company's existing accounts receivable automation solution by adding EIPP capabilities. This acquisition was not a significant acquisition under Regulation S-X, and the purchase accounting allocation is final.
On January 26, 2022, the Company acquired FourQ Systems, Inc. (“FourQ”), hereinafter referred to as the “FourQ Acquisition.” The primary purpose of the FourQ Acquisition was to enhance our existing intercompany accounting automation capabilities by driving end-to-end automation of traditionally manual intercompany accounting processes. This acquisition was not a significant acquisition under Regulation S-X, and the purchase accounting allocation is final.
The Company is headquartered in Woodland Hills, California. The Company has other local offices in Pleasanton, California; New York, New York; and Westport, Connecticut, as well as international office locations in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.

Note 2 – 
Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the operating results of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, primarily those related to determining the stand-alone selling price for separate deliverables in the Company’s subscription revenue arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, cancellations and credits, fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination, recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, useful lives associated with long-lived assets and right-of-use assets, income taxes, contingencies, fair value of contingent consideration, fair value of the 
0.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2026 and 
1.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2029, redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interest, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company at December 31, 2024 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s valuation of contingent consideration, the allowance for credit losses, and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s future assessment of these accounting matters and other factors could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
68
Segments
Management has determined that the Company has 
one
 operating segment. Together, our Co-Chief Executive Officers are the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and review the financial information on a consolidated and aggregate basis, together with certain operating metrics principally to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to measure the Company’s performance.
Concentration of credit risk and significant customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains the majority of its cash balances with 
one
 major commercial bank in interest-bearing accounts, which exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, federally insured limits. The Company invests its excess cash in money market mutual funds with 
two
 major investment banks. To date, the Company has not experienced any impairment losses on its investments.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 
no
 single customer comprised 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues. 
No
 single customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes cash held in checking and savings accounts. Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in money market mutual funds. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Restricted cash
Included in other assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets was $
0.2
 million and $
0.2
 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash was required to be restricted for use by the Company’s office leaseholder to collateralize a standby letter of credit.
Investments in marketable securities
The Company periodically assesses its portfolio of marketable securities for impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessment first takes into account the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net.
For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company assesses whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through other income (expense), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any additional impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.
Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
 The Company has 
no
t recorded any credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges for unrealized losses in the periods presented.
Accounts receivable and credit losses
Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. The Company makes estimates of expected credit losses and cancellations and credits based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect its ability to collect from customers. The estimated credit loss allowance is recorded as general and administrative expenses, while the estimated credit loss 
69
allowance for cancellations and credits is recorded as a reduction in revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
The Company has leases for office space, equipment, and data centers. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception if the Company is both able to identify an asset and can conclude it has the right to control the identified asset for a period of time. Leases are included in property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, finance lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has made accounting policy elections, including a short-term lease exception policy, permitting the Company to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with expected terms of 12 months or less), and an accounting policy to account for lease and certain non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. The portfolio approach, which allows a lessee to account for its leases at a portfolio level, was elected for certain equipment leases in which the difference in accounting for each asset separately would not have been materially different from accounting for the assets as a combined unit.
Finance lease assets and operating lease ROU assets represent the Company's right to control an underlying asset for the lease term. Finance lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date or remeasurement date to determine the discount rate used to present value lease payments for finance and operating leases. The incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what the Company would be required to pay for a collateralized loan over a similar term. Additionally, the Company generally uses the portfolio approach when applying the discount rate selected based on the dollar amount and term of the obligation. The Company’s leases typically do not include any residual value guarantees, bargain purchase options, or asset retirement obligations. 
The Company’s lease terms are only for periods in which it has enforceable rights. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancellable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. A lease is no longer enforceable when both the lessee and the lessor each have the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. The Company’s lease terms are impacted by options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
The Company’s agreements may contain variable lease payments. The Company includes variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and excludes those which depend on facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the lease assets and liabilities.
Judgment is required when determining whether any of the Company’s data center contracts contain a lease. The Company concluded a lease exists when the asset is specifically identifiable, substantially all the economic benefit of the asset is obtained, and the right to direct the use of the asset exists during the term of the lease.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally 
three
 to 
five years
 for machinery and equipment and purchased software, and 
five years
 for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or 
seven years
. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation expense is charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Capitalized internal-use software costs
The Company capitalizes certain costs in the development of its SaaS subscription solution when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project, and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related expenses for employees and costs of third-party contractors who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades and enhancements to the Company’s SaaS software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for 
70
training, maintenance and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 
three years
.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company amortized $
22.6
 million, $
19.1
 million, and $
13.6
 million, respectively, of internal-use software development costs to subscription and support cost of revenues. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the accumulated amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs was $
83.2
 million and $
60.6
 million, respectively.
The Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These capitalized costs exclude training costs, project management costs, and data migration costs. Capitalized software implementation costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the associated hosting arrangements.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names, which were acquired as part of purchase business combinations, as well as a defensive patent that was acquired through a purchase agreement. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of its intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 
three
 to 
11
 years.

Impairment of long-lived assets
Management evaluates the recoverability of the Company’s property and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and capitalized internal-software costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. Events and changes in circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. Impairment testing is performed at an asset level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (an “asset group”). In determining if impairment exists, the Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows for the asset group are less than its net book value, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did 
not
 record any charges for the impairment of cloud computing implementation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized charges for the impairment of cloud computing implementation costs of $
5.3
 million.

Business combinations
The results of businesses acquired in business combinations are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business generally being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocates the purchase price to its respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, and the contingent consideration liability requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, significant changes in the use of the acquired assets or the Company’s strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.
71
An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test.
The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
The Company has 
one
 reporting unit, and it tests its goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company used the quantitative approach to perform its annual goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the Company's reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of its net assets and, accordingly, goodwill was not impaired.
Redeemable non-controlling interest
The Company's Japanese subsidiary (“BlackLine K.K.”) is not wholly owned. The agreements with the minority investors of BlackLine K.K. contain redemption features whereby the interest held by the minority investors are redeemable either (i) at the option of the minority investors or (ii) at the option of the Company, both beginning on the seventh anniversary of the initial capital contribution. If the interest of the minority investors were to be redeemed under these agreements, the Company would be required to redeem the interest based on a prescribed formula derived from the relative revenue of BlackLine K.K. and the Company. The balance of the redeemable non-controlling interest is reported at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest's share of earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, or its estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount (increases or decreases) are recorded with corresponding adjustments against retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital. These interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable non-controlling interest.”
Convertible senior notes
The Company accounts for the issued Notes as a liability at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are being amortized to expense over the respective term of the Notes. To the extent that the Company receives conversion requests prior to the maturity of the Notes, upon settlement of the conversion requests, the difference between the fair value and the amortized book value of the Notes requested for conversion is recorded as a gain or loss on early conversion. The fair value of the Notes are measured based on a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature based on the remaining term of the Notes, which requires significant judgment.
Restructuring costs
The Company records a charge for restructuring when management commits to a restructuring plan, the restructuring plan identifies all significant actions, the period of time to complete the restructuring plan indicates that significant changes to the restructuring plan are not likely, and employees who are impacted have been notified of the pending involuntary termination.
Fair value of financial instruments
ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement,
 requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
Level 1:    
Quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities.
Level 2:    
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities.
72
Level 3:    
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of such instruments.
Contingent consideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value as a liability on the acquisition date and is remeasured at each reporting date, based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of contingent consideration uses assumptions management believes would be made by a market participant. Management assesses these estimates on an ongoing basis as additional data impacting the assumptions becomes available. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to updated assumptions and estimates are recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
To determine the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the FourQ Acquisition, management utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the earnout based on the likelihood of reaching firm-specific targets. Significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the amount and timing of new and incremental combined bookings from FourQ and BlackLine, and revenues from a specified FourQ customer over a 
three
-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, as well as the discount rate.
Certain assets, including goodwill and long-lived assets, are also subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis if they are deemed to be impaired as a result of an impairment review.
 Refer to “Impairment of long-lived assets
” 
section above for additional information.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of subscription and support services and professional services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s agreements do not contain any refund provisions other than in the event of the Company’s non-performance or breach.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue net of any applicable value added or sales tax.
Subscription and support revenue 
– Customers pay subscription and support fees for access to the Company’s SaaS platform. Our subscription contracts have initial terms of 
one year
 to 
three years
 with renewal options. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. Subscription services, which includes support, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable contractual term of the arrangement, generally beginning on the date that the Company’s service is made available to the customer. 
Subscription and support revenue also includes software and related maintenance and support fees on perpetual licenses. Revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized immediately at the time the Company provides the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may have purchased perpetual licenses or term-based licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
Professional services revenue 
– Professional services consist of implementation and consulting services to assist the Company’s customers as they deploy our solutions. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. The Company applies the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when it has the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. The Company applies the optional exemption and has excluded the variable consideration from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations 
– The Company’s contracts with customers often contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations 
73
separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, as well as the determination of SSP for each distinct performance obligation, may require significant judgment. The Company typically has more than one SSP for its SaaS solutions and professional services. Additionally, management has determined that there are no third-party offerings reasonably comparable to the Company’s solutions. Therefore, the Company determines the SSPs of subscriptions to the SaaS solutions and professional services based on numerous factors including the Company’s overall pricing objectives, geography, customer size, number of users, and discounting practices.

The Company uses historical maintenance renewal fees to estimate SSP for maintenance and support fees bundled with software licenses. The Company uses the residual method to estimate SSP of software licenses, because license pricing is highly variable and not sold separately from maintenance and support.
Contract balances 
– Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, and deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. The Company generally invoices customers annually at the beginning of each annual contract period. 
Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of billings in advance of revenue being recognized related to the Company’s subscription and support services and professional services arrangements.
Changes in deferred revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were primarily due to additional billings in the periods, partially offset by revenue recognized of $
316.7
 million, $
274.3
 million, and $
239.9
 million, respectively, that was previously included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
The transaction price is generally determined by the stated fixed fees in the contract, excluding any related sales taxes. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (“contracted not recognized”), which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $
879.4
 million at December 31, 2024, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 
57.6
% over the next 
12
 months and the remainder thereafter.
Fees are generally due and payable within 30 days. None of the Company’s contracts include a significant financing component.
Assets recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer 
– The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company expects the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. The Company has determined that certain sales incentive programs to the Company’s employees (“deferred customer contract acquisition costs”) and its partners (“partner referral fees”) meet the requirements to be capitalized. Deferred customer acquisition costs related to new revenue contracts and upsells are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which the Company has determined to be 
five years
, based upon both the product turnover rate and estimated customer life. The Company enters into partnership arrangements where partner referral fees are paid either on the initial contract or on both the initial contract and renewal of the contract. The Company assesses whether the renewal fee is commensurate with the initial fee. When the renewal fee is commensurate with the initial fee, the Company amortizes the deferred costs over the initial year of the contract. Otherwise, the initial fee is amortized over 
five years
. Deferred customer acquisition costs and partner referral fees are included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
 There were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.
Amortization expense related to the asset recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and was $
37.0
 million, $
34.1
 million, and $
29.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company’s cloud-based application suite, salaries and benefits of operations and support personnel, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. The Company allocates a portion of overhead, such as rent, information technology costs and depreciation and amortization to cost of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. In addition, subscription and support cost of revenues includes amortization of acquired developed technology.
74
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, including stock-based compensation, of sales and marketing personnel and related sales support teams, sales and partner commissions, marketing events, advertising costs, computer software-related costs, travel, trade shows, other marketing materials, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets, transaction-related costs, and impairment of cloud computing implementation costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $
11.6
 million, $
11.8
 million, and $
9.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Research and development
Research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with the Company’s engineering, product and quality assurance personnel. Research and development expenses also include third-party contractors and supplies, computer software-related costs, transaction-related costs, and allocated overhead. Other than software development costs that qualify for capitalization, as discussed above, research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with the Company’s executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional fees, other corporate-related expenses and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not-to-compete and trade name intangible assets, the change in value of the contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, and impairment of cloud computing implementation costs.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors based on the awards’ estimated grant date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For awards that vest solely based on continued service (“service-only vesting conditions”), the resulting fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period, which is generally 
four years
. 
The Company recognizes the fair value of restricted stock units with performance and service conditions based upon the probability of the performance conditions being met, using the graded vesting method. The Company recognizes the fair value of restricted stock units with market and service conditions based upon the achievement of total stockholder return (“TSR”) relative to an industry index being met, using the graded vesting method. The Company estimates the fair value of its restricted stock units with market and service conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, which requires the use of various assumptions, including the stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating a forfeiture rate. 
The Company recognizes the fair value of ESPP shares using the Black-Scholes option valuation model based on the following assumptions:
Expected volatility. 
The expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected term.
Expected term. 
The expected term represents the amount of time remaining in the offering period.
Risk-free interest rate. 
The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant corresponding to the expected term of the ESPP share.
Estimated dividend yield. 
The estimated dividend yield is 
zero
, as the Company does not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.
Share Repurchase Program
On November 17, 2024, the Board of Directors (“the Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to $
200.0
 million of the Company’s common stock. The authorization will expire at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2027.
Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market repurchases or through privately-negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate the 
75
Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.

Income taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions, if any, in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
Net income (loss) per share
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. 
For periods where the Company reports net income, the Company will calculate diluted net income per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. by adjusting the denominator for potentially dilutive common shares, which are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock underlying stock options and unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method, as well as for the potential impact of our Notes using the if-converted method or the treasury stock method, as applicable. Under the if-converted method, the numerator is adjusted by adding back interest expense, net of any tax impact. 
For periods where the Company reports net losses, the Company will calculate diluted net loss per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. by excluding from the denominator potentially dilutive common shares, which are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock underlying stock options and unvested stock awards, as well as the potential impact of our Notes, as they are antidilutive. For these periods, basic net loss per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. is equivalent to diluted net loss per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc.
Foreign currency
The Company’s functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar (“USD”), with the exception of its BlackLine K.K. subsidiary, for which the Japanese Yen is the functional currency. The foreign exchange impacts of remeasuring the local currency of the foreign subsidiaries to the functional currency is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign operations are remeasured at balance sheet date exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities and equity are remeasured at the historical exchange rates, while results of operations are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect for the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses consist of both realized and unrealized gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction losses totaled $
3.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, foreign currency transaction gains totaled $
0.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and foreign currency transaction losses totaled $
2.1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The financial statements of BlackLine K.K. are translated to USD using balance sheet date exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities, historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities and equity, and average exchange rates in the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

Note 3 – 
Segment Information
Management has determined that the Company has 
one
 operating and reportable segment. The Company provides subscription and support services that consist of a cloud-based platform designed to unify, automate, and streamline accounting and finance operations, and also provides professional services that consist of implementation and consulting services. The technology used in the subscription and support services is based on a single software platform that is deployed to and implemented by customers. The Company manages the business activities on a consolidated basis, and operating segments have not been aggregated. The accounting policies of the operating segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
Our CODM assesses performance for the operating segment and decides how to allocate resources based on the review of net income (loss). The CODM uses net income (loss), among other measures, for budgeting and resource allocation purposes. Expenses significant to the segment were determined to be cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, which are all presented in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Other significant expenses include depreciation expense of $
30.5
 million, $
29.5
 million, and $
23.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, as well as amortization expense of $
19.9
 million, $
20.6
 million, and $
19.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The Company’s intra-entity sales are eliminated upon consolidation.
The Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location, as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Note 4 – 
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest
In September 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Japanese Cloud Computing and M30 LLC (the “Investors”) to engage in the investment, organization, management, and operation of BlackLine K.K. that is focused on the sale of the Company's products in Japan. The Company initially contributed approximately $
4.5
 million in cash in exchange for 
51
% of the outstanding common stock of BlackLine K.K. and subsequently invested a further $
2.3
 million, maintaining the Company's majority ownership of 
51
%. As the Company continues to control a majority stake in BlackLine K.K., the entity has been consolidated.
All of the common stock held by the Investors is callable by the Company or puttable by the Investors upon certain contingent events. Should the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value will be determined based upon a prescribed formula derived from the discrete revenues of BlackLine K.K. and the Company, and may be settled, at the Company’s discretion, with Company stock or cash. As a result of the put right available to the Investors in the future, the redeemable non-controlling interest in BlackLine K.K. is classified outside of permanent equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and the balance is reported at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest's share of earnings, or its estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount are recorded within retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital.

Business Combinations 
Acquisition of Data Interconnect
On September 12, 2023, the Company completed the DI Acquisition for cash consideration of $
11.4
 million, which was paid at the closing of the acquisition. The DI Acquisition enhances the Company's existing accounts receivable automation solution capabilities through EIPP. Transaction-related costs, which include, but are not limited to, accounting, legal, and advisory fees related to the transaction, incurred by the Company totaling approximately $
1.2
 million were expensed as incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
The Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation was finalized as of the filing date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company believes the amount of goodwill resulting from the acquisition is primarily attributable to increased offerings to customers and enhanced opportunities for growth and innovation. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is not tax deductible.
To determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist management. All estimates, key assumptions, and forecasts were either provided by, or reviewed by, the Company. While the Company chose to utilize a third-party valuation specialist for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of the Company and not those of any third party. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets were based primarily on significant unobservable inputs and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. 
The acquired intangible asset categories, fair value, and amortization periods, were as follows:

The estimated fair value of developed technology and customer relationships acquired of $
8.1
 million and $
0.7
 million, respectively, was determined through the use of a third-party valuation firm using the cost approach methodology. The cost approach considers the cost to replace (or reproduce) the assets and the effects on the assets' values of functional and/or economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset. The direct transaction costs of the acquisition were accounted for separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. 
The revenue and earnings of the acquired business were included in the Company’s results since the acquisition date and have not been presented separately using pro forma revenues and results of operations as its impact is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.
FourQ Systems, Inc.
On January 26, 2022, the Company completed the FourQ Acquisition for cash consideration of $
160.2
 million payable at the closing of the acquisition. In addition, the Company agreed to pay a maximum of $
73.2
 million of contingent consideration if certain earnout conditions were met. At January 26, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $
55.9
 million and was included in contingent consideration on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and the Company is no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of 
79
$
73.2
 million. See “Note 16 - Contingent Consideration” for additional information regarding the valuation of the contingent consideration at December 31, 2024.
The FourQ Acquisition enhances the Company's existing intercompany accounting automation capabilities by driving end-to-end automation of traditionally manual intercompany accounting processes.

The Company incurred transaction-related costs, which include, but are not limited to, fees for accounting, legal, and advisory services of $
3.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The transaction-related costs were expensed as incurred. 
The Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

The identified intangible assets, developed technology and customer relationships, were valued as follows:
Developed technology – The Company valued the finite-lived developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings model under the income approach. This method estimates an intangible asset’s value based on the 
80
present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset. The Company applied judgment which involves the use of significant assumptions with respect to the discount rate, obsolescence rate, revenue forecasts, research and development costs for future technology, and EBITDA forecasts. 
Customer relationships – The Company valued the finite-lived customer relationships using the differential cash flow (with-and-without) model, an income approach. This method assumes that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the difference between the present value of the prospective cash flows with the intangible asset in place and the present value of the prospective cash flows without the intangible asset. The Company applied judgment, which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to the discount rate and the customer ramp-up rate.

The Company classified the marketable debt securities as available-for-sale debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluated such classification as of each balance sheet date. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classified as Level 1 were derived from quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments were derived from broker reports that utilized quoted market prices for similar instruments.
As a condition of the FourQ Acquisition that occurred on January 26, 2022, the Company agreed to pay additional cash consideration if FourQ realized certain firm-specific targets, including the amount and timing of new and incremental combined bookings from FourQ and BlackLine, and revenues from a specified FourQ customer over a 
three
-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The maximum cash consideration to be distributed is $
73.2
 million. Changes in the significant inputs used in the fair value measurement, specifically a change in new and incremental actual and forecasted combined bookings from FourQ and the Company, can significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. At December 31, 2024, the related liability for the FourQ Acquisition was 
zero
. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and the Company is no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of $
73.2
 million.
Increases and decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded as expense or reversals of expense, respectively, within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Note 11 – 
Convertible Senior Notes
2029 Notes
On May 24, 2024 and June 5, 2024, the Company issued $
600.0
 million aggregate principal amount, and an additional aggregate principal amount in connection with the initial purchasers’ option of $
75.0
 million, respectively, of 
1.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 
0.125
% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and the 
0.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), the “Notes”), in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). The 2029 Notes were sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “2029 Indenture”), by and between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 
1.00
% per annum on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. The 2029 Notes will mature on June 1, 2029, unless redeemed, repurchased, or converted prior to such date in accordance with their terms.
The initial conversion rate of the 2029 Notes is 14.6047 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
68.47
 per share of common stock. 
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events. Upon conversion, the Company will pay, or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. It is the Company’s current intent to settle conversions of the 2029 Notes through “combination settlement”, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares, cash, or a combination for any further value.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2029, the 2029 Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances:
(1)    during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes on each applicable trading day;
(2)    during the 
five
 business-day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
(3)    if the Company calls any or all of the 2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
(4)    upon the occurrence of specified corporate events set forth in the 2029 Indenture.
If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the 2029 Indenture, prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2029 Notes for cash at a price equal to 
85
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2029 Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2029 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company.
The 2029 Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the 2029 Notes and provides that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, the Trustee may, and the Trustee at the request of holders of at least 
25
% in principal amount of the 2029 Notes shall, declare all principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of the 2029 Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, involving the Company, all of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2029 Notes will automatically become due and payable.
The 2029 Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):

Net carrying amount
$
663,506

The effective interest rate of the 2029 Notes, excluding the conversion option, was 
1.40
% at December 31, 2024.
The Company carries the 2029 Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and presents the fair value for disclosure purposes only. The estimated fair value was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the 2029 Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period. The estimated fair value of the 2029 Notes, based on a market approach at December 31, 2024, was approximately $
729.4
 million, which represents a Level 2 valuation.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
1.5
 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $
4.1
 million of coupon interest expense.
The 2029 Notes were not convertible at December 31, 2024.
2026 Notes
In March 2021, the Company issued $
1.150
 billion aggregate gross proceeds, which included the initial purchasers’ option of $
150.0
 million aggregate principal amount, of the 2026 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2026 Notes were sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “2026 Indenture”), by and between the Company and the Trustee.
The 2026 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes does not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to the Company’s failure to comply with its reporting obligations under the 2026 Indenture or if the 2026 Notes are not freely tradeable as required by the 2026 Indenture. The 2026 Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless redeemed, repurchased, or converted prior to such date in accordance with their terms.
The initial conversion rate of the 2026 Notes is 6.0156 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
166.23
 per share of common stock.
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. It is the Company’s current intent to settle conversions of the 2026 Notes through “combination settlement”, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of its common stock.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025, the 2026 Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 
86
(1)    during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day; 
(2)    during the 
five
 business-day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
(3)    if the Company calls any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
(4)    upon the occurrence of specified corporate events set forth in the 2026 Indenture. 
If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the 2026 Indenture, prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2026 Notes for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2026 Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company.
The 2026 Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the 2026 Notes and provides that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, the Trustee may, and the Trustee at the request of holders of at least 
25
% in principal amount of the 2026 Notes shall, declare all principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of the 2026 Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, involving the Company, all of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2026 Notes will automatically become due and payable.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, in accounting for the issuance of the 2026 Notes, management allocated the proceeds of the 2026 Notes between liability and equity components. To estimate the fair value of the liability component, management measured the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated conversion feature by discounting the contractual cash flows of the 2026 Notes at an estimated interest rate for a comparable non-convertible note. The Company applied judgment to determine the interest rate of 
5.65
%, which was estimated based on the credit spread implied by the 2026 Notes issuance. Significant inputs used in the model to determine the applicable interest rate include implied volatility over the term of the 2026 Notes. The equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the 2026 Notes and the equity component totaling $
276.3
 million was recorded as a debt discount. In addition, the Company incurred $
21.2
 million of transaction costs related to the 2026 Notes, of which $
16.1
 million and $
5.1
 million, respectively, was allocated to the liability and equity components of the 2026 Notes. Transaction costs allocated to the equity component were recorded as additional debt discount. The equity component of the 2026 Notes was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. The debt discount was amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2026 Notes using the effective interest method. Additionally, the Company recorded, through equity, a deferred tax liability of $
2.4
 million, net of the related change in the valuation allowance, related to the debt issuance costs on the 2026 Notes.
In connection with the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company reclassified the remaining balance of the conversion feature of $
271.2
 million from additional paid-in capital to convertible debt for $
233.4
 million and retained earnings for $
37.8
 million. Accordingly, the Company no longer carries an equity component of the Notes, and no longer incurs non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount associated with the embedded conversion option.
In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the Company used approximately $
662.6
 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes, as well as liquid investments on hand of $
185.9
 million to repurchase $
919.8
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The difference between the consideration paid and the carrying value of the repurchased 2026 Notes, inclusive of any unamortized debt issuance costs, was recognized as a gain on extinguishment of $
65.1
 million in other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Company carries the 2026 Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and presents the fair value for disclosure purposes only. The estimated fair value was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the 2026 Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period. The estimated fair value of the 2026 Notes, based on a market approach at December 31, 2024, was approximately $

2029 Capped Calls
In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “2029 Capped Calls” and together with the 2024 and 2026 Capped Calls, the “Capped Calls”) with certain counterparties at a cost of approximately $
59.7
 million, which was recorded as a reduction of the Company’s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
88
Under the 2029 Capped Calls, the Company purchased capped call options that initially cover in the aggregate the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock that initially underlie the 2029 Notes, with an exercise price equal to the initial conversion price of the 2029 Notes, and a cap price of $
92.17
 per share of common stock, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2029 Capped Calls.
By entering into the 2029 Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes (or, in the event a conversion of the 2029 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2029 Notes, the market value per share of its common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 2029 Notes, with such reduction subject to the cap price.
The cost of the 2029 Capped Calls is not expected to be tax deductible as the Company did not elect to integrate the 2029 Capped Calls into the 2029 Notes for tax purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, all of the 2029 Capped Calls remained outstanding.
2026 Capped Calls
In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions (the “2026 Capped Calls”) with certain counterparties covering, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
6.9
 million shares of our common stock and are generally expected to offset the potential economic dilution of our common stock up to the initial cap price. The 2026 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $
166.23
 per share - subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes - and an initial cap price of $
233.31
 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
The Company entered into the 2026 Capped Calls at a cost of approximately $
102.4
 million, which was recorded as a reduction of the Company’s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. By entering into the 2026 Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes (or, in the event a conversion of the 2026 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2026 Notes, the market value per share of its common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 2026 Notes, with such reduction subject to the cap price. The cost of the 2026 Capped Calls is not expected to be tax deductible as the Company did not elect to integrate the 2026 Capped Calls into the 2026 Notes for tax purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, all of the 2026 Capped Calls remained outstanding.
2024 Capped Calls
In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions (the “2024 Capped Calls”). All remaining 2024 Capped Calls expired upon the maturity of the 2024 Notes on August 1, 2024.

Equity Awards
2014 and 2016 Plans
On March 3, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). In November 2016, upon the completion of the Company’s initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) and determined that it will no longer grant any additional awards under the 2014 Plan. However, the 2014 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under the 2014 plan. Upon the adoption of the 2016 Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable was 
6.2
 million, plus a number of shares equal to the number of shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the 2014 Plan after the date the 2014 Plan is terminated without having been exercised in full. The Company’s Board may grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants under the 2016 Plan. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2016 Plan and the number of shares subject to outstanding options automatically adjusts for any changes in the Company’s outstanding common stock by reason of any recapitalization, spin-off, reorganization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction. Stock options and restricted stock units generally vest over 
three
 to 
four years
 and have contractual terms of 
ten years
.
At December 31, 2024, 
20.4
 million shares were available for issuance under the 2016 Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Company’s 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible employees are granted the right to purchase shares at the lower of 
85
% of the fair value of the stock at the time of grant or 
85
% of the fair value at the time of exercise. The right to purchase shares is granted twice yearly for six month offering periods in May and November and exercisable on or about the succeeding November and May, respectively, of each year. Under the ESPP, 
0.6
 million shares remained available for issuance at December 31, 2024. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP of $

ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences, and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is “more likely than not.” A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined that the $
89.1
 million U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required. This determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors, including, but not limited to, the Company’s achievement of adjusted pre-tax income resulting in a three-year cumulative income position as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s full utilization of its federal net operating loss carryforward during 2024, and the Company’s projections of future pre-tax income. Based on available objective evidence, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024.
The changes in the valuation allowance were as follows (in thousands):

The decrease in valuation allowance recorded through equity of $

64.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from the adoption of ASU 2020-06, which required the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with the Company’s 2024 and 2026 Notes.

The decrease in valuation allowance recorded through earnings of $
87.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted primarily from the release of valuation allowance previously recorded against its U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign deferred tax assets. 
The decrease in valuation allowance recorded through earnings of $
7.1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from the utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due 
94
to domestic profitability, along with the valuation allowance decrease associated with net deferred tax liabilities from the DI Acquisition, which are a source of taxable income to support the recognition of existing UK deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release resulted in a UK deferred tax benefit of $
1.7
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
The increase in valuation allowance recorded through earnings of $
2.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from the effects of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, partially offset by the valuation allowance decrease associated with net deferred tax liabilities acquired from FourQ which are a source of taxable income to support the recognition of existing BlackLine deferred tax assets. The Company elected to consider the recoverability of the acquired deferred tax assets before existing BlackLine deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release associated with the acquired FourQ net deferred tax liabilities resulted in a U.S. deferred tax benefit of $
14.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
The Company did not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings and other outside temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside temporary differences upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is immaterial to these consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had consolidated state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately $
68.0
 million. The state losses will begin to expire between 2031 and 2041, depending on the jurisdiction. The Company has federal research and development credits of $
5.9
 million, which begin to expire in 2043. The Company has state research and development credits of $
10.7
 million, which are indefinite in expiration. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, use of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if the Company experiences a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% over a three-year period. 
The following is a rollforward of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

At December 31, 2024, included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits is $
18.7
 million, that if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company recorded less than $
0.1
 million interest and penalties in its provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and less than $
0.1
 million was accrued in interest and penalties at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The Company files U.S. federal, various state, and foreign income tax returns. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities. The tax years from 2013 forward remain subject to examination for federal purposes. Generally, state and foreign tax authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for four years and five years, respectively, from the date an income tax return is filed. However, the taxing authorities may continue to examine the Company’s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards until the statute of limitations closes on the tax years in which the federal and state net operating losses are utilized.
The Company regularly evaluates any necessary changes to their uncertain tax positions. During 2024 the Company remeasured their uncertain tax position reserve which resulted in an increase to prior year positions of $
9.2
 million. The Company does not anticipate material changes in the total amount or composition of its unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date.

The Company computes basic earnings per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The Company computes diluted earnings per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive shares, which is based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying stock options and unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method, and the effect of the convertible senior notes using the if-converted method. 
The weighted average impact of potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the diluted per share calculations because they were anti-dilutive were as follows (in thousands):

The denominator for diluted net income per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. does not include any effect from the Capped Calls as this effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Notes, shares delivered to the Company under the Capped Calls would offset the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company would issue under the Notes. Refer to “Note 11 - Convertible Senior Notes” for additional information on the Notes and the related Capped Calls.

Note 16 – 
Contingent Consideration
As a condition of the FourQ Acquisition that occurred on January 26, 2022, the Company agreed to pay additional cash consideration if FourQ realized certain firm-specific targets, including the amount and timing of new and incremental combined bookings from FourQ and BlackLine, and revenues from a specified FourQ customer 
96
over a 
three-year
 period subsequent to the acquisition date. The maximum cash consideration to be distributed is $
73.2
 million. Changes in the significant inputs used in the fair value measurement, specifically a change in new and incremental actual and forecasted combined bookings from FourQ and the Company, can significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. As of December 31, 2024, the FourQ contingent consideration was 
zero
. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the financial performance milestones were not met, and the Company is no longer obligated to pay the contingent consideration of $
73.2
 million. Refer to “Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements” for additional information regarding the valuation of the contingent consideration.
In conjunction with the 2013 Acquisition, option holders of BlackLine Systems were allowed to cancel their stock option rights and receive a cash payment equal to the amount of calculated gain (less applicable expense and other items) had they exercised their stock options and then sold their common shares as part of the 2013 Acquisition. As a condition of the 2013 Acquisition, the Company was obligated to pay additional cash consideration to certain equity holders since the Company realized taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The maximum contingent cash consideration of $
8.0
 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced the liability to 
zero
.
Increases and decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded as expense or reversals of expense, respectively, within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Note 17 – 
Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
—From time to time, the Company may become subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, nor is it aware of any pending or threatened litigation that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
Indemnification
—In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors, and officers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of its breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. The Company has never paid a material claim, nor has it been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not accrued a liability for these indemnification arrangements because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation, if any, in connection with these indemnification arrangements was not probable or reasonably estimable.
Note 18 – 
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan (the “Plan”) that covers substantially all domestic employees. The Company makes matching contributions of 
100
% of each $1 of the employee’s contribution up to the first 
3
% of the employee’s semi-monthly compensation and 
50
% of each $1 of the employee’s contribution up to the next 
2
% of the employee’s semi-monthly compensation. Matching contributions to the Plan recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations totaled $
7.2
 million, $
7.6
 million, and $
7.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Note 19 – 
Subsequent Events 
On February 12, 2025, the Compensation Committee approved restricted stock unit grants to employees totaling 
0.1
 million shares. Each restricted stock unit entitles the recipient to receive 
one
 share of common stock upon vesting of the award. The restricted stock units are service-based and will vest as to one-fourth of the total number of units awarded on the first anniversary of February 20, 2025 and quarterly thereafter for 12 consecutive quarters.
On February 12, 2025, the Compensation Committee approved the performance metrics for the 2025 performance period, resulting in the establishment of accounting grant dates for the third tranche of the 2023 and second tranche of the 2024 performance and service-based restricted stock units totaling 
0.2
 million target shares.

Item 9A.    
Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or “the Exchange Act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2024, the last day of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer have concluded that, at December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and our management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
