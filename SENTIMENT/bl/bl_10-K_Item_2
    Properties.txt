Item 2.
    Properties
Our principal executive offices are located in Woodland Hills, California where we occupy approximately 89,000 square feet of space under a lease that expires in January 2029. We have additional U.S. leased offices in Pleasanton, California; New York, New York; and Westport, Connecticut. We also have international office locations in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. We believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional space in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
