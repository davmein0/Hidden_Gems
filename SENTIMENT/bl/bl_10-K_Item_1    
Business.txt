Business
Overview
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is relied upon to deliver timely and accurate financial reporting and business insights. Yet finance and accounting teams are facing unprecedented system and process complexity, growing data volumes, and evolving regulatory requirements, coupled with expanding roles and responsibilities. As a result, digital transformation has become a top priority for CFOs, as they require powerful technology to meet these demands.
At BlackLine, our mission is to inspire, power, and guide digital finance transformation for the Office of the CFO. Our secure, flexible, and scalable cloud-based platform empowers finance and accounting teams to achieve future-ready financial operations, modernizing processes for mid-size and enterprise organizations across all industries.
For many organizations, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems manage general ledger activities but do not address end-to-end processes performed across other systems and outside those systems in spreadsheets, impeding organizations’ ability to provide reliable data and insights. Our platform connects data and processes at their origin, enhancing financial reporting integrity, streamlining activities, and delivering faster insights. This approach drives immediate impact and sustained value, maximizing cash flows, and accelerating the record-to-report and invoice-to-cash cycles.
BlackLine integrates with over 30 leading ERP systems, including SAP SE (“SAP”), Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Dynamics 365 (“Microsoft Dynamics”), an application offered by Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Sage Intacct, Inc., and NetSuite, Inc. It also connects with diverse financial data sources, such as banks, point-of-sale, treasury, payroll, procurement, and other systems, bringing data into unified workflows. This deep connectivity provides finance and accounting teams with accurate, actionable insights, reducing errors, improving compliance, and freeing time for strategic analysis.

For over 20 years, BlackLine has pioneered customer-centric innovation in financial software, optimizing mission-critical processes for the Office of the CFO. Our latest innovation, the BlackLine Studio360 Platform, uniquely addresses the increasing complexity of data, systems, and processes. 
BlackLine was founded in 2001. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”) and its subsidiaries.
On September 12, 2023, we acquired Data Interconnect (“DI”), hereinafter referred to as the “DI Acquisition”. DI is a cloud-based invoice-to-cash automation vendor within the electronic invoice presentment and payment (“EIPP”) market. The primary purpose of the DI Acquisition was to complete our existing accounts receivable automation solution by adding EIPP capabilities to our platform. In doing so, we now offer a complete end-to-end invoice-to-cash process within the platform. 
On January 26, 2022, we acquired FourQ Systems, Inc. (“FourQ”), which we refer to as the “FourQ Acquisition.” The primary purpose of the FourQ Acquisition was to enhance our existing intercompany accounting automation capabilities by driving end-to-end automation of traditionally manual intercompany accounting processes. 
Our cloud-based applications, increasingly powered by our BlackLine Studio360 Platform, include Account Reconciliations, Transaction Matching, Task Management, Financial Reporting Analytics, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Compliance, Smart Close for SAP, Cash Application, Credit & Risk Management, Collections Management, Disputes & Deductions Management, Team & Task Management, AR Intelligence, Electronic Invoicing & Payments, Intercompany Create, Intercompany Balance & Resolve, and Intercompany Net & Settle. These applications address many use cases across our customers’ financial operations and include comprehensive and flexible solutions that deliver best practices for end-to-end record-to-report and invoice-to-cash processes. 
Our Growth Strategy
Our principal growth strategies include the following:
Continue to Innovate and Expand our Solutions. 
Our ability to internally develop or make strategic acquisitions of new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success. We intend to deepen our existing capabilities and extend the functionality and range of our applications to bring new solutions to the Office of the CFO.
Enhance our Leadership Position within the Marketplace.

We intend to focus on customer expansion, geography, and industry to maintain and grow our leadership position.
•
Customer Expansion:
 We believe we have a leading position in the market with both enterprise and select mid-size companies. We intend to leverage our brand recognition, history of innovation, and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market businesses. We pursue a land-and-expand sales model and believe there is significant opportunity to increase sales of our solutions within our existing customer base. Our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers’ usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships.
•

4
Cloud
 Marketplaces. 
We have established the ability to buy BlackLine solutions via Cloud Marketplaces by Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), and Amazon AWS (“AWS”). This enables our customers to leverage their committed spend with those cloud providers for a software purchase with BlackLine.
BlackLine Platform, Products, and Capabilities
We provide a unified, scalable, and flexible platform tailored to the evolving needs of the Office of the CFO and deliver purpose-built applications that address critical processes, including financial close & consolidation, intercompany accounting, and invoice-to-cash. Our software and services provide the critical technology and industry-leading practices that deliver accurate, efficient, and intelligent financial operations. 
BlackLine Studio360 Platform
In today’s dynamic business environment, the Office of the CFO faces unprecedented challenges: managing complex systems, siloed data, and demands for real-time, accurate insights to enable strategic decision-making. Traditional, fragmented solutions cannot keep up with the increasing complexity of data, systems, and processes. The need for a unified, comprehensive, flexible, and scalable platform has never been greater.

Solutions
Our cloud-based solutions for the Office of the CFO are designed to be the primary system of interaction for accounting and finance professionals. Our solutions unify systems and data and work to drive accuracy, collaboration, efficiency, and control. Our solutions enable accounting and finance professionals to execute their work continuously, empowering real-time insights and business partnership. 
Products and Services
Our products are comprised of financial close & consolidation, intercompany accounting, and invoice-to-cash. We also provide resources and services for implementation. 
Financial Close & Consolidation 
The collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate, and report their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as record-to-report. For organizations of any size, traditional processes are heavily manual and rely upon error-prone spreadsheets, increasing risk and threatening the accuracy of financial reporting. Our Financial Close & Consolidation solutions allow customers to standardize and automate key steps across the record-to-report process to ensure accuracy and control. Our products include: 
•
Account Reconciliations
 provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to substantiate their balance sheet by completing account reconciliations. Features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. The product automates otherwise manual activities in the substantiation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. It also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process;
5
•
Transaction Matching
 analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. Our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within large data sets. The matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data, and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real time;
•
Journal Entry 
allows users to generate, review, and post manual journal entries. Many postings can be fully automated and calculated based on complex, customer-defined logic or automatically allocated across multiple business units. Validation and approval checkpoints help ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications, including hundreds of ERPs and subsystems, in a configurable, standardized format;
•
Task Management
 enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. The solution provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow, and provides a management console for accounting and finance activities. Though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys. The solution can be used as a cloud-based, controlled checklist that includes reporting and alerts to drive greater collaboration, accountability, and visibility;
•
Smart Close for SAP

is a fully embedded, purpose-built solution to streamline and automate the close directly in SAP. Smart Close complements our cloud financial close management solutions to achieve end-to-end automation. Purpose-built automation allows customers to automate task and job scheduling, verify the correctness of closing transactions, and take action, like raising alerts, making corrections, or pushing the closing process to the next step with job scheduling;
•
Financial Reporting Analytics 
is a modern solution that enables analysis and validation of group level or consolidated financial data with direct, real-time visibility into the local or underlying details. The solution provides a centralized workspace with end-to-end transparency and automates ledger-to-ledger, statutory-to-GAAP, tax-to-GAAP, and system-to-system reconciliation to ensure the completeness and accuracy of consolidated fluctuation results;
•
Variance Analysis
 automatically calculates, identifies, and provides anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances with “always-on” monitoring. Once an item needing investigation is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation. Users can then document and sign off on explanations, enabling stronger control; and 
•
Compliance
 is an integrated solution that facilitates compliance-related initiatives, consolidates project management, and provides visibility over control self-assessments and testing. 
Intercompany 
Intercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. These transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty and process inefficiency for the controller organization, frequently causing imbalances that must be resolved. The intricate nature of intercompany transactions often drives accounting operations to process a substantial volume of intercompany charges within the constraints of the fiscal calendar, leaving insufficient time for enhancing the quality of the underlying data. This prevalent operational practice results in heightened stress for accounting and finance professionals, originating from an unproductive and avoidable workload. Often manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive processes, intercompany transactions can have material impacts on costs if not managed properly. Our intercompany solutions manage the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform, from the initial creation of a transaction through the settlement. We believe it is the only widely-available, automated end-to-end intercompany solution maintained in a single platform. These solutions include: 
•
Intercompany Create 
increases visibility into transaction-level data by originating transactions directly within our software. Intercompany transactions are configured and executed with a simple process that uses billing routes to facilitate the flow of a transaction and the appropriate tax and transfer pricing mark-ups. The application stores permissions and business logic exceptions by entity, service, and transaction type, ensuring that both the seller and the buyer of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business, while billing in a manner that optimizes process efficiency and minimizes tax leakage. Transactions are booked via Journals directly into the ledger. Invoices are automatically generated for each respective jurisdiction and e-invoicing capabilities can send intercompany data to country-specific portals. Workflow capabilities exist for ad hoc transactions as well as non-invoiceable transactions;
6
•
Intercompany Balance & Resolve
 centralizes, streamlines, and automates intercompany reconciliation complexity and dispute management by capturing all intercompany transactions within the virtual subledger and providing resolution actions to reconcile. This feature reduces intercompany reconciliation risk, effort, and last-minute plugs by automatically flagging out-of-balance trading pairs and underlying transactions that create exceptions on a continuous basis. Open intercompany transactions are continuously analyzed to verify offsetting transactions on the respective trading partner books. Exceptions are flagged and users are automatically notified for investigation and resolution. Automated or workflow-based resolution actions and adjustments bring the balance back into line for settlement-ready balances; and
•
Intercompany Net and Settle
 enables real-time visibility into open intercompany transactions that integrate with treasury systems to facilitate and streamline netting, settlement, and clearing to optimize working capital. Using bilateral and multilateral netting to reduce the number of transactions that typically incur bank fees, treasury teams can effectively manage the manner that intercompany balances are closed out using cash and non-cash settlement methodologies to effectively manage the cash positions of each entity. Users can filter the information by transaction type, hold type, currency, or business relationship. This feature facilitates the process of netting transactions and helps users make informed, strategic decisions, while managing cash reporting and forecasting.
Invoice-to-Cash
Cash is vital to every business, and invoice-to-cash is central to improving cash flow. Managing invoice-to-cash well means maximizing working capital by collecting cash and minimizing credit losses. This critical process is often highly manual. Our unified suite helps customers collect cash, provide credit, and better understand cash flow.
•
Cash Application
 transforms the order-to-cash cycle by significantly reducing the time it takes to apply cash receipts to open invoices, resulting in significant reductions in unapplied cash. BlackLine Cash Application drives an automated and effective end-to-end process from an invoice-to-cash in the bank and fully applied in the subledger. It uses intelligent automation to help customers accurately apply payments to customers’ invoices in an ERP. Embedded machine learning then reduces the manual effort involved in the process and releases working capital for our customers;
•
Credit & Risk Management
 brings customer and payment behavior data together to enable optimal risk strategies and real-time risk profiling. Managing the balance between sales and risk of non-payment is critical to profitability. Credit & Risk Management brings together data from numerous sources, such as credit reference agencies, credit insurers, and payment performance to understand historical indebtedness and behavior trends of the companies with whom our customers work. This solution works in tandem with our Collections Management solution to help organizations better understand their customer base and make informed decisions around collection strategies, recovery sequences, and the prioritization of team tasks;
•
Collections Management
 helps customers design collection strategies to fit each of their customer’s sales ledger profile. Releasing cash from customers is the fastest way to increase working capital. Collections Management streamlines the collections process and unlocks more cash from companies with automated escalating recovery sequences that enable collections teams to better prioritize their work by understanding which customers require attention. Customers gain real-time clarity into what actions and collection strategies are working at each stage of the collection process and can use this information to collect payments more efficiently, leading to reduced days sales outstanding and improved customer relationships;
•
Disputes & Deductions Management
 helps our customers track payment disputes to drive prompt response and resolution. Unresolved disputes lead to uncollected revenue and can threaten profitability. Disputes & Deductions logs, monitors, and analyzes invoice disputes and provides our customers automated workflows to accelerate dispute resolution and protect their customer relationships;
•
Team & Task Management
 automates accounts receivable teams’ tasks while ensuring timely execution by using data to drive priority of actions. The historically manual work behind accounts receivable processes can lead to siloed work and a lack of end-to-end visibility. Team & Task Management provides full visibility into the accounts receivable process, monitors critical actions against the volume of work, and allocates resources based on team capacity to prioritize risk management and cash collection; 
•
AR Intelligence
 automatically processes, analyzes, and surfaces critical information, such as sales and payment performance data, customer payment trends, and days sales outstanding. This solution unifies the data across BlackLine’s Invoice-to-Cash suite to provide data typically difficult to obtain in real-time; 
7
Customers using this solution gain insights into customer behavior, as well as the ability to measure the impact of extended payment terms to cash collections and cash flow, and understand the predictability of customer payments when building cash flow forecasts; and
•
Electronic Invoicing & Payments
 helps our customers generate, send, and monitor invoices in diverse e-invoice formats through a multitude of delivery channels. Customers can download invoices through secure, branded, customer invoice portals. BlackLine’s Electronic Invoicing & Compliance can provide financial flexibility with the ability to service inbound customer payments through a range of versatile payment channels. BlackLine Invoicing & Compliance allows customers to adapt and adhere to country-specific requirements with evolving e-invoicing regulations across various countries.
Services
Customer service is essential to our customers' success and we are focused on driving long-term partnership and value by offering the following services:
•
Implementation: 
With a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. A typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer’s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. For customers that elect to work with a partner or business process outsourcer for implementation services, BlackLine provides partner training and certification, as well as support for partner-led projects;
•
Optimization:

Our transformation team assists with optimization strategies for transformation projects through the BlackLine Optimization Academy where we teach accountants how to optimize their accounting and reporting processes. Customers learn what processes can benefit from optimization and can choose to undertake the optimization process themselves or choose our consulting services or strategic customer advisory services to continue their journey;
•
Training & Education:
 We offer a variety of live and web-based training options through BlackLine University. Many customers consume their training through our e-learning environment, while others select both live and e-learning. Courses cover solutions functionality, as well as the underlying concepts and demonstrate the power of our platform like financial close & consolidation, intercompany accounting, and invoice-to-cash;
•
Customer Success:
 Our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and create a success plan for expanded usage of our platform for process optimization. A success plan is central to increased customer value and customer adoption. This approach positively impacts our retention and upsell efforts; and
•
Global Support:

From our offices in Australia, Canada, England, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and the U.S., we provide tiered customer support, ranging from support provided during business hours to 24/7/365 support. All customers have access to essential support through our support and community portal, included as part of their subscription. In 2023, we rolled out two additional tiers of support that customers can purchase based on their needs.
Across our platform, products and services, BlackLine stands out through its integration, scalability and flexibility, ease of use, and commitment to innovation. Our solutions securely and automatically connect with ERPs and various financial data sources, simplifying data consolidation for complex environments. Unlike solutions tied to specific systems, BlackLine is ERP and data source agnostic, ensuring compatibility and adaptability as organizations evolve. Designed by finance and accounting professionals with years of industry experience, our user-friendly interface offers intuitive dashboards, collaboration tools, and streamlined workflows for all skill levels. With a history of proven innovation and a commitment to continued investment, BlackLine continues to address more challenges across the Office of the CFO, meeting the diverse and dynamic needs of today’s businesses.

Our future-ready platform enables financial operations excellence and empowers the Office of the CFO to deliver strategic value to their organizations. 
Customers
Our customers include multinational corporations, large enterprises, and mid-size companies across a broad array of industries. These businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. At December 31, 2024, we had 397,477 individual users across 4,443 customers, exclusive of on-premise software. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force leverages our relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and Microsoft, professional services firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, and Ernst & Young and business process outsourcers, such as CapGemini, Genpact, and RSM, to influence and drive customer growth. Since 2018, we have partnered with SAP, incorporating them into the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions as SAP solutions-extensions (“SolEx”), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. SolEx allows us to provide the highest level integration with SAP ERP solutions. Going forward, we intend to become a more partner-powered organization, harnessing the deep and embedded relationships our partners have with key decision-makers at our customers.
Our marketing efforts are focused on demand generation, establishing and extending our brand proposition, generating product awareness, and cultivating our community of users. We generate demand primarily through word-of-mouth, search engine marketing, campaigns and events, and our network of business process outsourcers, business services organizations and resellers. We leverage online and offline marketing channels on a global basis, organize customer roundtables and user conferences, and release white papers, case studies, blogs, and other resources. We execute co-marketing activities with partners such as SAP, Ernst & Young, and Deloitte. We further extend our brand awareness through sponsorships with leading industry organizations such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, the Institute of Management Accountants, or IMA, the Financial Executives International, or FEI, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, or ICAEW, and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, or ACCA. 
Competition
The market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires a deep understanding of the industry standards, financial operations processes, accounting rules, and global financial regulations.
9
We compete with vendors of financial operations, financial automation, record-to-report, and invoice-to-cash software, including software offered by certain ERP vendors. Further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•
depth and breadth of solutions;
•
level of customer satisfaction;
•
ease of deployment and use of applications;
•
ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
•
domain expertise on accounting and finance best practices;
•
ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
•
capability for configurability, integration, and scalability of applications;
•
cloud-based delivery model;
•
advanced security and reliability features;
•
brand recognition and historical operating performance; and
•
price and total cost of ownership.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have two patents. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer, or otherwise obtain portions of our software. Competitors may attempt to develop similar solutions that could compete in the same market as our solutions. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the U.S. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we continue to expand outside of the U.S.
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments.
