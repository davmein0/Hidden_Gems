Executive Overview

MarketAxess operates leading electronic trading platforms delivering greater trading efficiency, a diversified pool of liquidity and significant cost savings to our clients across the global fixed-income markets. Approximately 2,100 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms use our patented trading technology to efficiently trade U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds and other fixed-income securities. We leverage our diverse set of trading protocols, automated and algorithmic trading solutions, intelligent data and index products and a range of post-trade services to provide an end-to-end trading solution to our robust network of platform participants. Our award-winning Open Trading marketplace is widely regarded as the preferred all-to-all trading solution in the global credit markets, creating a unique liquidity pool for a broad range of credit market participants.

We provide automated and algorithmic trading solutions that we believe, when combined with our integrated and actionable data offerings, help our clients make faster, better-informed decisions on when and how to trade on our platforms. In 2024, we continued our roll-out of X-Pro, our newest trading platform, to more seamlessly combine our trading protocols with our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. Our AI-driven technology, such as CP+, our real-time pricing engine, is a critical data input and pricing source for multiple MarketAxess trading protocols and solutions, including Auto-X™ and portfolio trading. In 2024, we leveraged our recent acquisition of Pragma, a quantitative trading technology provider specializing in algorithmic and analytical trading services, to accelerate our development of AI driven execution algorithms across all of our key product areas. We believe that we will be able to enhance our capabilities and increase our efficiency by leveraging Pragma technology across our technology stack.

We also provide a number of integrated and actionable data offerings, including CP+ and Axess All, to assist clients with real-time pricing and trading decisions and transaction cost analysis. We offer a range of post-trade services, including straight-through processing, post-trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across fixed-income and other products.

We operate in a large and growing market that provides us with a significant opportunity for future growth, due, in part, to the relatively low levels of electronic trading in many of our largest current product areas. We offer Open Trading for most of our products in order to capitalize on this addressable market by increasing the number of potential trading counterparties and providing our clients with a menu of solutions at each step in the trading process. We believe that Open Trading drives meaningful price improvement for our clients and reduces risk in fixed-income markets by creating a global, diversified pool of liquidity whereby our institutional investor, dealer and alternative liquidity provider clients can all interact on an anonymous basis. Institutional investors can also send trading inquiries directly to their traditional broker-dealer counterparties on a disclosed basis, while simultaneously accessing additional counterparties through our anonymous Open Trading solutions.

We derive revenue from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms, information services, post-trade services and technology services. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and general and administrative expenses.

Our objective is to provide the leading global network for the trading of fixed-income securities for our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to help them connect, be more efficient and achieve better trading outcomes. We seek to achieve this goal by offering our clients full end-to-end electronic trading solutions and workflow tools, powered by a broad array of proprietary data and analytical tools. The key elements of our strategy are discussed in Part I, Item 1. “Business – Our Strategy.”

Critical Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company

Economic, Political and Market Factors

The global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may impact trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include, among others, fixed-income market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates, the duration of bonds traded, economic and political conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.

In 2024, the market backdrop for the Company showed strong increases in estimated U.S. credit market volumes, with U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield market average daily trading volume up 25.3% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to the prior year. However, credit spreads and credit spread volatility remained at historically low levels. A strong new issue calendar, which we have seen in recent periods, and low levels of credit spread volatility can contribute to a decrease in exchange-trade fund (“ETF”) market maker activity on our platforms, as the increased availability of new issues may lead to reduction in secondary market trading, especially in U.S. high-yield. A strong new issue calendar can also negatively impact our market share in the short-term, but is expected to positively impact secondary trading volumes over the long-term. The decrease in U.S. high-yield activity during the year negatively impacted our total credit average variable fee per million, but the increase in higher duration bonds traded in U.S. high-grade positively impacted our total credit average variable fee per million.

With regard to the international products traded on our platforms, Eurobonds and emerging markets estimated market volumes increased significantly compared to the prior year. The increase in emerging markets estimated market volumes was driven by a more favorable macroeconomic outlook in developed markets, reflecting easing concerns over inflation and the lower probability of an economic recession.

Because the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation impacts our expenses, such as employee compensation, technology and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. Interest rates are currently higher than recent periods due to a period of increased inflation. To the extent interest rates remain high or inflation has other adverse effects on the securities markets or the economy, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We expect that current cash and investment balances, in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under our Credit Agreement (as defined below), will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We ended the year with $749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and capital significantly in excess of our regulatory requirements.

Competitive Landscape

The global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage, in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer or all-to-all trading platforms. Competitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us.

We primarily compete on the basis of our client network, the liquidity provided by our dealer, and, to a lesser extent, institutional investor clients, the total transaction costs and fees associated with our services, the breadth of products, protocols and services offered, as well as the quality, reliability, security and ease of use of our platforms. We believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.

There has been increased demand for portfolio trading workflows over the last few years, which has resulted in heightened competition among trading platforms to enhance their portfolio trading offerings and expand them across different geographies and products. During periods of relatively lower credit spread volatility, clients have been using portfolio trading workflows in lieu of more established trading protocols designed to generate price competition on individual bonds. Our dealer clients have also increased their usage of matching sessions offered by competing platforms in recent periods. To the extent that our clients increase their use of portfolio trading and matching session protocols offered by other platforms, our market share in those products could decrease. Due to the large size of the trades and the concentration of activity at the end of the month, portfolio trading can drive significant swings in trading volumes and estimated market share.

Our competitive position is enhanced by the unique liquidity provided by our Open Trading functionalities and the integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the fixed-income markets we serve in the development of our platforms, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.

46

Regulatory Environment

Our business is subject to extensive regulations in the United States and internationally, which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance. The existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended, resulting in the enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business. In January 2022, the SEC proposed rules that will expand Regulation ATS and Regulation SCI to alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities and amend the SEC rule regarding the definition of an “exchange” to include Communication Protocol Systems, such as our request-for-quote protocols. Based on these proposed rules, we expect that we will have to operate additional trading protocols in compliance with Regulation ATS and we could become subject to Regulation SCI for certain parts of our business in the future.  The SEC also recently adopted final rules regarding the central clearing of certain secondary market transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities, which are currently set to become effective for certain cash market transactions on December 31, 2025 and repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on June 30, 2026. Once effective, this central clearing mandate will impact certain of our participants who do not centrally clear such trades today, and some of our investor clients have expressed concerns about using platforms that will require the clearing of any resultant trades executed on such platforms. While we expect this change will increase our own platform efficiency, it is still unknown at this time the full impact of this change, and what effect it will have, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us. In addition, following the change in U.S. presidential administrations, it is unknown to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted, abandoned or modified, or what effect such passage, adoption, abandonment or modification will have, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us.

We provide regulated services to our clients within the E.U. in reliance upon the authorizations our subsidiaries have received from the AFM in the Netherlands. Brexit has led to an ongoing divergence between the U.K. and E.U. financial regulations, which has made it more difficult and costly to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject. The cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes has increased and is likely to continue to increase in the future.

Compliance with new regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources, which may adversely affect our profitability. For example, DORA, which focuses on the security of network and information systems of financial services entities, as well as third parties which provide certain ICTs to them, became applicable to portions of our business in January 2025. DORA has, among other things, introduced significant additional ICT-related governance, risk management, resilience testing and sub-contracting and notification requirements. However, we also believe new regulations may increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic trading platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements.

For further description of the regulations which govern our business, see Part I, Item 1. “Business—Government Regulation.”

Technology Environment

We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms. The markets in which we compete are characterized by increasingly complex protocols, systems,  technology and  infrastructure requirements that require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices, including cloud and AI technologies, on a cost-effective and timely basis. For example, in 2023, we introduced MarketAxess X-Pro, our new trading platform, which provides traders with a flexible user experience, intuitive workflows and access to our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. In addition, as the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit products, we are experiencing continued demand for, and growth in, our automated and algorithmic trading solutions. We also support a large and growing base of dealer market making algorithms. We plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure and automation initiatives to support more efficient trade execution by our clients.

We experience cybersecurity threats and incidents from time to time. However, as of the date of this report, MarketAxess has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected the Company in at least the past three years. Cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs. We therefore continue to make investments in our cybersecurity infrastructure and training of employees, which may result in increased costs, to strengthen our cybersecurity measures.

Trends in Our Business

The majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. We believe that the following are the key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms, the amount of commissions earned by us and our variable transaction fees per million:

•
the number of participants on our platforms and their willingness to use our platforms instead of competitors’ platforms or other execution methods; 

•
the particular trading protocol that our participants use to trade bonds on our platforms; 

•
the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses by participants on our platforms; 

•
the number of markets that are available for our participants to trade on our platforms; 

•
the overall level of activity in these markets; 

•
the duration of the bonds trading on our platforms, which may be affected by inflation, among other macroeconomic factors; and

•
the particular fee plan under which we earn commissions.

We believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability.

As further described under “— Critical Factors Affecting our Industry and our Company — Economic, Political and Market Factors” and “— Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023”, in 2024, our trading volumes increased and our average variable transaction fee per million decreased.

Components of Our Results of Operations

Commission Revenue

Commissions are recognized on a trade date basis, are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions.

For Open Trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades. For the majority of U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.

Credit Commissions. 
Credit includes U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and leveraged loans. Our U.S. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. Certain broker-dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. Under these fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer client. The U.S. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded.

Commissions for high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and leveraged loans generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules. Our high-yield fee plan structure is similar to our U.S. high-grade fee plans. Certain dealers participate in a high-yield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and a fixed distribution fee, while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments.

The average credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of high-grade bonds traded on our platforms and changes in product mix or trading protocols.

Credit distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans.

Rates Commissions. 
Rates includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and European government bonds. Commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded. U.S. Treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol. The average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols.

We anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.

48

Other Commissions. 
Other commissions include equities and foreign exchange commissions for Pragma’s algorithmic trading services. Commissions for equities and foreign exchange are volume-tiered and consist of variable transaction fees that are billed monthly.

Information Services

We generate revenue from data licensed to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. These revenues are either for subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.

Post-trade Services

We generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and post-trade matching services. Customers are generally billed in the current month or monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed. Revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. We also generate one-time implementation fees for onboarding clients, which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete.

Technology Services

Technology services include technology services revenue generated by Pragma and revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients.

Expenses

In the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses:

Employee Compensation and Benefits.
 Employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based compensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.

Depreciation and Amortization. 
We depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to five years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 15 years, using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit that we expect to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment.

Technology and Communications.
 Technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to software and licenses, maintenance on software and hardware, cloud hosting costs, data feeds provided by outside vendors, U.S. government bonds technology platform licensing fees, data center hosting costs and our internal network connections. The majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. We charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur.

Professional and Consulting Fees.
 Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platforms, information and post-trade services products and other services.

Occupancy. 
Occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.

Marketing and Advertising.
 Marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of branding and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services. This expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platforms, information services and post-trade services.

Clearing Costs.
 Clearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by third-party clearing brokers and depositories for the clearing and settlement of matched principal trades, regulatory reporting fees and variable transaction fees assessed by the provider of our third-party middle office system.

General and Administrative.
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, board of directors’ expenses, regulatory fees, subscription costs, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, various state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.

49

Expenses may continue to grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits as we increase headcount to support investment in new products, operational support and geographic expansion, depreciation and amortization due to increased investment in new products and enhancements to our trading platforms, and technology and communication costs. Expenses may also grow due to increased regulatory complexity, acquisitions or the continued effects of inflation.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest Income
. Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, deposits and investments.

Interest Expense. 
Interest expense consists of financing charges incurred on short-term borrowings.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate represents the proportionate share of our equity method investee’s net income.

Other, Net. 
Other, net consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading security investments and foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, investment advisory fees, credit facility administrative fees, gains or losses on revaluations of contingent consideration payable and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.

Critical Accounting Estimates

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting estimates for us include stock-based compensation.

Stock-based compensation

We maintain the MarketAxess Holdings Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) which provides for the grant of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units (collectively, “Full Value Awards”), stock options and other stock-based awards to encourage employees, consultants and non-employee directors to participate in our long-term success. We make critical accounting estimates related to performance stock units granted under the 2020 Plan (the “PSUs”).

In 2022, 2023 and 2024, the PSUs were granted to the executive officers and certain senior managers. Each PSU is earned or forfeited based on our level of achievement of certain predetermined metrics, including pre-tax adjusted operating margin, U.S. credit market share and revenue growth excluding U.S. credit. The vested share payout ranges from zero to 200% of the PSU target. The number of PSUs that vest, if any, is determined by the level of achievement of the performance metrics during the three-year performance periods, as certified by the Compensation and Talent Committee following the conclusion of the performance period. In addition, participants must provide continued service through the vesting date, subject to death, disability and qualified retirement exceptions, as applicable. Compensation expense for the PSUs is measured using the fair value of our stock at the grant date and estimates of future performance and actual share payouts. Each period, we make estimates of the current expected share payouts and adjust the life-to-date compensation expense recognized since the grant date. As of December 31, 2024, a 10.0% change in the expected final share payouts would increase or decrease the life-to-date compensation expense by $1.5 million. The estimated final share payouts for the 2022 and 2023 awards as of December 31, 2024 decreased 26.6% compared to December 31, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 for a discussion of any recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Results

We provide end-to-end trading solutions, including the operation of electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income and other securities and related data, analytics, compliance tools, post-trade services, automated trading services and technology services. We consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these products and services within the trading lifecycle, the use of a single inter-connected suite of technology solutions underlying all services, the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain geographic information about our business required by GAAP.

Credit variable transaction fees increased by $37.3 million, driven by a 13.5% increase in trading volume, partially offset by a 5.3% decrease in total credit average variable transaction fee per million. Open Trading credit volume totaled $1.0 trillion during the year ended December 31, 2024, up 8.7% from the year ended December 31, 2023, and Open Trading credit variable transaction fees represented 33.0% and 35.6% of total credit variable transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rates variable transaction fees increased by $4.4 million, driven principally by a 23.3% increase in trading volumes, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in average variable transaction fee per million. Other variable transaction fees include equities and foreign exchange commissions earned by Pragma.

Credit fixed distribution fees decreased $7.8 million mainly due to migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.

For volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars at average monthly rates.

The 17.4% increase in our U.S. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in estimated market volumes, partially offset by a decrease in our estimated market share. Estimated U.S. high-grade market volume as reported by TRACE increased by 25.9% to $9.0 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume decreased to 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. U.S. high-yield volume decreased by 15.9% primarily due to a decrease in our estimated market share. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-yield corporate bond volume decreased to 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Emerging markets and Eurobond volumes increased by 19.7% and 15.2%, respectively, mainly due to an increase in estimated market volumes. Other credit volumes increased 20.9%, mainly due to an increase in our estimated municipal bond market share. Rates trading volume increased 23.3%, primarily due to an increase in estimated market volumes.

Credit average variable transaction fee per million decreased by 5.3% to $150.26 per million for the year ended December 31, 2024, mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift reflecting lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading, which was partially offset by an increase in the duration of U.S. high-grade bonds traded on our platforms.

Information Services
. Information services revenue increased by $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, mainly due to net new data contract revenue of $3.3 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $0.8 million.

Post-Trade Services
. Post-trade services revenue increased by $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, principally due to net new contract revenue of $1.6 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $0.7 million.

Technology Services
. Technology services revenue increased by $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the inclusion of a full-year of technology services revenue generated by Pragma.

Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 include a full year of Pragma expenses of $32.0 million, while total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 include three months of Pragma expenses of $8.7 million.

Employee compensation and benefits increased by $29.0 million, primarily due to an increase in salaries, taxes and benefits of $20.2 million on higher employee headcount, largely driven by the Pragma Acquisition (as defined below), higher employee incentive compensation of $7.6 million and higher stock compensation expense of $1.2 million.

Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.3 million primarily due to higher amortization of software development costs of $2.6 million and higher amortization of intangibles of $1.2 million, offset by lower depreciation of office hardware of $0.8 million.

Technology and communications expenses increased by $9.4 million, primarily due to higher software subscription costs of $3.1 million, higher integration and connectivity costs of $3.2 million, higher market data costs of $1.0 million, higher data center and cloud hosting costs of $1.2 million and higher U.S. Treasury platform licensing fees of $0.8 million.

Professional and consulting fees decreased by $4.6 million primarily due to lower IT consulting costs of $2.6 million, lower acquisition-related legal expenses of $1.4 million and lower other consulting expenses of $1.3 million, offset by higher audit and tax costs of $0.9 million.

Other, net decreased by $2.7 million principally driven by unrealized losses of $1.0 million on our U.S. Treasury investments in the current period compared to unrealized gains of $0.5 million in the prior period and higher credit facility fees of $0.9 million.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 included benefits of $1.9 million for return-to-provision adjustments, $0.6 million for the settlement of tax liability, interest and penalties in connection with unrecognized tax benefits and $2.0 million for the purchase of renewable energy-related transferable tax credits. In comparison, the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included benefits of $5.4 million for return-to-provision adjustments, $2.0 million for the settlement of tax liability, interest and penalties in connection with unrecognized tax benefits and $1.5 million for the purchase of renewable energy-related transferable tax credits. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on the geographic mix of our earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates and the amount and timing of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments, among other factors.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand, internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate bond and U.S. Treasury investments totaled $698.6 million as of December 31, 2024. Our investments generally consist of investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes.

In August 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides aggregate commitments totaling $750.0 million, including a revolving credit facility, a $5.0 million letter of credit sub-limit for standby letters of credit and a $380.0 million sub-limit for swingline loans. The Credit Agreement will mature on August 9, 2026, with our option to request up to two additional 364-day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions. As of December 31, 2024, we had $0.1 million in letters of credit outstanding and $749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an alternate base rate or the adjusted term SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin that varies with our consolidated total leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy certain covenants, including a requirement to not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2024. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Credit Agreement.

In connection with their self-clearing operations, certain of our operating subsidiaries maintain agreements with a settlement bank to allow the subsidiaries to borrow an aggregate of up to $500.0 million on an uncommitted basis, collateralized by eligible securities pledged by the subsidiaries to the settlement bank, subject to certain haircuts. Borrowings under these agreements will bear interest at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the upper range of the Federal Funds Rate, 0.25% or one-month SOFR, plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2024, the subsidiaries had no borrowings outstanding and up to $500.0 million in available uncommitted borrowing capacity under such agreements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.

Under arrangements with their settlement banks, certain of our operating subsidiaries may receive overnight financing in the form of bank overdrafts. As of December 31, 2024, we had no overdrafts payable outstanding.

As a result of our self-clearing and settlement activities, we are required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the positions financed, restricted cash deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our self-clearing and settlement activities was $189.6 million. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources.

Cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items that primarily include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, deferred tax expense and changes in receivables and payables on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The $51.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and favorable changes in accounts receivable, prepaid and other assets, trading investments, accrued employee compensation and accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by higher net receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers associated with our clearing activities.

The $68.4 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower cash used for acquisitions of $78.5 million, offset by higher net purchases of available-for-sale investments of $6.0 million and higher capital expenditures of $4.1 million.

The $54.3 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to higher repurchases of common stock of $75.5 million and higher cash dividends of $3.0 million, offset by lower payments of contingent consideration of $12.5 million, higher exercises of stock options of $2.0 million and lower withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting of $9.6 million.

The $15.8 million change in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was driven by changes in the cumulative translation adjustment which reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound and Euro in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. A decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business and financial condition.

Other Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, in the short-term (during the next 12 months). However, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including liquidity requirements associated with our self-clearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue streams. We may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our business. In the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business. In addition, in the long-term (beyond 12 months), we believe our liquidity needs and requirements will be affected by the factors discussed above.

Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers and are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the CFTC. These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the FCA in the U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of December 31, 2024, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $574.6 million in excess of the required levels of $33.8 million.

Each of our U.S. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally limit, or require the prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator before, the repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources.

56

We execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing models, we may be exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of our trades. We did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Substantially all of our open securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive transactions as of December 31, 2024 have subsequently settled at the contractual amounts.

 In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. Our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred.

We have leases for corporate offices and equipment with initial lease terms ranging from one year to 15 years. We have total future contractual rent payments on these leases of $94.1 million, with $12.8 million due within the next 12 months and $81.3 million due beyond 12 months.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses. As of December 31, 2024, the notional value of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding was $64.5 million and the fair value of the liability was $0.9 million.

In January 2022, our Board authorized the 2022 Repurchase Program for up to $150.0 million. In August 2024, our Board authorized the 2024 Repurchase Program for up to an additional $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $225.0 million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Programs. As of January 31, 2025, we had $220.0 million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Programs. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs will be held in treasury for future use.

In January 2025, our Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share payable on March 5, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2025. Any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board.

See Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy.

On April 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 49.0% interest in RFQ–hub Holdings LLC for approximately $37.9 million of cash consideration. The acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon the closing of the acquisition, we will hold a 92.0% controlling stake in RFQ-hub Holdings LLC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding our operating results. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding our operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Market Risk

The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $99.0 million of investments in U.S. Treasuries that were classified as trading securities and $55.1 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as available-for-sale. Adverse movements, such as a decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities, could result in a substantial loss. A 10.0% decrease in the market value of our U.S Treasuries or available-for-sale investments would result in losses of approximately $9.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period.

See also Part I, Item 1A
.
– “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Global Economic and Market Conditions – Global economic, political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services, and our profitability and business could suffer.”

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and deposits. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and deposits amounted to $700.5 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income by approximately $7.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and deposits.

As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately $1.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments. The hypothetical unrealized gain or loss of $1.0 million would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

A similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately $2.2 million. The hypothetical unrealized gain or loss of $2.2 million would be recognized in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct operations in several different countries outside of the U.S., most notably the U.K., and substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating expenses, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 15.8% of our revenue and 24.5% of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, most notably the British Pound Sterling. Based on actual results over the past year, a hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately $12.9 million and operating expenses by approximately $11.7 million.

59

Credit Risk

Through certain of our subsidiaries, we execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.

We are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform, including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk. In connection with Open Trading or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase.

We have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk. There can be no assurance that these policies, procedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed-income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third-party sources. Such information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks. Given this concentration, we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks.

Derivative Risk

Our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to economically hedge our foreign exchange gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations that arise from our U.S. dollar versus British Pound Sterling exposure from the activities of our U.K. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was $64.5 million. We do not hold derivative instruments for purposes other than economically hedging foreign currency risk.

ANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
.

Based on its assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024
 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
 (PCAOB ID 
238
), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of MarketAxess Holdings Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

63

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Open Trading Commissions

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company executes trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller (“Open Trading”). Open Trading variable transaction fees, which represent commissions for matched principal trades, were $178.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Variable transaction fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type, size, yield, maturity of the bond traded, and individual client incentives. For Open Trading trades, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. As disclosed by management, commissions are determined based on the fee schedule associated with the instrument being traded.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for Open Trading commissions is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to this revenue type, which is calculated based on the instrument being traded, volume of the instrument being traded, and individual client incentives.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness and accuracy of Open Trading commissions. These procedures also included, among others, testing a sample of Open Trading transactions by (i) agreeing the details of the trade to underlying documentation, (ii) agreeing fees charged to the fee schedule based on the trade details, and as applicable, any individual client incentives, and (iii) recalculating the Open Trading commission variable transaction fee.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company defines cash equivalents as short-term interest-bearing investments with maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.

Investments
The Company determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase which are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on the trade date. Securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and realized gains or losses reported in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Trading investments include U.S. Treasuries and are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains or losses included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company assesses whether an impairment loss on its available-for-sale debt securities has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. When the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale debt security exceeds its fair value, the security is deemed to be impaired. The portion of an impairment related to credit losses is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security
 and is recorded as a charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remainder of an impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss if the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
Fair Value Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” A three-tiered hierarchy for determining fair value has been established that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets), Level 2 (inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified in Level 1) and Level 3 (inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace). The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of its money market funds, trading securities, available-for-sale securities and foreign currency forward contracts. All other financial instruments are short-term in nature and the carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition approximate fair value.

71

MARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Receivables from and Payables to Broker-dealers, Clearing Organizations and Customers
Receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts receivable for securities not delivered by the Company to the purchaser by the settlement date (“securities failed-to-deliver”) and cash deposits held at clearing organizations and clearing brokers to facilitate the settlement and clearance of matched principal transactions. Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts payable for securities not received by the Company from a seller by the settlement date (“securities failed-to-receive”). Securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive for transactions executed on a matched principal basis where the Company serves as a counterparty to both the buyer and the seller are recorded on a settlement date basis. The Company presents its securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive balances on a net-by-counterparty basis within receivables from and payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers. The difference between the Company’s trade-date receivables and payables for unsettled matched principal transactions reflects commissions earned and is recorded within accounts receivable, net on a trade date basis.
Allowance for Credit Losses

All accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than 
one year
 and are derived from trading-related fees and commissions and revenues from products and services. The Company continually monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for credit losses is based on the estimated expected credit losses in accounts receivable, as determined from a review of aging schedules, past due balances, historical collection experience and other specific collection issues that have been identified. Account balances are grouped for evaluation based on various risk characteristics, including billing type, legal entity, and geographic region. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Balances that are determined to be uncollectable are written off against the allowance for credit losses.

The allowance for credit losses was $
1.0
 million and $
0.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. The provision for bad debts was $
0.8
 million, $
0.4
 million and $
0.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Write-offs and other charges against the allowance for credit losses were $
0.4
 million, $
0.3
 million and $
0.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization

Fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over 
three
 to 
seven years
. The Company amortizes leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development of internal use software, including, among other items, employee compensation and related benefits and third-party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. Once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
three
 to 
five years
. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.

Cloud Computing Costs 
The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with cloud computing arrangements, including, among other items, vendor software development costs billed to us that are part of the application development stage. These costs are recorded as a prepaid asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and are amortized over the period of the hosting service contract, which ranges from 
one
 to 
five years
. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
Foreign Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates at the end of the period; revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

72

MARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge its foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these forward contracts are included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company records the fair value of the forward contract asset in prepaid expenses and other assets or the fair value of the forward contract liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s classification of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations represents revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of revenue. The Company has 
four
 revenue streams as described below.
Commission Revenue

– 
The Company charges its broker-dealer clients variable transaction fees for trades executed on its platforms and, under certain plans, distribution fees or monthly minimum fees to use the platforms for a particular product area. Variable transaction fees are recognized on a trade date basis, are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities generally generate lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. Under the Company’s disclosed trading transaction fee plans, variable transaction fees, distribution fees and unused monthly fee commitments are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.
For Open Trading trades that the Company executes between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. The commission is collected upon settlement of the trade, which typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. For the majority of the Company’s U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.

Following the Pragma Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also earns other commissions on equities and foreign exchange products for algorithmic trading services. These fees incorporate variable transaction fees, which are calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume traded and are billed on a monthly basis.

Information services – 
Information services includes data licensed to the Company’s broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. The nature and timing of each performance obligation may vary as these contracts are either subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services that are transferred at a point in time. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period as the Company’s performance obligation is met, whereas revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.

The majority of the Company’s information services and post-trade services contracts are short-term in nature with durations of less than one year. For contracts with original durations extending beyond one year, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $
47.0
 million as of December 31, 2024
. The Company expects to recognize revenue associated with the remaining performance obligations over the next 
46
 months.
Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years. Tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded in the provision for income taxes in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest.

Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, obsolescence and asset lives. Intangible assets are valued using various methodologies, including the relief-from-royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method.
The Company operates as a single reporting unit. Following an acquisition, goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit. As a result, all of the fair value of the Company is available to support the value of goodwill. An impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if circumstances change. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from 
one
 to 
15 years
 using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit the Company expects to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.

75

MARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Equity Investments and Consolidation
The Company evaluates equity investments for potential consolidation under the voting-interest or variable-interest models. The Company consolidates investees over which the Company determines it has control under the voting interest model, generally greater than 50% ownership, or for which the Company is the primary beneficiary under the variable-interest model. The Company uses the equity method of accounting when it exercises significant influence over the investee, but does not have operating control, generally between 20% and 50% ownership. Under the equity method of accounting, original investments are recorded at cost in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and adjusted by the Company’s proportionate share of the investees’ undistributed earnings or losses. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock reflects the dilutive effect that could occur if convertible securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted into or exercised for common stock.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The ASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The ASU also requires the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 and existing segment disclosures in ASC 280, Segment Reporting are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The ASU is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent interim periods. The ASU must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. The guidance may be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU will result in additional disclosures, but will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, operations and cash flows.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The ASU primarily will require enhanced disclosures about certain types of expenses. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, and may be applied either on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its disclosures.

3. Regulatory Capital Requirements
Certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers and are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the CFTC. These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the FCA in the U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of December 31, 2024, each of the Company’s subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $
574.6
 million in excess of the required levels of $
33.8
 million.

Stock Options

The exercise price of each option granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, option grants have provided for vesting over a 
three-year
 period. Options generally expire in 
six years
 from the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield rate and the expected term. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity value approximating the expected term of the option. The dividend yield rate is based on the expected annual dividends to be paid divided by the expected stock price. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior.

The weighted-average fair value for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
77.16
, $
123.47
 and $
101.38
, respectively.

15. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal
In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements may be involved in various lawsuits, proceedings and regulatory examinations. The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings, if any, utilizing the latest information available. For matters where it is probable that the Company will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company will establish an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual will be adjusted to reflect any relevant developments. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual.

Based on currently available information, the outcome of the Company’s outstanding matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position. It is not presently possible to determine the ultimate exposure to these matters and there is no assurance that the resolution of the outstanding matters will not significantly exceed any reserves accrued by the Company.
Other

The Company, through certain of its

subsidiaries, executes securities transactions between its institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. The Company’s operating subsidiaries settle such transactions pursuant to their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs 
within one to two trading days
 after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing models, the Company may be exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge the Company for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of the Company’s trades. The Company did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for 
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote
.

16. Segment and Geographic Information

The Company’s end-to-end trading solutions comprise 
one
 reportable segment. The Company’s end-to-end trading solutions segment includes the operation of electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income and other securities and related data, analytics, compliance tools, post-trade services and technology services. The Company derives revenue primarily in North America and Europe and manages its business activities on a consolidated basis. The Company considers its operations to constitute a single business segment due to the highly integrated nature of these products and services within the trading lifecycle, the use of a single inter-connected suite of technology solutions underlying all services, the financial markets in which the Company competes and the Company’s worldwide business activities.

The accounting policies of the Company's reportable segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The CODM assesses performance of the Company overall and decides how to allocate resources based on net income that is reported on the consolidated statement of operations as net income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated statement of financial condition as total assets. 
The Company’s CODM is its 
Chief Executive Office
r. The CODM uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the Company’s end-to-end trading solutions or into other areas, such as for acquisitions or to pay dividends. Net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results. The significant segment expenses and net income reviewed by the CODM conform to the presentation of such items in the consolidated statements of operations.
