Overview
SPS Commerce is transforming how our global retail supply chain co-operates by creating a more dynamic, interconnected community where players can more freely connect, collaborate, and prosper together. Our comprehensive suite of cloud-based products and solutions lead the industry in establishing and maintaining stronger collaboration between retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics firms around the globe. 
Our products enable customers to enhance how they operate: both within their organizations and with their trading partners, with reduced operational costs and stronger supply chain performance; compete: with order and supply chain visibility, sell-through data, and optimized inventory management, and; adapt: through the limitless access to connect and grow with the world’s largest retail network of trading partners that only SPS Commerce can offer.
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 45,350 customers with an active recurring revenue contract at the end of the period, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers, 
across approximately 90 countries
. 
Once connected to the SPS Commerce cloud-based retail network, our recurring revenue customers often require additional integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our cloud-based network and new sources of revenues for us.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we generated revenues of $637.8 million, $536.9 million, and $450.9 million, respectively. Our quarter ended December 31, 2024 represented our 96th consecutive quarter of revenue gr
owth. Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers acc
ounted for 94%, 94%, and 93% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Increasing Demand for a Retail Network
The retail industry is constantly evolving, and consumers expect more, which has accelerated the need for a more automated supply chain. To navigate disruptions and meet growing consumer demands, companies across the retail ecosystem need to integrate their operations and communications from wholesale, eCommerce, and marketplace sales channels into a single omnichannel process. These channels no longer operate independently but instead in an interconnected fashion as consumers demand more buying and delivery options. The coordination needed to manage multiple channels adds complexity to supply chains and trading partner relationships. The SPS Commerce retail network offers a single destination where companies can manage item details, orders, shipments, invoices, and much more for any customer and any channel.
Our Products
SPS Commerce operates one of the largest retail networks in the world to improve the way retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, and logistics firms work together. Our recurring revenue customers use SPS Comm
erce products to expand and optimize the performance of their trading relationships through the network.
Our products fundamentally change how organizations communicate information to manage their omnichannel, supply chain, and other business requirements. Our products replace traditional, manual, or disparate approaches (such as email, phone, and fax), multiple channel-specific solution providers, as well as custom-built, point-to-point integrations by delivering a single smart connection to the entire SPS Commerce retail network of prebuilt connections to thousands of global trading partners.
Our products include:
•
Fulfillment - 
Our Fulfillment product offers a comprehensive solution designed to streamline supply chain operations. Our connections empower retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics firms to efficiently send and receive order data, ensuring accurate execution of required processes from order to invoicing and revenue recovery through fully automated operations. By integrating seamlessly with existing systems, Fulfillment enhances day-to-day efficiency, reduces errors, and provides real-time visibility across all of our customers' order channels.

Analytics
 - 
Our Analytics product simplifies managing sell-through data from our customers’ business partners. We handle data acquisition, cleansing, normalization, and delivery. Our pre-built dashboards create custom reports, or integrate data with existing tools, to gain insights to enhance product performance, forecasting, pricing, and inventory management.
•
Other Products -
 We also have other complementary products, including:
◦
Assortment 
-
 Our Assortment product simplifies the communication of robust, accurate item data by automatically translating item attributes and hierarchies through a single connection across all sales channels.
◦
Community 
-
 Our Community product allows organizations to accelerate digitization of their supply chain and improve collaboration with suppliers through proven change management, onboarding programs, and supplier score carding.
In addition to these offerings, we also provide one-time services such as professional services and testing and certification.
Growing Our Network
As one of the largest providers of cloud-based services for retail supply chain management, SPS Commerce enables trading partner relationships among retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics firms that naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities.
“Network Effect”
Once connected to our retail network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. The value of our network increases with the number of trading partners connected to it. After joining our retail network, customers often find that many of their existing or new trading partners are already on the network, allowing for easy connections. The addition of each new customer enables that customer to communicate with our existing customers and permits our existing customers to do business with the new customer. This “network effect” of adding additional customers to our products’ infrastructure creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity among our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants.
Customer Acquisition Sources
Community - 
As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks. Our Community product is designed to manage this process and bring suppliers into compliance with new requirements. For instance, a supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers. In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with their trading partner base to enable the new capability. Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers generates supplier sales leads for us.
Referrals from Our Customers - 
We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners. For example, a supplier may refer a third-party logistics provider or manufacturer, which is not in our network, to us.
Direct Marketing - 
We employ various marketing strategies. Our marketing programs include a variety of lead generating activities including digital marketing, account-based marketing, conferences and trade shows, sponsored events, and public relations activities targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
Channel Partners - 
In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our products through a variety of channel partners, including software providers, resellers, system integrators, and logistics partners. For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage, and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts. Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our products as part of their service offerings

Our Growth Strategy
Our objective is to be the leading global retail network and provider of supply chain management products. Key elements of our strategy include:
•
Further Penetrate Our Current Market 
-

We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated. As the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically dispersed, we believe the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads.
•
Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base 
-

We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of our products they have purchased, as well as purchase additional products to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. We also expect to introduce new products to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers’ business systems, and the modular nature of our cloud-based products are conducive to deploying additional products with customers.
•
Expand Our Distribution Channels 
-

We intend to grow our business by expanding our sales capacity to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our products through collaboration with other providers.
•
Expand Our International Presence 
-

We believe our presence in Asia Pacific and Europe has created a foundation to expand our global presence. We plan to increase our global sales efforts to obtain new customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current global presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our products more valuable to their trading partners based overseas.
•
Enhance and Expand Our Services 
-

We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our cloud-based products, including, from time to time, developing new offerings and applications.
•
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 
-

The nature of our market provides an opportunity for selective acquisitions. We plan to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions based on the number of new customers, revenue, functionality, or geographic reach the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price, and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business. In 2024, we acquired SupplyPike, Inc. ("SupplyPike"),  a revenue recovery solution, Traverse Systems LLC ("Traverse Systems"), an industry-leading provider in retailer supply chain performance and vendor management, and Vision33's SAP Business One SPS Integration Technology. These acquisitions further extend the capabilities of our network and added new customers and technology.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe we have a significant market opportunity to help organizations accelerate their omnichannel retail strategies with our retail network and supply chain products. 
•
Omnichannel retail requires new connections/transactions 
-

Each sales channel (wholesale, eCommerce, and marketplaces) brings new trading partners to the supply chain process. As customers expand their business, the SPS Commerce retail network is a core part of their omnichannel strategy. Each additional channel brings more reliance and volume to the network and increases customer revenue.
•
Retail needs automation 
-

With increased retail store openings and closings, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and new buying patterns, retailers are demanding more from their trading partners as they need to be agile and transition their businesses as markets change. Businesses using SPS Commerce products to automate supply chain functions with their trading partners can pivot quickly to new delivery models and capture market share. The visibility into orders, shipments, and inventory gained by automating trading relationships on the SPS Commerce retail network is critical to their success and offers a competitive advantage.

Consumers want new products 
-

Retail assortments are ever-changing with seasonality shifts and new product introductions from companies of all sizes. Consumers want the latest products and retailers are continually chasing trends, offering differentiated items, and introducing new products and suppliers to their supply chains. As retailers evolve, their trading partner relationships must support any new product introductions or new suppliers to achieve their merchandising goals. The SPS Commerce retail network automates these relationships to quickly secure product details, initiate orders, and track performance to help keep operations running smoothly.
Technology, Development and Operations
Technology
SPS Commerce was an early provider of cloud-services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of what would become our current services in 1997. We use commercially available hardware and cloud-services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software.
Our cloud-service model treats all customers as logically separate tenants within a shared virtual infrastructure. As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our products across our customer base. Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the internet.
Development
Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining, improving, and enhancing our existing products, as well as developing new products and applications. Our multi-tenant products serve all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release software updates more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software products that support multiple versions. Our development efforts take place at our United States ("U.S.") locations in Minnesota, Iowa, Arkansas, and New Jersey, as well as in Melbourne, Australia; Toronto, Canada; Breukelen, Netherlands; and Kyiv, Ukraine.
Operations
We operate our infrastructure in third-party data centers located throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, as well as provisioned services with cloud providers. In most cases, infrastructure and services are managed by us.
We have internal and third-party monitoring software that continually checks the status of services and underlying infrastructure for availability and performance, helping ensure that the network is always available and providing desired service levels. We have a technology team that includes system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring, and back-up.
We operate a service architecture using industry best practices to ensure multiple points of redundancy, high availability, and scale as needed. Our databases are replicated between locations with a defined recovery point objective.
Sales & Marketing
We sell our products through an employed global sales force that focuses on retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, and logistics firms.
Our marketing teams focus on driving awareness and demand for our products through the following activities:
•
Demand Generation
 -

Engages with target audiences using the latest digital marketing strategies to bring opportunities to our sales teams.
•
Communications
 -

Manages our brand and public relations, as well as provides go-to-market support.
•
Product Marketing
 -

Equips our sales teams, performs market studies, and promotes the unique capabilities of each of our products using our go-to-market strategies.
•
Events 
-

Highlights our presence at industry trade shows and orchestrates virtual and in-person events.

Customer Success
The Customer Success team includes retail and technology experts who implement our products on our customers' behalf, provide ongoing support, and collaborate with accounts to identify opportunities for added value from their existing products. This team focuses on delivering services that build customer satisfaction and result in high customer retention rates.
Competition
Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer products through three delivery methods: traditional on-premise software, managed services, and cloud-based full-service products.
The market for cloud-based supply chain management products is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Cloud-service vendors compete directly with each other based mainly on the following:
•
the breadth of pre-built network connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners;
•
a history of establishing and maintaining reliable connections with trading partners;
•
the reputation of the cloud-service vendor in the supply chain management industry;
•
price;
•
specialization in a customer market segment;
•
speed and quality with which the cloud-service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners;
•
functionality of the cloud-service product, such as the ability to integrate the product with a customer’s business systems;
•
breadth of complementary supply chain management products the cloud-service vendor offers; and
•
training and customer support services provided during and after a customer’s initial integration.
Cloud-service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies. Traditional on-premise software uses a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud-service products that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer. Traditional on-premise requires customers to purchase, install, and manage specialized software, hardware, and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs. Additionally, customers are required to make significant upfront and ongoing investments to purchase, operate, and maintain the software. As such, a customer may be less willing to abandon their traditional on-premise product in favor of a cloud-service product.
Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market offer a cloud-based product in which they develop and maintain the core technology, while the customer’s internal staff is responsible for the day-to-day customization, optimization, and operations of the technology. 
In contrast, full-service providers, including SPS Commerce, offer cloud-based products and expert resources that customize, optimize, and operate the technology. This approach offloads the time-intensive process of managing these products, which is not a core competency for most businesses. Full-service cloud-based vendors compete with both managed service providers and traditional on-premise software products based on the total cost of ownership and flexibility.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content
SPS Commerce relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties, and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. 
Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We have two patents acquired through the acquisitions of GCommerce, Inc. and SupplyPike, Inc. Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce cloud-based products and network. Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights.
Human Capital
At SPS, we recognize that our employees are crucial to our ongoing growth and success. Our core values shape our culture and serve as the foundation for fostering an engaging workplace, attracting the right talent, and developing our teams. These values also inform how we interact with customers, partners, and each other. By nurturing an inclusive and high-performing culture, we attract, retain, and reward outstanding talent, providing employees with meaningful work and opportunities for personal and professional growth. 

Oversight and Governance 
Our board of directors, along with the Compensation and Talent Committee, oversees our human capital management as well as our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. They receive consistent updates from our Chief Human Resources Officer about key strategic initiatives and other significant human resources matters, which include hiring, development, retention, employee engagement, succession planning, compensation and benefits, and risks associated with human resources. 
Our People
As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of 2,783 employees worldwide, including 1,355 in cost of revenues, 733 in sales and marketing, 461 in research and development, and 234 in general and administrative. 82% are based in North America with the remaining in Europe and Asia Pacific. The majority of our employees are engaged on a full-time basis. We also utilize third-party agencies for staff augmentation to enhance our operations. While we have statutory obligations for employee representation in certain countries, none of our U.S. employees are unionized. 
38% of our global workforce identify as female and 2% did not specify their gender. Within the U.S. 17% of our employees self-identified as members of an underrepresented group. As of December 31, 2024, our executive team is comprised of 6 individuals, of which one-third are women.
Belonging@SPS
We power connections that drive the world of commerce forward, and our success depends on making strong decisions, fostering innovation, delivering unparalleled customer solutions, and driving outstanding business performance. We achieve this by creating an environment where every employee feels a true sense of belonging. We are committed to creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, valued, and empowered to contribute meaningfully. In 2024, we launched Belonging@SPS as a thoughtful update to our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belongin
g ("DEI(B)") 
statement and strategy. This initiative was shaped by employee feedback, designed to better reflect our core values, and tailored to ensure global relevance. We bring this commitment to life by embedding it into our human resources processes and integrating it into our talent strategies. 
Our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), a core part of our Belonging@SPS commitment, foster employee connections across the globe, and provide learning, engagement, and community-building for all SPS Commerce employees. We added two new ERGs in 2024, the Disability Empowerment Network and A+ (Asian, Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islanders). All employees are encouraged to participate in one or more of our ERGs, which also include our Black Business Resource Group, the LGBTQ+ Group, and Women in Tech.

We have taken meaningful steps to advance our commitment to diversity and inclusion by collaborating with local organizations that support underrepresented communities, including individuals with disabilities and those who are neurodiverse. Through these partnerships, we gain valuable insights into equipping our workplace with the tools and resources needed for every employee to succeed. Furthermore, our Talent Acquisition team has a focus area on recruiting individuals with disabilities and neurodiverse candidates, fostering an inclusive hiring process from initial recruitment to onboarding and ongoing professional development. Since 2021, all new hires have participated in an interactive inclusion curriculum. In 2024, we refreshed our new employee Belonging@SPS onboarding experience to identity awareness and belonging, focused on creating a safe work environment where employees feel comfortable bringing their full authentic selves to the workplace. Additionally, we continue to provide all managers with resources to support building inclusive teams. 
For over a decade, SPS has invested in and supported the communities in which we live and work, focused on efforts that expand our future talent pipeline by helping to develop the workforce of tomorrow. Over the years we have invested in student programs focused on creating opportunities for high school and college students who are part of underrepresented populations including women, genderqueer and non-binary individuals, and racial minorities. Interns make a meaningful impact by supporting real world projects. They work in all areas of the business and have access to mentorship, job shadows, and other professional development opportunities. 
Established in 2020, the SPS Diverse Scholar Program supports diverse first-generation college students (through funding from the SPS Foundation) pursuing a career in technology. In addition to receiving funding for their education, our diverse scholars participate in our internship program, have access to mentors, are offered part-time work during the school year, and are connected to a wide range of business professionals. 
Additionally, as a federal contractor we comply with applicable federal contractor affirmative action requirements. 
By embedding Belonging@SPS across the Company, we have built a solid foundation for sustainable growth. This dedication empowers us to foster an environment where every employee can thrive while enhancing our ability to serve and engage with customers and markets across the globe. 
Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Retention
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a variety of sources to meet current and future business needs. We have cultivated relationships with many colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCUs"), industry groups, professional associations, and other student programs focused on recruiting women, non-binary and genderqueer, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Our campus program focuses on bringing in talent with experience from schools that are leaders in technology, supply chain, engineering, and business. 64% of our most recent campus cohort hires identify as underrepresented minorities. 
We regularly survey our employees to better understand their perspectives and where we can focus to improve their experience. Our 2024 employee engagement survey indicated a positive engagement score of 70%, which is higher than the benchmark provided by our survey vendor both globally and for North American companies of similar size or within our sector. Additionally, our belonging index continues to score higher than benchmarks with an 81% positive perception score.
Our 2024 employee retention rate was 91%. We believe our strong company culture and focus on providing meaningful work, professional development, flexible work options, competitive pay and benefits, as well as our commitment to belonging contributes to our high employee retention.
Growth and Development
We are shifting training and development from a traditional, program-centric model to a learner-driven strategy that empowers employees to take ownership of their professional growth. Our focus is on fostering a culture where learning how to learn is as critical as acquiring specific skills. This evolution represents more than a tactical shift; it’s a cultural transformation built on our longstanding commitment to learning, which is ingrained in the fabric of our organization. 
Our goal is to foster a mindset of continuous reinvention, preparing our teams to meet today’s challenges while adapting to the rapid evolution of global commerce. In 2024, we took significant steps toward establishing a dynamic, experiential learning model designed to drive performance and behavioral change through active engagement in daily work. 
Development of our employees and leaders results in high performing teams who are empowered to grow their careers and deliver exceptional results, beginning on the first day of employment with SPS. When new employees join

SPS, they attend a robust new hire onboarding program that focuses on the skills necessary to become productive employees, including training on company technology, collaboration tools, our company culture, values, and a comprehensive Belonging@SPS experience. Onboarding is followed by on-the-job training and regular performance and development discussions between employees and their managers.  
We are committed to providing ongoing opportunities for employees to build new skills, excel in their current roles, and prepare for future opportunities. Every employee has access to an online learning platform that supports their growth, along with resources designed to help them explore and advance into management roles. 
Looking ahead, we are placing a strong emphasis on professional development at the highest levels of the Company. Our aim is to equip leaders and managers with the mindsets, tools, and practical experience needed to excel while empowering their teams to achieve success. 
We assess leadership talent across the organization through a rigorous talent review process, allowing us to distinguish individuals based on performance and potential. This process forms the foundation for succession planning in critical roles. Additionally, our performance review framework integrates the SPS leadership model, ensuring leaders are evaluated not only on their outcomes but also on how well they exemplify essential leadership competencies. 
As we grow, we remain committed to cultivating an environment that promotes continuous learning, supports career mobility, and empowers employees to build the skills and connections needed to thrive. Our initiatives are focused on driving success for our people and customers, propelling the growth of the Company. 
The SPS Leadership Model is built on four key pillars: People Developer, Culture Champion, Strategist, and Results Enabler. These competencies shape our leadership development programs as we continue to create tools and resources to enhance our leaders’ ability to grow and scale their teams effectively. 
In 2024, our senior leadership team completed 360-degree assessments, leveraging the insights to incorporate their strengths and growth opportunities into personalized development plans. Additionally, we conducted a thorough organizational talent review to evaluate leadership across all levels, allowing us to distinguish talent based on both performance and potential. 
Total Rewards and Employee Well-being
At SPS, our total rewards strategy is designed to support the financial, physical, and mental well-being of our employees and their families. We offer market-competitive pay and comprehensive benefits programs tailored to our global workforce. Our packages are thoughtfully crafted to attract, retain, and motivate top talent, featuring robust healthcare offerings, an employee stock purchase plan available in most jurisdictions, and other region-specific benefits. 
We are committed to equitable pay practices, ensuring employees are compensated fairly regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. To uphold this commitment, we regularly review pay data in the U.S. and other regions to ensure fairness and equity. 
At SPS, employee well-being is a core priority. We are dedicated to fostering a holistic approach to well-being that encompasses physical, mental, financial, career, and social dimensions. Through our partnership with a global Employee Assistance Program (EAP), we provide curated mental health and wellness webinars, access to licensed mental health professionals, and complimentary sessions for employees and their dependents. In the U.S., our healthcare platform offers virtual mental health solutions, featuring tools for mindfulness, meditation, and overall wellness support. 
In 2023, we introduced the Wellbeing at SPS intranet site, providing a centralized hub for employees to easily access our comprehensive well-being programs. In 2024, we emphasized the importance of preventive care, encouraging employees to take proactive steps in managing their physical and mental health, fostering a healthier and more productive workforce. Additionally, SPS expanded its focus on financial well-being by offering educational resources and support programs aimed at empowering employees to achieve financial security and stability.
