Key Financial Terms, Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Sources of Revenues
Recurring Revenues
We primarily derive our revenues from subscription-based recurring revenue services, which are
 recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term. The following are our recurring revenue streams:
Fulfillment - 
Our Fulfillment product is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline supply chain operations. Our connections empower retailers, grocers, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics firms to efficiently send and receive order data, ensuring accurate execution of required processes from order to invoicing and revenue recovery through fully automated operations.

 of Contents
Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses
Cost of Revenues - 
Cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, and technology costs for our customer success and implementation teams, customer support personnel, and application support personnel, as well as amortization related to internally developed software.
Sales and Marketing Expenses - 
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and stock-based compensation expense for our sales, marketing, and product management teams, external marketing costs, and commissions earned by our sales personnel and referral partners.
Research and Development Expenses - 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, and technology costs for development of new and maintenance of existing products, net of amounts capitalized as developed software.
General and Administrative Expenses - 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, and technology costs for finance, human resources, and internal security and technology support, as well as professional services and other fees, such as bad debt expense and credit card processing fees.
Overhead Allocation - 
We allocate overhead expenses such as rent, certain employee benefit costs, certain software costs, and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenues and operating expenses categories based on expense type using department headcount or salary.
Amortization of Intangibles Assets
 - Amortization expense consists of the expense recognition of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of investment income, in addition to realized gain (loss) from investments held and realized gain (loss) from foreign currency impacts on cash and investments. 
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense consists primarily of income taxes for U.S. federal jurisdiction in addition to income taxes for various state and international jurisdictions.
Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Recurring Revenue

-
 We define recurring revenue 
as active contracts during the reporting period to regularly pay us fees for subscription-based and reoccurring services. All components of the contracts that are not expected to recur (primarily set ups and professional services) are excluded from recurring revenue.
Recurring Revenue Customers - 
We define recurring revenue customers as customers with an active recurring revenue contract at the end of the period. A s
mall portion of our recurring revenue customers consist of separate units within a larger organization and are separately invoiced. We treat each of these units, which may include divisions, departments, affiliates and franchises, as distinct recurring revenue customers.
Wallet Share - 
We calculate the annualized average recurring revenues per recurring revenue customer, which we also refer to as wallet share, by dividing the annualized recurring revenues for the period by the average of the beginning and ending number of recurring revenue customers for the period.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures - 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide investors with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and non-GAAP income per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to our management, board of directors, and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.
28
Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2024
Table
 of Contents
Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to an investor as they are widely used in evaluating operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are used to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in this “
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
A critical accounting policy or estimate is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments relating to uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, we believe that our policies for revenue recognition, internally developed software, and business combinations are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are the amount that reflects the consideration we are contractually and legally entitled to, as well as the amount we expect to collect, in exchange for those services. Set-up fees, a component of our revenue, are specific for each connection a customer has with a trading partner. These nonrefundable fees are necessary for our customers to utilize our services and do not provide any standalone value. Many of our customers have connections with numerous trading partners.
Set-up fees constitute a material renewal option right that provide customers a significant future incentive that would not be otherwise available to that customer unless they entered into the contract, as the set-up fees will not be incurred again upon contract renewal. As such, set-up fees and related costs are deferred and recognized ratably, generally over two years, which is the estimated period for which a material right is present for our customers.
Internally Developed Software
Internally developed software consists of capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs related to the design of the chosen path, coding, installation of the hardware necessary to run the software, and any testing done before the operational stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Additionally, maintenance of internally developed software is expensed as incurred. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, generally three years, commencing on the earlier date in which the asset is placed in service or ready for its intended use. The assets and related accumulated amortization are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.

Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets may include, but are not limited to, utilizing variants of the income approach, such as the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, which estimate future expected cash flows from acquired customers and developed technology from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Significant estimates in valuing liabilities for contingent consideration may include, but are not limited to, discount rates, projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results.
Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.

Revenues
 - 
Revenues increased for the 96th consecutive quarter.

The increase in revenue period-over-period resulted primarily from the increase in average recurring revenues per recurring revenue customer, which we also refer to as wallet share. Additionally, the revenue growth was attributable to an increase in recurring revenue customers, which is driven primarily by continued business growth and by business acquisitions.
•
Wallet share increased 15% to approximately $13,300 for the year ended December 31, 2024 from approximately $11,550 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily attributable to increased usage of our products by our recurring revenue customers.
•
The number of recurring revenue customers increas
ed 
1%
 to approximately 
45,350
 at December 31, 2024 from approximately 
44,800

at December 31, 2023 primarily due to sales and marketing efforts to acquire new customers and due to recent acquisitions. New recurring revenue customers do not have a meaningful contribution to revenue at the beginning of their tenure as our recurring revenue customer, and therefore a majority of the increased revenue was generated from existing recurring revenue customers.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.

Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2024
Table
 of Contents
•
Approximately 1,000 recurring revenue customers were added in September 2023 due to the acquisition of the existing customer base of TIE Kinetix. Approximately 50 recurring revenue customers were added in May 2024 due to the acquisition of the existing customer base of Traverse Systems, and approximately 200 recurring revenue customers were added in July 2024 due to the acquisition of the existing customer base of SupplyPike.
Recurring revenues increased 20% to $600,089 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and accounted for 94% of our total revenues in 2024 and 2023. We anticipate that the number of recurring revenue customers and wallet share will continue to increase as we execute our growth strategy focused on further penetration of our market.
Cost of Revenues

- The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $22.5 million in personnel-related costs. Additionally, there was an increase in software subscriptions of $4.0 million due to general growth of our business.
Sales and Marketing

Expenses
 - 
The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in increases of $17.6 million in personnel-related costs and $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, there was an increase of $3.9 million in product management costs.
Research and Development Expenses
 - 
The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $9.0 million in personnel-related costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
 - 
The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in increases of $7.1 million in personnel-related costs and $3.5 million in stock-based compensation expense.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
 - 
The increase in amortization of intangible assets was driven by increased intangible assets related to recent business acquisitions.
Other Income, Net
 - The increase was primarily due to increased investment income.
Income Tax Expense
 - 
The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income, partially offset by a decrease in nondeductible executive compensation and an increase in tax benefits from credits and foreign derived intangible income.
Adjusted EBITDA
 - 
Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income adjusted for income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, realized gain or loss from investments held and foreign currency impact on cash and investments, investment income, and other adjustments as necessary for a fair presentation.
 Other adjustments for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 
included the expense impacts from disposals of certain capitalized internally developed software and one-time acquisition-related insurance costs. Other adjustments for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 
included the expense impacts from disposals of certain capitalized internally developed software and acquisition-related employee severance costs. 
Net income is the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance.

Non-GAAP Income per Share
 - 
Non-GAAP income per share consists of net income adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense related to intangible assets, realized gain or loss from investments held and foreign currency impact on cash and investments, other adjustments as necessary for a fair presentation, including for the year ended December 31, 2024
 the expense impacts from disposals of certain capitalized internally developed software and one-time acquisition-related insurance costs
, and for the year ended December 31, 2023
 the expense impacts from disposals of certain capitalized internally developed software and acquisition-related employee severance costs, 
and the corresponding tax impacts of the adjustments to net income, divided by the weighted average number of shares of common and diluted stock outstanding during each period. Net income per share, the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance, consists of net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common and diluted stock outstanding during each period. To quantify the tax effects, we recalculated income tax expense excluding the direct book and tax effects of the specific items constituting the non-GAAP adjustments. The difference between this recalculated income tax expense and GAAP income tax expense is presented as the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments.

Operating Activities
The increase in cash provided by operating activities from the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash expenses, of $28.2 million, driven by continued growth in revenue, as partially offset by cash paid for expenses to operate the growing business. Additionally, fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease of $3.1 million, driven by changes in the amount and timing of settlements and general growth of the business.
Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities from the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash used to acquire businesses of $77.7 million to further grow our business, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by net maturities of investments of $60.2 million.
Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities from the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for share repurchases of $37.6 million to continue to deliver shareholder value.

Future Capital Requirements
Our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those now planned and will depend on many factors, including:
•
costs to develop and implement new products and applications, if any;
•
sales and marketing resources needed to further penetrate our market and gain acceptance of new products and applications that we may develop;
•
expansion of our operations in the U.S. and internationally;
•
response of competitors to our products and applications; and

use of capital for acquisitions.
Historically, we have experienced increases in our expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and personnel, and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase as we expand our business.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.
Foreign Currency Exchange and Inflation Rate Changes
For information regarding the effects of foreign currency exchange and inflation rate changes, refer to the section entitled “
Foreign Currency Exchange and Inflation Risk,
” included in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note A, General, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the sections entitled “
Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
” and “
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
” as applicable, included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Sensitivity Risk
The principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We may choose based on our investment strategy to hold cash, cash equivalents, and investments in interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing accounts. Based upon a sensitivity model
, an immediate hypothetical 50-basis point change in interest rates at December 31, 2024 would have resulted in a $1.0 million impact on our investment income included in net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We did not have any variable interest rate outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024.

Foreign Currency Exchange and Inflation Risk
Due to international operations, we have revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Euro. Our consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our predominate exposure to foreign currency exchange rates are due to non-monetary assets held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and thus fluctuations in currencies primarily result in comprehensive income (loss), not net income (loss).
Our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the local currencies in which our operations are located. As of December 31, 2024, we maintained 13% of our total cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies. Based upon a sensitivity model, an immediate hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in all foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a $3.2 million impact on our cash and cash equivalents held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2024.
We have not used any forward contracts or currency borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk, although we may do so in the future.
During the last three years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
SPS Commerce, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SPS Commerce, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over fulfillment and analytics revenue
As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally derived from recurring subscriptions to the Company’s Fulfillment and Analytics products. The Company recorded $523.7 million and $55.7 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, for the Fulfillment and Analytics products, respectively. The Company’s revenue recognition process is highly automated and is reliant upon information technology (IT) systems customized to recognize and record revenue.
We identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over fulfillment and analytics revenue as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required in determining the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue as well as the need to involve IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over fulfillment and analytics revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the general IT and application controls of the systems used in the Company’s revenue recognition process. We performed a software-assisted data analysis to test relationships among certain revenue transactions. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized by the Company with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample of transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the arrangement. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
SPS Commerce, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited SPS Commerce, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
The Company acquired SupplyPike during 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, SupplyPike’s internal control over financial reporting associated with less than 5% of consolidated assets and less than 5% of consolidated revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of SupplyPike.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of SPS Commerce, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate during the year. The translation adjustments are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Use of Estimates
Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 
Assets acquired include tangible and intangible assets. We use estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable as a part of the purchase price allocation, which includes the process to determine the fair value of purchased intangible assets and the process to determine the value of any contingent consideration liabilities. We value identifiable intangible assets using variants of the income approach, such as the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods. The income approach uses estimates such as future expected cash flows from acquired customers and developed technology from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates to estimate the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets. We record the acquisition-date fair value of any contingent liabilities, such as earn-out provisions, as part of the consideration transferred, if present. The unsettled earn-out liability, if any, is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date at fair value through earnings.
While we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any such adjustments would be recorded as an offset to goodwill or a working capital purchase price adjustment as applicable. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair values, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments would be recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Segment Information
The single operating and reporting segment we have is Supply Chain Management Solutions. This segment derives revenues from customers by providing access to our cloud-based supply chain management services, primarily under subscription-based service arrangements.
Our Chief Executive Officer acts as the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Our CODM primarily reviews revenue, consolidated net income, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. These measures are used to monitor budget versus actual results as well as trends versus historical performance, which are the CODM's primary considerations to assess performance. The CODM does not use an asset measure to allocate resources or evaluate the consolidated performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by the CODM, or anyone else, for operations, operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure also reported in 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits, accounts receivable, and investments. Cash and cash equivalents are held with financial institutions that we believe are subject to minimal risk. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are subject to the financial condition of our customers, which are routinely assessed for potential credit losses. We believe that the receivable credit risk exposure is limited. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer and sets requirements regarding credit rating and investment maturities to safeguard liquidity and minimize risk.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days.
Investments
We invest in money market funds, certificates of deposit, and/or marketable securities such as commercial paper, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, and U.S. corporate debt securities. Investments with remaining maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments whereas those with remaining maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as investments, non-current. 
Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses on these investments, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, on a specific identification basis. Certain securities accrue interest that is included in other income (expense), net as investment income. Investment income includes interest earned on securities, net of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts from the purchase of available for sale securities, and interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. If a determination has been made that the fair value of a marketable security is below its amortized cost basis, the portion of the unrealized loss that corresponds to a credit-related factor is realized through a credit allowance on the marketable security and the equivalent expense is realized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Fair Value Measurements
The carrying amounts of our short-term financial instruments, which include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis based on a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that are used to measure fair value are:
•
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.
45
Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2024
Table
 of Contents
•
Level 2 – observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, (b) quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or (c) model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
•
Level 3 – unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are initially recorded upon the sale and invoicing of products to customers. Credit is granted in the normal course of business without collateral. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for credit losses, which represent estimated losses resulting from customers not making required payments on accounts receivables. When determining the allowance, we pool our outstanding accounts receivable invoices based on the contractual due date of payment. We take several factors into consideration for estimated credit losses by pool, primarily our historical credit losses, with additional adjustments made for current and future macro-economic conditions and retail bankruptcy trends. We write-off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible. Changes in the allowance are recorded as bad debt expense and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment, including assets acquired under lease obligations, are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, commencing on the earlier date in which the asset is placed in service or ready for its intended use.
The estimated useful lives of property and equipment were as follows:
Estimated Useful Life
Internally developed software
3
 years
Computer equipment
3
 years
Office equipment and furniture
5
-
7
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease
Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives beyond one year are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
We capitalize and amortize eligible costs to acquire or generate internally developed software that are incurred during the application development stage, which include costs related to the design of the chosen path, coding, installation of the hardware necessary to run the software, and any testing done before the operational stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Additionally, maintenance of internally developed software is expensed as incurred.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases with initial terms longer than 12 months are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current operating lease liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.

Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2024
Table
 of Contents
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use the implicit interest rate when readily determinable. We estimate the discount rate for a similar collateralized asset by estimating costs of borrowing. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and lease incentives that have been incurred. The options to extend our leases are not recognized as part of our ROU assets and lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For all leases, we combine non-lease components with the related lease components and account for it as a single lease component. The ROU assets are subject to the same impairment process as our long-lived assets. Additionally, we review our lease liabilities for remeasurement whenever there is a triggering event or when relevant facts and circumstances change.
Research and Development
Research and development costs primarily include development, maintenance, and data conversion activities related to our cloud-based supply chain management products and are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs are net of amounts capitalized as internally developed software.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is attributed to a trained workforce and other buyer-specific value resulting from expected synergies, including long-term cost savings, which are not included in the fair values of identifiable assets. 
We test goodwill for impairment annually at November 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test is conducted by comparing the fair value of the net assets with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. We determine the fair value of our single reporting unit based on our market capitalization at the testing date. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we would recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

Intangible Assets
Assets acquired in business combinations may include identifiable intangible assets such as subscriber relationships and developed technology. We recognize the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired separately from goodwill. We have determined the fair value and useful lives of our purchased intangible assets using certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

The estimated useful lives for intangible assets were as follows:
Estimated Useful Life
Subscriber relationships
7
-
10
 years
Developed technology
5
-
10
 years
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets at the date it is tested for recoverability, whether in use or under development. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are the amount that reflects the consideration we are contractually and legally entitled to, as well as the amount we expect to collect, in exchange for those services.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.
47
Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2024

We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer 
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract 
•
Determination of the transaction price 
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
See Note C for further descriptions of our revenue recognition policy.
Deferred Costs
Deferred costs are those that are incurred to fulfill or obtain customer contracts and that are considered incremental and recoverable costs. These consist primarily of customer implementation costs and certain commissions paid to sales personnel and referral partners, respectively, at contract inception. These costs are deferred and amortized over the expected period of benefit which we have determined primarily to be 
two years
.
Customer implementation costs are based on actual costs

incurred. Related amortization expense is included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Sales commissions are calculated based on estimated annual recurring revenue to be generated over the customer’s initial contract period. Related amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation includes grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, performance share units (“PSUs”), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”), employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) activity, and 401(k) stock match and is used to compensate employees, executive officers, and non-employee directors. 
We recognize the cost of all stock-based payments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. This cost is recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the award performance period, except for expenses relating to retirement-eligible employees that have not given their required notice, which is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the notice period prior to retirement. For all awards, we recognize forfeitures as they occur.
RSAs result in the issuance of new shares of common stock when granted. For other stock-based awards, new shares of common stock are issued when the award is exercised, vested, or released according to the terms of the agreement.
Our ESPP allows participating employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The plan is available to all employees subject to certain eligibility requirements. Participating employees may purchase common stock, on a voluntary after-tax basis, at a price that is the lower of 
85
% of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each stock purchase period. The plan is a Type B plan, so the number of shares a participants can acquire is variable. Participants purchase more shares as the stock price decreases, up to the total amount originally elected to withhold at the beginning of the offering period. The plan consists of 
two

six-month
 offering periods, beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year.
The fair value of stock options and ESPP activity is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value for RSAs, RSUs, and DSUs is the closing market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant less the purchase price (if any). The fair value of PSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
Judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share-based awards prior to exercising. The expected volatility of the options is based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of the options is derived from historical data on option holder exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior.
 SPS COMMERCE, INC.

Additional valuation inputs include our expected non-issuance of future common stock dividends and the risk-free interest rate that is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equaling the expected life at the grant date. For PSUs, the Monte Carlo simulation utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award.

Share Repurchases and Reissuances
Share repurchases, reflected as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets, are accounted for as the trade date occurs and are reflected net of the costs incurred to acquire the shares. Share repurchases that have not yet settled in cash are included 
in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Treasury stock reissuances are accounted for using the specific identification method, with gains (or losses to the extent of previously recognized gains) recognized in additional paid-in capital and any remaining loss recorded in retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax positions are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax positions are net by jurisdiction on the consolidated balance sheet.
We assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. Realization of our deferred tax assets is contingent upon future taxable earnings. Accordingly, this assessment requires estimates and judgment. If the estimates of future taxable income vary from actual results, our assessment regarding the realization of these deferred tax assets could change. Future changes in the estimated amount of deferred taxes expected to be realized will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the period the estimate is changed, with a corresponding adjustment to our operating results.
We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would “more likely than not” sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the “more likely than not” threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 
We are subject to income taxes for U.S. federal and various state and international jurisdictions. We are generally subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for most prior tax years due to our net operating loss and research & development credit carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute. The deferred tax asset for the federal net operating loss carryforward is reported net of the Section 382 limitations.
When applicable, the Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share also includes the impact of our outstanding potential common shares. Potential common shares that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share.

Recurring Revenues
We define recurring revenue 
as active contracts during the reporting period to regularly pay us fees for subscription-based and reoccurring services. All components of the contracts that are not expected to recur (primarily set ups and professional services) are excluded from recurring revenue.
Revenue for subscription-based services is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our contracts primarily range from monthly to annual and generally allow the customer to cancel the contract for any reason with 
30
 to 
90
 days’ notice. Timing of billings varies by customer and by contract type and are either in advance or within 
30
 days of the service being performed.
Given that the recurring revenue contracts are generally for one year or less, we have applied the optional exemption to not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations for recurring revenue contracts.
One-time Revenues
One-time revenues consist of set-up fees and miscellaneous fees from customers.
Set-up revenues
Set-up fees, a component of our revenue, are specific for each connection a customer has with a trading partner. These nonrefundable fees are necessary for our customers to utilize our services and do not provide any standalone value. Many of our customers have connections with numerous trading partners.
Set-up fees constitute a material renewal option right that provide customers a significant future incentive that would not be otherwise available to that customer unless they entered into the contract, as the set-up fees will not be incurred again upon contract renewal. As such, set-up fees and related costs are deferred and recognized ratably, generally over 
two years
, which is the estimated period for which a material right is present for our customers.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Assessment of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This assessment was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed such that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and financial officers, we assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this assessment, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the specified criteria.
Pursuant to the SEC’s general guidance that the assessment of a recently acquired business' internal control over financial reporting may be omitted in the year of acquisition, the scope of the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 excluded SupplyPike (acquired in July 2024). Our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2025 will include SupplyPike. Excluding net intangible assets and goodwill, SupplyPike represented less than 5% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024 and less than 5% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
