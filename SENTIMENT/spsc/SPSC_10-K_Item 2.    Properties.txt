Item 2.    Properties
Our corporate headquarters, including our principal administrative, marketing, sales, technical support, and research and development facilities, are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This location includes approximately 200,000 square feet of space and is under lease through 2027. We lease other smaller facilities across the U.S. and international locations. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of our operations. For additional information regarding obligations under operating leases, see Note I of our consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
