Contingent Shares Issued in BASX Acquisition
 - On December 10, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of BASX. Under the MIPA Agreement, we committed to $78.0 million in the aggregate of contingent consideration to the former owners of BASX, which was payable in approximately 1.56 million shares of AAON stock, par value $0.004 per share. The shares did not accrue dividends.  
Under the MIPA Agreement, the issuance of shares to the former owners of BASX was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. In March 2024, we issued the remaining 0.2 million shares related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2023. As a result of the shares issued in March 2024, the tax basis exceeded the book basis for consideration paid resulting in a deferred tax asset and an increase to additional paid-in capital of 6.4 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is expected to be amortized over fifteen years. We previously issued 0.6 million shares and 0.7 million related to the earn-out milestones for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. All shares have been issued as private placements exempt from registration with the SEC under Rule 506(b) and are included in common stock on the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. 
Authorized Shares Outstanding
An amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase its total authorized common shares from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 was approved by our stockholders on May 21, 2024, at the Company’s Annual Meeting. On July 9, 2024, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State to effectuate the increase in authorized shares.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Description of the Company
AAON is a leader in HVAC solutions for commercial and industrial indoor environments. The company’s industry-leading approach to designing and manufacturing highly configurable equipment to meet exact needs creates a premier ownership experience with greater efficiency, performance, and long-term value. AAON is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where its world-class innovation center and testing capabilities enable continuous advancement toward a cleaner and more sustainable future. 
We engineer, manufacture, and sell premium heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment consisting of semi-custom and custom rooftop units, data center cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls. These products are marketed and sold to a variety of vertical markets including retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, data centers, medical and pharmaceutical, industrial, and other commercial markets. We sell our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. 

Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The uncertainty of the economy negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets in 2020 and the first half of 2021. Since mid-2021, nonresidential construction spending has been strong, recovering well beyond pre-2020 levels and finishing 2024 near record levels. However, over the last 18-24 months, certain leading indicators, including architectural billings and construction starts, signal a slowing in construction spending within the next 12 months. In 2024, the year-over-year growth rate of nonresidential construction spending slowed significantly, reinforcing the signals from these leading indicators. Furthermore, signals from general economic indicators are mixed regarding the health of the general economy. If the domestic economy were to slow or enter a recession, this could impact the replacement market, potentially resulting in a decline in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets generally lag behind the housing market, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates, the state of the economy and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. Sales in the replacement markets are driven by various factors, including general economic growth, the Company's new product introductions, fluctuations in the average age of existing equipment in the market, government regulations and stimulus, change in market demand between more customized, higher performing HVAC equipment and lower priced standard equipment, as well as many other factors. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market.
We sell our products to property owners and contractors mainly through a network of independent manufacturers’ Representatives. This go-to-market strategy is unique compared to most of our larger competitors in that most control their sales channel. We value the independent sales channel as we think it is a more effective way of increasing market share. Although we concede full control of the sales process with this strategy, the entrepreneurial aspect of the independent sales channel attracts the most talent and provides greater financial incentives for its salespeople. Further, the independent sales channel sells different types of equipment from various manufacturers, allowing it to operate with more of a solutions-based mindset, as opposed to an internal sales department of a manufacturing company that is incentivized to only sell its equipment regardless if it is the best solution for the end customer. We also have a small internal sales force that supports the relationships between the Company and our sales channel partners. BASX sells highly customized products for unique applications for a more concentrated customer base and an internal sales force is more effective for such products. 
The principal components of cost of sales are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight out, and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper, and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including coils, compressors, motors, and electrical controls.
23
The price levels of our raw materials fluctuate due to various economic factors within the U.S. and global economy. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the prices for copper and galvanized steel increased by approximately 3.2% and 1.7%, respectively, while stainless steel and aluminum decreased 27.9% and 1.6%, respectively, from 2023. 
We attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our contracts for use in our manufacturing operations.
We occasionally increase the price of our products to help offset any inflationary headwinds. In recent years, price increases have been more frequent due to the amount of inflation the business has endured. In 2021, we implemented three price increases for AAON branded products. In 2022, we implemented two significant price increases as well as a recurring 1% monthly price increase beginning June 1, 2022, and ending on April 1, 2023, for AAON branded products. We reinstated a recurring 1% monthly price increase on October 1, 2023, and carried that through February 1, 2024, for AAON branded products. On January 1, 2025, we implemented a one-time 3% price increase for AAON branded products. BASX branded products are priced by job and in most cases, provide the ability to increase the price if the order is outside normal lead times.  

Additionally, we continue to experience challenges in a tight labor market, especially the hiring of both skilled and unskilled production labor. We have implemented the following wage increases to remain competitive and to attract and retain employees:
•
In March 2023, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.9% increase to wages.
•
In March 2024, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.3% increase to wages.
We will continue to implement human resource initiatives to retain and attract labor to further improve productivity and production efficiencies.

 Presented after intercompany eliminations.
Total net sales increased $32.1 million, or 2.7%. BASX increased by 25.1%, or $39.8 million, and AAON Coil Products increased 28.1%, or $31.6 million, both primarily related to demand from the BASX branded data center products. AAON Oklahoma sales decreased 4.4%, or $39.2 million due to challenges from the industry-regulated refrigerant transition and nonresidential construction activity that experienced weakened demand throughout 2024 as compared to 2023.
Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to 33.1% during 2024 as compared to 34.1% in 2023. As noted above, realization of price increases has improved our margin profile along with the slowing of inflation; however, the price increases were offset by flat volumes and lower overhead absorption for the AAON Oklahoma segment. In addition, the AAON Coil Products and BASX segments experienced temporary inefficiencies associated with facility construction to increase future production capacity for increased demand of BASX branded data center products.
In order to retain our existing employees, we have increased our starting wage rate considerably in recent years and continue to award periodic wage increases to our employees. We occasionally increase the price of our products to help offset any inflationary headwinds. In 2022, we implemented a recurring 1% monthly price increase beginning June 1, 2022, and ending on April 1, 2023. We reinstated the recurring 1% monthly price increase on October 1, 2023, through February 1, 2024.
As shown in the table below, we have experienced year-over-year fluctuations in the cost of several raw materials.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9.6%, or $16.5 million, during 2024 as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative increased from 14.7% to 15.7%. Depreciation and amortization increased 49.3%, or $6.8 million, as compared to 2023, due to increased investments in back office technology and automation. Other expenses increased 34.5%, or $10.3 million, due to increased travel, consulting expenses, and closing costs related to the 2023 New Market Tax Credit (Note 18).

The Company’s estimated annual 2024 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, was 24.7%.
The decrease year over year in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due to the excess tax benefit of $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $8.9 million during the same period in 2023. The excess tax benefit is related to the timing of stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings as a result of our high stock price during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time.
Working Capital -
 Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased $0.3 million from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  
Outstanding Debt 
-
 On December 16, 2024, we amended our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated November 24, 2021 (as amended, “Amended Loan Agreement”) to include an $80.0 million term loan (“Term Loan”) in addition to the $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”).  
As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding balance under the Revolver of $76.5 million and $38.3 million, respectively. We had one standby letter of credit totaling $0.3 million as of December 31, 2024, and two standby letters of credit totaling $2.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Borrowings available under the Revolver at December 31, 2024, were $123.2 million. The Revolver expires on May 27, 2027.
As of December 31, 2024, we had an outstanding balance under the Term Loan of $78.4 million.  No amounts were outstanding under the Term Loan at December 31, 2023.  The Term Loan is payable in equal month installments, plus interest, over 60 months, expiring December 16, 2029.  
Any outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus the applicable margin. The Term Loan bears interest at the SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum plus the Applicable Margin.
Applicable margin, ranging from 1.25% - 1.75%, is determined quarterly based on the Company’s leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from 1.25% - 1.75%, and a commitment fee, ranging from 0.10% - 0.20%. The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly based on the Company’s leverage ratio. 
Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Weighted average interest rate of our borrowings outstanding are as follows:

 Funds were borrowed on December 16, 2024.  No borrowings outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
If SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Amended Loan Agreement, any outstanding effected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate (“ABR”) loans. ABR loans would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00%. As of December 16, 2024, as defined by the Amended Loan Agreement, if the SOFR cannot be determined any outstanding balance will bear interest at the Prime Rate in effect on such day.
At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as defined by the Revolver. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2024, our leverage ratio was 0.57 to 1.0, which meets the requirement of not being above 3 to 1.
2019 New Markets Tax Credit

 Effective with the cash dividend declared on March 1, 2023 (paid on March 31, 2023), the Company moved from semi-annual cash dividends to quarterly cash dividends.
On July 7, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company’s common stock that was paid in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2023, received one additional share for every two shares they held as of that date on August 16, 2023 (ex-dividend date August 17, 2023). All share and per share information has been updated to reflect the effects of this stock split.
Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the projected cash flows generated from our operations, our existing committed revolving credit facility (or comparable financing), and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in 2025 and the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - 
We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The Company currently manages cash needs through working capital as well as drawing on its line of credit. Collections and payments cycles are on a normal pattern and fluctuate due to timing of receipts and payments. In early 2022, the Company began increasing the purchase of inventory to take advantage of favorable pricing opportunities and also to mitigate the impact of future supply chain disruptions on our operations; however, as inflationary and supply chain disruptions have decreased, the Company has been able to reduce overall inventory levels. At the end of 2024, we made significant purchases of inventory related to data center orders. These purchases are allocated to customer jobs and show as increases to our contract assets.
Payment terms for BASX jobs may require upfront cash to fund the job resulting in cash inflows related to our contract liabilities and cash inflows fluctuate due to job timing and scheduling.
31
The decrease in cash flows from income taxes is primarily due to the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which requires research and development expenses incurred after December 31, 2021, to be capitalized and amortized over five years.  This defers our current period income tax deduction which increased our income tax payments due at the end of 2022.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The capital expenditures increase during 2024 related to our continued investment in our production capabilities. Purchases during 2024 include additional infrastructure and machinery for both replacement and growth. We added 237,500 square feet to our Longview, Texas facility primarily for the production of BASX branded data center products.  We also completed the addition of a new Weld Shop in Redmond, Oregon that created more capacity in our manufacturing building. In Parkville, Missouri, we built an SMT production line to produce our own control boards. We have also made investments to purchase and develop software for internal use in anticipation of future Company growth.  Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring substantial charges.
In December 2024, the Company purchased a new 787,000 square foot facility in Memphis, Tennessee, which will accommodate incremental demand for both BASX and AAON products over the next several years, at the same time providing more geographic diversification across our manufacturing footprint. The purchase price for the facility was approximately $63.4 million.
Our capital expenditure program for 2025 is estimated to be approximately $220.0 million. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring substantial charges. 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The change in cash from financing activities in 2024 is primarily related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to manage our working capital needs, especially strategic purchases of inventory to avoid supply chain delays and the funding of certain capital expenditures, offset by repayments we were able to make due to increased operating results and financial condition.
Additionally, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $108.1 million during 2024 (Note 17).
Commitments and Contractual Agreements
We are occasionally party to short-term, cancellable and occasionally non-cancellable, contracts with major suppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials for use in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments because they meet the normal purchase and normal sales exemption. In 2023, the Company executed a five-year purchase commitment for refrigerants. The Company made payments of $11.7 million and $10.1 million on this contract in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Estimated minimum future payments are $9.1 million, $10.5 million, and $11.2 million, for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. We had no other material contractual purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024.
Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We closely monitor these claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to specific legal proceedings.
32
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We discuss these estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors periodically.
Revenue - 
Due to the highly customized nature of many of the Company’s products and each product not having an alternative use to the Company without incurring significant costs to the Company and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as progress is made toward satisfying the performance obligations of each contract. The measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates, including the determination of whether we should recognize revenue as we perform or upon the completion of our performance obligation, as these determinations impact the timing and amount of our reported revenue.  Costs used in estimating revenue can include direct materials, direct labor, installation, freight and delivery, commissions and royalties depending on the individual performance obligation. Other costs not related to the performance obligation, such as indirect labor and materials, small tools and supplies, operating expenses, field rework and back charges are charged to expense as incurred.
Inventor
y
 - Raw material or component inventory typically transfers from one stage of manufacturing to another where it accumulates additional costs directly incurred with the production of finished goods, including estimated standard labor and overhead costs. Labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing of our products are capitalized into inventory on an estimated standard basis. These include certain direct and indirect costs such as compensation, manufacturing, and facility costs associated with manufacturing support functions. We continually monitor our labor and overhead standard costs to ensure that standard costs reasonably reflect our actual costs and make manual adjusts the value of inventory accordingly. Our manual adjustments from standard to actual labor and overhead costs contain uncertainties that require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including inventory turns, supply usage, manufacturing efficiencies, and historical production costs.
Inventory Reserves
 – We establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes, the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions, the required parts needed for part supply sales and replacement parts, and for estimated shrinkage. Assumptions used to estimate inventory reserves include future manufacturing requirements and industry trends. Evolving technology and changes in  product mix or customer demand can significantly affect the outcome of this analysis. 
Warranty Accrual 
– A provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized. Our product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from the date of shipment for parts only; 18 months for data center cooling solutions and cleanroom systems; an additional four years for compressors; 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers; 25 years on stainless steel heat exchangers; and ten years on gas-fired heat exchangers in our historical RL products. Our warranty policy for the RQ series covers parts for two years from the date of unit shipment. Our warranty policy for the WH and WV Series geothermal/water-source heat pumps covers parts for five years from the date of installation. Warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period, historical warranty trends and associated costs, and any known identifiable warranty issue.
Due to the absence of warranty history on new products, an additional provision may be made for such products. Our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience. Should actual claim rates differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required.
33
Share-Based Compensation
 – We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock awards, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and key employee awards (“Key Employee Awards”) based on their fair values at the time of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of stock options, restricted stock awards, and PSUs. Compensation expense is recognized for the Key Employee Awards on a straight-line basis over the service period when the performance condition is determined to be probable. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value of the PSUs is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Model. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and the Monte Carlo Model requires the input of subjective assumptions such as: the expected volatility, the expected term of the grant, forward-looking market conditions, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield for stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards and Key Employee Awards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the respective grant dates. The fair value of restricted stock awards is reduced for the present value of dividends. 
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
 – Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for the acquired businesses over the fair value of the individual assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for impairment at least annually. We perform our annual assessment of impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and more frequently if circumstances warrant.
To perform this assessment, we first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets does not exceed their carrying amount, we calculate the fair value for the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets and compare the amount to their carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived asset exceeds their carrying amount, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets exceeds their fair value, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are considered to be impaired and the balance is reduced by the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.
We performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2024, to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets. Based on these qualitative assessments, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.
Estimates and assumptions used to perform the impairment evaluation are inherently uncertain and can significantly affect the outcome of the analysis. The estimates and assumptions we use in the annual impairment assessment included macro-industry trends, market participant considerations, historical profitability, including free cash flows, and forecasted multi-year operating results. Changes in operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. 
New Accounting Pronouncements
Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the form of accounting standards updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. 
We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The new guidance is intended to update a variety of disclosure requirements. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
34
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The new guidance improves reportable segment disclosures primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and by requiring current annual disclosures to be provided in interim periods. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard for fiscal year ended 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The new guidance is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.    
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The new guidance requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.
Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and, occasionally, we use cancellable and non-cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months to manage this exposure. 
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of $154.9 million. For each one percentage point increase in the interest rate applicable to our outstanding debt, our annual income before taxes would decrease by approximately $1.5 million.

Opinion on the financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AAON, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Revenue Recognition
As described further in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized net sales of $1,201 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Revenue from certain contracts to design and manufacture highly customized units is recognized on an over time basis, as progress is made toward satisfying the performance obligations of each contract. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to cost and income, and are estimated and recognized by the Company throughout the life of certain contracts.   We identified revenue recognized over time related to certain of the Company’s contracts with customers as a critical audit matter.
The principal consideration for our determination that revenue recognized over time related to certain of the Company’s contracts with customers is a critical audit matter is the high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to over time contracts with customers. 
37
Our audit procedures related to revenue recognized over time related to certain of the Company’s contracts with customers included the following, among others. 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over revenue recognition, including management’s determination of the estimated cost to complete and recorded progress toward fulfillment of the performance obligation. 
•
We tested the appropriateness of over-time revenue recognition for a sample of contracts with customers.
•
We tested the appropriateness of revenue recognition for certain over-time contracts, including agreeing cost inputs to source documents, such as purchase orders, third-party invoices, and shipping documents, and evaluating the estimated costs to complete.  
•
We evaluated estimates made by the Company by analyzing the gross margin on completed contracts compared to historical estimates for those contracts to test the Company’s estimation process.

AAON, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024 

1.  
Business Description
AAON, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which was incorporated on August 18, 1987. Our operating subsidiaries include AAON, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (“AAON Oklahoma”), AAON Coil Products, Inc., a Texas corporation (“AAON Coil Products”), and BASX, Inc., an Oregon corporation (“BASX”) (collectively, the “Company”). The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries.  
We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of premium air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom, and custom rooftop units, data centers cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls.
Inflation and Labor Market
In 2022, raw material and component prices rose, but by 2023, inflation slowed, leading to some stabilization in these prices. Due to our favorable liquidity position, we continue to make strategic purchases of materials when we see opportunities. We continue to manage the increase in the cost of raw materials through price increases for our products. We have also experienced supply chain challenges related to specific manufacturing parts, which we have managed through our strong vendor relationships as well as expanding our list of vendors.
Additionally, we continue to experience challenges in a tight labor market, especially the hiring of both skilled and unskilled production labor. We have implemented the following wage increases to remain competitive and to attract and retain employees:
•
In March 2022, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 
3.0
% increase to wages. 
•
In October 2022, we implemented a cost of living increase of 
3.5
% in place for all employees 
below the SLT level.
•
In March 2023, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 
3.9
% increase to wages.
•
In March 2024, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 
3.3
% increase to wages.
We continue to implement human resource initiatives to retain and attract labor to further increase production capacity. Beginning in 2023, initiatives included changing our employee paid time off policy, historically awarded in arrears at the beginning of each quarter, to accrue ratably over each pay period. Additionally, we enhanced our benefits for short-term disability, life insurance, paid parental leave, and paid military leave.
Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of inflation, supply chain issues and the tight labor market, future disruptions, while temporary, could negatively impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
WH Series and WV Series Water Source Heat Pump Units
As part of the normal course of business, management continually monitors the profitability of the Company’s various product series offerings. During the third quarter of 2022, management made the decision to no longer produce our small packaged geothermal/water-source heat pump units consisting of the WH Series horizontal configuration and WV Series vertical configuration, from one-half to 12 1/2 tons (“WH/WV”). These WH/WV units were produced solely out of the AAON Oklahoma facility. Production of the remaining WH/WV backlog was completed during the second quarter of 2023.
Change in Estimate
During the first quarter of 2022, a review of the Company’s useful lives for certain sheet metal manufacturing equipment at our Longview, Texas facilities resulted in a change in estimate that increased the useful lives from between 10 and 12 years to 15 years. This determination was based on recent and estimated future production levels as well as management's knowledge of the equipment and historical and future use of the equipment. The change in estimate was made prospectively and resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income of $
1.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.
We do not believe the impact of these events had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

2.  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
These financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Our financial statements also consolidate all of our affiliated entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. Because we hold certain rights that give us the power to direct the activities of 
eight
 variable interest entities (“VIEs”) (Note 18) that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses, we have a controlling financial interest in those VIEs.
C
ash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid temporary investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and highly liquid, interest-bearing money market funds. 
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held in a few financial institutions in amounts that exceed the insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. However, management believes that the Company’s counterparty risks are minimal based on the reputation and history of the institutions selected.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash held at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, consists of bank deposits and highly liquid, interest-bearing money market funds held for the purpose of the Company’s qualified New Markets Tax Credit programs (Note 18) to benefit an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations. 
The Company’s restricted cash is held in financial institutions in amounts that exceed the insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. However, management believes that the Company’s counterparty risks are minimal based on the reputation and history of the institutions selected.
Accounts and Note Receivable
Accounts and note receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for credit losses. We generally do not require that our customers provide collateral; however, our billings and customer payment terms can vary based on product type as a way to manage collections risk. The Company determines its allowance for credit losses by considering a number of factors, including the credit risk of specific customers, the customer’s ability to pay current obligations, historical trends, economic and market conditions, and the age of the receivable. Accounts are considered past due when the balance has been outstanding for ninety days past negotiated credit terms. Past-due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for credit losses only after all collection attempts have been exhausted.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Our customers are concentrated primarily in the domestic commercial and industrial new construction and replacement markets. To date, our sales have been primarily to the domestic market, with foreign sales accounting for approximately 
2.5
%, 
3.4
%, and 
3.1
% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
44
For the years-ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Texas AirSystems accounted for approximately 
16.4
%, 
13.8
%, and 
12.4
% of our sales, respectively. Through portfolio groups, Meriton has an ownership interest in Texas AirSystems and certain other of our sales representatives. The aggregate sales percentages through Meriton-affiliated groups that are in addition to Texas AirSystems’ sales for the years-ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 accounted for an additional 
8.0
%, 
2.3
%, and 
1.4
%, respectively. Two other similar groups, Ambient and AIR Control Concepts, share common ownership of some of our other sales representatives through portfolio groups and for the year-ended December 31, 2024, aggregate sales through their portfolio groups accounted for approximately 
14.9
% and 
9.2
% of our sales, respectively. In 2023, aggregate sales for Ambient and AIR Control Concepts accounted for approximately 
11.5
% and 
10.2
% of our sales respectively. Sales through the portfolio groups of either Ambient or AIR Control Concepts did not account for 10% or more of our sales for any years-ended prior to December 31, 2023. No other customers or portfolio groups accounted for more than 10% or more of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, Texas AirSystems accounted for approximately 
10.3
% and 
13.5
%, of our accounts receivable balance, respectively. The aggregate percentages through Meriton-affiliated groups that are in addition to Texas AirSystems’ accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, accounted for an additional 
6.3
% and 
2.0
%, respectively. Two other similar groups, Ambient and AIR Control Concepts, aggregate percentages through their portfolio groups accounted for approximately 
19.3
% and 
6.6
% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024, respectively, and 
16.8
% and 
11.5
% as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, one customer accounted for 
21.1
% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2024. No other customers or portfolio groups accounted for more than 10% or more of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost method.  Cost in inventory includes purchased parts and materials, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead. We establish an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories based on product line changes, the feasibility of substituting parts and the need for supply and replacement parts.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation; except for property, plant, and equipment acquired in a business combination which is recorded at fair value. Repairs and maintenance and any gains or losses on disposition are included in operations.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings and leasehold improvements
3
 - 
40
 years
Machinery and equipment
3
 - 
20
 years
Furniture and fixtures
3
 - 
15
 years
Business Combinations
The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the businesses acquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. The Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after the acquisition closing date. Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of the items. The carrying amount of the Company’s debt, and other payables, approximate their fair values either due to their short-term nature, the variable rates associated with the debt or based on current rates offered to the Company for debt with similar characteristics.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. We use the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes valuation technique inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and (iv) inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Items categorized in Level 3 include the estimated fair values of intangible assets, contingent consideration, and goodwill acquired in a business combination.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
Software Development Costs
We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Internal-use software development costs are capitalized during the application development stage. These capitalized costs are reflected in intangible assets, net and goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The useful life of our internal-use software development costs is generally between 
one
 to 
six years
.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our definite-lived intangible assets include customer relationships, internal-use software and other intellectual property acquired in business combinations or asset acquisition. We amortize our definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. 
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Intellectual property
6
 - 
30
 years
Customer relationships
14
 years
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for the acquired businesses over the fair value of the individual assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill at December 31, 2024, is expected to be tax deductible in future periods. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks, trade names, and internal-use software. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for impairment at least annually. We perform our annual assessment of impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and more frequently if circumstances warrant.
To perform this assessment, we first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets does not exceed their carrying amount, we calculate the fair value for the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets and compare the amount to their carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived asset exceeds 
46
their carrying amount, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets exceeds their fair value, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are considered to be impaired and the balance is reduced by the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.
We performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2024, to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets. Based on these qualitative assessments, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.
Estimates and assumptions used to perform the impairment evaluation are inherently uncertain and can significantly affect the outcome of the analysis. The estimates and assumptions we use in the annual impairment assessment included market participant considerations and future forecasted operating results. Changes in operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests.

Contingent Consideration
As part of the acquisition of BASX (Note

17) in 2021, we agreed to issue shares of the Company’s common stock based on certain milestones in accordance with the acquisition agreement. This contingent consideration is valued at fair value on the acquisition date and is included in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgment, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.
Research and Development
The costs associated with research and development for the purpose of developing and improving new products are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 research and development costs amounted to approximately $
47.3
 million, $
43.7
 million, and $
46.8
 million, respectively.

Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of income. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately $
3.3
 million, $
2.6
 million, and $
2.4
 million, respectively.
Shipping and Handling
We incur shipping and handling costs in the distribution of products sold that are recorded in cost of sales. Shipping charges that are billed to the customer are recorded in revenues and as an expense in cost of sales. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 shipping and handling fees amounted to approximately $
22.0
 million, $
29.0
 million, and $
24.4
 million, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies are reported as an income tax benefit or expense on the statement of income and are treated as discrete items to the income tax provision in the reporting period in which they occur. We establish accruals for unrecognized tax positions when it is more likely than not that our tax return positions may not be fully sustained. The Company records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.
47
Share-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and performance stock units (“PSUs
”
). 
In conjunction with the acquisition of BASX in 2021, we awarded performance awards to key employees (“Key Employee Awards”) of BASX. 

The fair values of stock options are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. 
The fair value of the PSUs is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Model. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and the Monte Carlo Model requires the input of subjective assumptions such as the expected volatility, the expected term of the grant, expected market performance, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield for stock options. The fair va
lue of restricted stock awards and Key Employee Awards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the respective grant dates. 
The fair value of restricted stock awards is reduced for the present value of dividends. The Key Employee Awards and PSUs do not accrue dividends.
Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the related share-based compensation award. Stock options and restricted stock awards, granted to employees, vested at a rate of 
33
% per year. Restricted stock awards granted to directors historically vest over the shorter of directors' remaining elected term or one-third each year.  Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
All share-based compensation awards granted contain a one-year employment requirement (minimum service period) or the entire award is forfeited.  If the employee or director is retirement eligible (as defined by the Long Term Incentive Plans) or becomes retirement eligible during service period of the related share-based compensation award, the service period is the lesser of 1) the grant date (plus one year), if retirement eligible on grant date, or 2) the period between grant date (plus one year) and retirement eligible date. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 
The PSUs cliff vest at the end of their respective service period. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of PSUs. The PSUs are subject to several service and market conditions, as defined by the PSU agreement, which allows the holder to retain a pro-rata amount of awards as a result of certain termination conditions, retirement, change in common control, or death. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
The Key Employee Awards cliff vested on December 31, 2023. Share-based compensation expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the Key Employee Awards as the performance conditions were satisfied. The Key Employee Awards were subject to several service and performance conditions, as defined by the Key Employee Award agreement, which allowed the holder to retain an amount of the awards as a result of certain termination conditions or a change in common control. Forfeitures were accounted for as they occurred.
Derivative Instruments
In the course of normal operations, the Company occasionally enters into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase of raw materials that qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts. Such contracts are exempted from the fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract. The Company does not engage in speculative transactions, nor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Revenue Recognition
Due to the highly customized nature of many of the Company’s products and each product not having an alternative use to the Company without significant costs to the Company, the Company recognizes revenue over time as progress is made toward satisfying the performance obligations of each contract. The Company has formal cancellation policies and generally does not accept returns on these units. As a result, many of the Company’s products do not have an alternative use and an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, and therefore, for these products, we recognize revenue over the time it takes to produce the unit.
Contract costs include direct materials, direct labor, installation, freight and delivery, commissions and royalties. Other costs not related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and materials, small tools and supplies, operating expenses, field rework and back charges are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are estimated and recognized by the Company throughout the life of the contract. The aggregate of costs incurred and income recognized on 
48
uncompleted contracts in excess of billings is shown as a contract asset within our consolidated balance sheets, and the aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs incurred and income recognized is shown as a contract liability within our consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company recognizes revenue, presented net of sales tax, when it satisfies the performance obligation in its contracts.  For certain manufactured equipment contracts and parts sales, the primary performance obligation in such a contract is delivery of the requested manufactured equipment. We satisfy the performance obligation when the control is passed to the customer, generally at time of shipment. Final sales prices are fixed based on purchase orders. 
Sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experiences and current estimates. 
Historically, sales of our products were moderately seasonal with the peak period being May-October of each year due to timing of construction projects being directly related to warmer weather. However, in recent years, given the increases in demand of our product and increases in our backlog, sales have become more constant throughout the year.
Product Warranties
A provision is made for the estimated cost of maintaining product warranties to customers at the time the product is sold based upon historical claims experience by product line. The Company records a liability and an expense for estimated future warranty claims based upon historical experience and management’s estimate of the level of future claims. Changes in the estimated amounts recognized in prior years are recorded as an adjustment to the liability and expense in the current year.
The Company also sells extended warranties on parts for various lengths of time ranging from 
six months
 to 
10
 years. Revenue for these separately priced warranties is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the separately priced warranty period.
Representatives and Third Party Products
We are responsible for billings and collections resulting from all sales transactions, including those initiated by our independent manufacturer representatives (“Representatives”). Representatives are national companies that are in the business of providing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) units and other related products and services to customers. The end user customer orders a bundled group of products and services from the Representative and expects the Representative to fulfill the order. These other related products and services may include controls purchased from another manufacturer to operate the unit, start-up services, and curbs for supporting the unit (“Third Party Products”). All are associated with the purchase of an HVAC unit but may be provided by the Representative or another third party. Only after the specifications are agreed to by the Representative and the customer, and the decision is made to use an AAON HVAC unit, will we receive notice of the order. We establish the amount we must receive for our HVAC unit (“minimum sales price”), but do not control the total order price that is negotiated by the Representative with the end user customer. The Representatives submit the total order price to us for invoicing and collection. The total order price includes our minimum sales price and an additional amount which may include both the Representatives’ fee and amounts due for additional products and services required by the customer. The Company is considered the principal for the equipment we design and manufacture and records that revenue gross. The Company has no control over the Third Party Products to the end customer and the Company is under no obligation related to the Third Party Products. Amounts related to Third Party Products are not recognized as revenue but are recorded as a liability and are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Representatives’ fee and Third Party Products amounts (“Due to Representatives”) are paid only after all amounts associated with the order are collected from the customer. The amount of payments to our Representatives was $
34.0
 million, $
59.2
 million, and $
39.1
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
49
Insurance Reserves
Under the Company’s insurance programs, coverage is obtained for significant liability limits as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is the policy of the Company to self-insure a portion of certain expected losses related primarily to workers’ compensation and medical liability. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liabilities for the claims incurred.
Leases
New leases entered into by the Company are assessed at lease inception for proper lease classification. At December 31, 2024, and 2023, all of our leases are classified as operating leases.
We have entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the rent expense for these short-term leases is not significant. 
As our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate represents the interest rate that we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term in a similar economic environment. 
Expense related to these leases is recognized on straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our leases contain escalating lease payments based on predefined increases. Most leases contain options to renew or terminate. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities reflect only the options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.
The Company’s leases generally require us to pay for insurance, taxes, utilities, and other operating costs. These payments are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability and are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions as needed, but at a minimum on a quarterly basis. The most significant estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, inventory reserves, warranty accrual, income taxes, useful lives of property, plant, and equipment, estimated future use of leased property, share-based compensation, revenue percentage of completion and estimated costs to complete. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Since 2018, the Company has leased the manufacturing, engineering and office space used by our operations in Parkville, Missouri. The lease term is through December 2032.
In November 2022, the Company entered into a lease arrangement for additional storage facilities in Tulsa, Oklahoma to support our operations. The lease added an additional 
198,000
 square feet to our operations. In January 2024, we amended the lease for an additional 
157,550
 square feet for operations and parts distribution. The amended lease term will expire January 2039. 
In July 2023, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a start date of September 2023, for land and approximately 
72,000
 square feet of facilities in Redmond, Oregon to support our manufacturing operations. The lease term will expire November 2033 with additional renewal options.
We also lease 
six
 properties near our Redmond location. In the aggregate, these leases contain approximately

We continuously evaluate our inventory parts and write off inventory when no alternative use can be found. During the third quarter of 2022, we made the decision to no longer produce our small packaged geothermal/water-source heat pump units consisting of the WH Series horizontal configuration and WV Series vertical configuration. As a result, we have increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory and written off certain related components and parts that cannot be used in other products or sold through our parts business.

Debt
On December 16, 2024, we amended our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated November 24, 2021 (as amended, “Amended Loan Agreement”), to include an $
80.0
 million term loan (“Term Loan”). The Amended Loan Agreement provides for a $
200.0
 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and an option to increase the maximum borrowings to $
300.0

The Term Loan is payable in equal monthly installments, plus interest, over 
60
 months, expiring December 16, 2029.  
Interest Rates
Any outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus the applicable margin. The outstanding amount under the Term Loan bears interest at the SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 
0.10
% per annum plus the Applicable Margin.
Applicable margin, ranging from 
1.25
% - 
1.75
%, is determined quarterly based on the Company’s leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from 
1.25
% - 
1.75
%, and a commitment fee, ranging from 
0.10
% - 
0.20
%. The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly based on the Company’s leverage ratio. 
Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Weighted average interest rate of our borrowings outstanding are as follows:

Funds were borrowed on December 16, 2024.  No borrowings outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
If SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Amended Loan Agreement, any outstanding effected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate (“ABR”) loans. ABR loans would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 
0.50
%, or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 
1.00
%. As of December 16, 2024, as defined by the Amended Loan Agreement, if the SOFR cannot be determined any outstanding balance will bear interest at the Prime Rate in effect on such day.
Debt Covenants
At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants as defined by the Amended Loan Agreement. These covenants included a financial covenant that we meet certain parameters related to our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2024, our leverage ratio was 
0.57
 to 1.0, which meets the requirement of not being above 
3

The Company had investment tax credit carryforwards with a valuation allowance reserved against them as we did not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the carryforwards, in part because we generated more credit each year than we were able to utilize. Because the Company will not generate additional excess credits after our 2022 tax year, we will be able to use our credit carryforwards against future taxable income and the related valuation allowance was reversed resulting in a one-time benefit of $
3.1
 million to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we have investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
0.9
 million. These credits have estimated expirations from the year 2039 through 2043.
The Company recorded an excess tax benefit of $
16.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $
8.9
 million and $
3.0
 million during the same periods in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The excess tax benefit is related to the timing of stock option exercises as a result of our high stock price during the year ended December 31, 2024.
In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the tax deduction for covered executives of public companies is limited to $1.0 million per individual. Because of the increase in our stock price and timing of executive stock option exercises this resulted in an increase to the income tax provision of $
4.3
 million and $
3.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
We also earn research and development tax credits as defined under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for the research and development tax credits, we perform annual studies that identify, document, and support eligible expenses related to qualified research and development activities. Eligible expenses include but are not limited to supplies, materials, contractor expenses and internal employee wages.

In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 174, research and development expenses incurred after December 31, 2021, are required to be capitalized and amortized over five years. The amortization requirements for tax purposes is a mid-year convention, meaning that the tax amortization is 10% in the year of acquisition, 20% in the following four years, and 10% in the final year.   
The amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain deductions. These deductions can vary from year to year and, consequently, the amount of income taxes paid in future years will vary from the amounts paid in prior years.
The Company’s estimated annual 2024 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is approximately 
24.7
%. We file income tax returns in the U.S., state and foreign income tax jurisdictions. We are subject to U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years 2021 to present, and to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years 2020 to present. In addition, we are subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years 2020 to present. The Company continues to evaluate its need to file returns in various state jurisdictions. Any interest or penalties would be recognized as a component of income tax expense.

Share-Based Compensation
On May 22, 2007, our stockholders adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, “2007 Plan”) which provided an additional 
5.0
 million shares that could be granted in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance units, and performance awards. Under the 2007 Plan, the exercise price of shares granted may not be less than 
100
% of the fair market value at the date of the grant.
On May 24, 2016, our stockholders adopted the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2016 Plan”) which provides for approximately 
13.4
 million shares, comprised of 
5.1
 million new shares provided for under the 2016 Plan, approximately 
0.6
 million shares that were available for issuance under the previous 2007 Plan that are now authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan, approximately 
3.9
 million shares that were approved by the stockholders on May 15, 2018, and an additional 
3.8
 million shares that were approved by the stockholders on May 12, 2020. 
On May 21, 2024, our stockholders adopted the 2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2024 Plan”) which provides for approximately 
2.7
 million new shares and approximately 
3.7
 million shares that were issued and outstanding under the 2016 Plan (as of May 21, 2024) that are now authorized for issuance under the 2024 Plan. The 
3.7
 million shares issued and outstanding under the 2016 Plan are only eligible for issuance under the 2024 Plan upon forfeiture, expiration, or cancellation.
Under the 2024 Plan and previously under the 2016 Plan (collectively, the “LTIP Plans”), shares can be granted in 
61
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, and other awards. Under the LTIP Plans, the exercise price of shares granted may not be less than 100% of the fair market value at the date of the grant. The LTIP Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or such other committee of the Board of Directors as is designated by the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). Membership on the Committee is limited to independent directors. The Committee may delegate certain duties to one or more officers of the Company as provided in the LTIP Plans. The Committee determines the persons to whom awards are to be made, determines the type, size and terms of awards, interprets the LTIP Plans, establishes and revises rules and regulations relating to the LTIP Plans and makes any other determinations that it believes necessary for the administration of the LTIP Plans. 
Options

PSUs
We have awarded PSUs to certain officers and employees under our LTIP Plans. Unlike our restricted stock awards, these PSUs are not considered legally outstanding and do not accrue dividends during the vesting period. These PSUs vest based on the level of achievement with respect to the Company's total shareholder return (“TSR”) benchmarked against similar companies included in the capital goods sector of the S&P Smallcap 600 Index. The TSR measurement period is 
three years
. At the end of the measurement period, each award will be converted into AAON common stock at 
0
% to 
200
% of the PSUs held, depending on overall TSR as compared to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index benchmark companies.
The total pre-tax compensation cost related to unvested PSUs not yet recognized as of December 31, 2024, is $
4.6
 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 
1.5
 years.

The issuance of the Key Employee Awards was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ending 2021, 2022 and 2023 as defined by the BASX acquisition membership interest purchase agreement (“MIPA Agreement”) and continued employment with the Company. At the end of the earn-out period, ending December 31, 2023, each eligible Key Employee Award vested and was converted into common stock. The fair value of Key Employee Awards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of the key awards was $
53.45
. All pre-tax compensation cost has been recognized as of December 31, 2023.

Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution Plan - 401(k
)

We sponsor a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”). Eligible employees may make contributions in accordance with the Plan and IRS guidelines. In addition to the traditional 401(k), eligible employees are given the option of making an after-tax contribution to a Roth 401(k) or a combination of both. The Plan provides for automatic enrollment and for an automatic increase to the deferral percentage at January 1st of each year and each year thereafter. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a 
6.0
% deferral rate and currently contributing employees’ deferral rates will be increased to 
6.0
% unless their current rate is above 
6.0
% or the employee elects to decline the automatic enrollment or increase. Administrative expenses are paid for by Plan participants. The Company paid 
no
 administrative expenses for the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022.
The Company matches 
175.0
% up to 
6.0
% of employee contributions of eligible compensation. Additionally, Plan participant forfeitures are used to reduce the cost of the Company contributions.

Profit Sharing Bonus Plans

We maintain a discretionary profit sharing bonus plan under which approximately 
8.5
% of pre-tax profit (
10
% prior to January 1, 2024) from the Company is paid to eligible employees on a quarterly basis in order to reward employee productivity. Eligible employees are regular full-time non-exempt employees of the Company who are actively employed and working on the first and last day of the calendar quarter. BASX employees are eligible to participate in the discretionary profit sharing bonus plan on January 1, 2024.
Prior to January 1, 2024, BASX had a separate employee incentive program (“EIP”) under which 
5.0
% of BASX’s pre-tax profit, plus certain add backs, was paid ratably to eligible employees based on days-of-pay during the fiscal year. Eligible employees are regular full-time and part-time employees who have worked during the year and are still employed when the EIP payment is made following the end of the fiscal year, excluding members of BASX’s senior leadership team and any employee-paid commissions or royalties. This incentive program ended December 31, 2023.

Employee Medical Plan

We self-insure for our employees’ health insurance and make medical claim payments up to certain stop-loss amounts. We estimate our self-insurance liabilities using an analysis provided by our claims administrator and our historical claims experience. Eligible employees are regular full-time employees who are actively employed and working. Participants are expected to pay a portion of the premium costs for coverage of the benefits provided under the Plans. In addition, the Company matches 
175.0
% of a participating employee's allowed contributions to a qualified health saving account to assist employees with our health insurance plan deductibles. BASX employees joined the Company's medical plan and benefits on January 1, 2024.
BASX was insured for healthcare coverage through a third party through December 31, 2023. Eligible employees are regular full-time employees who are actively employed and working. Participants are expected to pay a portion of the premium costs for coverage of the benefits provided under the Plans. In addition, the Company contributes certain amounts for BASX’s employees enrolled in a high deductible plan to a qualified health savings account to assist employees with health insurance plan deductibles. This healthcare coverage ended December 31, 2023.

 Effective with the cash dividend declared on March 1, 2023 (paid on March 31, 2023), the Company moved from semi-annual cash dividends to quarterly cash dividends.
We paid cash dividends of $
26.1
 million, $
26.4
 million, and $
22.9
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Stock Split
On July 7, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company’s common stock to be paid in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2023, received 
one
 additional share for every 
two
 shares they held as of that date on August 16, 2023 (ex-dividend date August 17, 2023). Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares (approximately $
0.5
 million). All share and per share information has been updated to reflect the effects of this stock split. 
Contingent Shares Issued in BASX Acquisition 
On December 10, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of BASX. Under the MIPA Agreement, we committed to $
78.0
 million in the aggregate of contingent consideration to the former owners of BASX, which was payable in approximately 
1.56
 million shares of AAON stock, par value of $
0.004
 per share. The shares did not accrue dividends.  
Under the MIPA Agreement, the issuance of shares to the former owners of BASX was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. In March 2024, we issued the remaining 
0.2
 million shares related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2023. As a result of the shares issued in March 2024, the tax basis exceeded the book basis for consideration paid resulting in a deferred tax asset and an increase to additional paid-in capital of 
6.4
 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is expected to be amortized over fifteen years. We previously issued 
0.6
 million shares and 
0.7
 million related to the earn-out milestones for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively.  All shares have been issued as private placements exempt from registration with the SEC under Rule 506(b) and are included in common stock on the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. 
Authorized Shares Outstanding
An amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase its total authorized common shares from 
100,000,000
 to 
200,000,000
 was approved by our stockholders on May 21, 2024, at the Company’s Annual Meeting.  On July 9, 2024, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State to effectuate the increase in authorized shares.

New Markets Tax Credit
2019 New Markets Tax Credit
On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial institution (the “2019 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (“2019 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations (the “2019 Project”). In connection with the 2019 NMTC transaction, the Company received a $
23.0
 million NMTC allocation for the Project and secured low-interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to the 2019 Project.
Upon closing of the 2019 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $
15.9
 million to the 2019 Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of 
25
 years, bearing an interest rate of 
1.0
%. This $
15.9
 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the 2019 Investor was used to make an aggregate $
22.5
 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by equipment at the Company’s Longview, Texas facilities and a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs.
This transaction also includes a put/call feature either of which can be exercised at the end of the 
seven-year
 compliance period. The 2019 Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of which could serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt. The 2019 Investor’s interest of $
6.5
 million is recorded in new markets tax credit obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company incurred approximately $
0.3
 million of debt issuance costs related to the above transactions, which are being amortized over the life of the transaction.  
2023 New Markets Tax Credit
On April 25, 2023, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial institution (the “2023 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (“2023 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations (the “2023 Project”). In connection with the 2023 NMTC transaction, the Company received a $
23.0
 million NMTC allocation for the 2023 Project and secured low-interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to the expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities.
Upon closing of the 2023 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $
16.7
 million to the 2023 Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of 
25
 years, bearing an interest rate of 
1.0
%. This $
16.7
 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the 2023 Investor was used to make an aggregate $
23.8
 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs. The net proceeds from the closing of the 2023 NMTC are included in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets required to be used for the 2023 Project.
This transaction also includes a put/call feature either of which can be exercised at the end of the 
seven-year
 compliance period. The 2023 Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of which could serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt. The 2023 Investor's interest of $
5.8
 million is recorded in new markets tax credit obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company incurred approximately $
0.4
 million of debt issuance costs related to the above transactions, which are being amortized over the life of the transaction.   
2024 New Markets Tax Credit
On February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial institution (the “2024 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (“2024 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in real estate to facilitate 2023 Project. In connection with the 2024 NMTC transaction, the Company received a $
15.5
 million NMTC allocation for the 2023 Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to the expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities.
Upon closing of the 2024 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $
11.0
 million to the 2024 Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of 
25
 years, bearing an interest rate of 
1.0
%. This $
11.0
 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the 2024 Investor was used to make an aggregate 
69
$
16.0
 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs. The net proceeds from the closing of the 2024 NMTC are included in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets required to be used for the 2024 Project.
This transaction also includes a put/call feature that either of which can be exercised at the end of the 
seven-year
 compliance period. The Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of which could serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt.  The 2024 Investor's interest of $
3.8
 million is recorded in new markets tax credit obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company incurred approximately $
0.4
 million of debt issuance costs related to the above transactions, which are being amortized over the life of the transaction.  
The 2019 Investor, 2023 Investor, and 2024 Investor are each subject to 
100
 percent recapture of the 2019, 2023, and 2024 NMTC, respectively, it receives for a period of 
seven years
, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations in the event that the financing facility of the Borrower under the transaction (AAON Coil Products, Inc.) becomes ineligible for NMTC treatment per the Internal Revenue Code requirements. The Company is required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the 2019 NMTC arrangements, 2023 NMTC arrangements, and 2024 NMTC arrangements, respectively.   Noncompliance with applicable requirements could result in the 2019 and/or 2023 and/or 2024 Investors' projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, require the Company to indemnify the 2019 Investor, 2023 Investor, and 2024 Investor for any loss or recapture of the 2019 NMTC, 2023 NMTC, and 2024 NMTC, respectively, related to the financing until such time as the recapture provisions have expired under the applicable statute of limitations. The Company does not anticipate any credit recapture will be required in connection with any of these financing arrangements.
The 2019 Investor, 2023 Investor, and 2024 Investor and its majority-owned community development entity are considered VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Because the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, they have been included in the consolidated financial statements. There are no other assets, liabilities or transactions in these VIEs outside of the financing transactions executed as part of the 2019 NMTC, 2023 NMTC, or 2024 NMTC arrangements, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies
Havtech Litigation
On January 24, 2022, one of the Company’s former independent sales representative firms, Havtech, LLC (and its affiliate, Havtech Parts Division, LLC, collectively “Plaintiffs”), filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Maryland (
Havtech, LLC, et al., v. AAON, Inc., et al.
). The Complaint challenged the Company’s termination of its business relationship with Plaintiffs. The Company removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (Northern Division) and moved to dismiss the Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (“First Amended Complaint”) was entered by the court on July 28, 2022. The First Amended Complaint asserts that the Company improperly terminated Plaintiffs and seeks damages alleged to be no less than $
48.6
 million, plus fees and costs. The Company filed its Answer to First Amended Complaint on January 31, 2023.
On September 28, 2023, the parties attended a court-ordered settlement conference and agreed to resolve the case for $
7.5
 million. A settlement agreement was entered into on October 25, 2023 and the case has been dismissed with prejudice. The settlement of $
7.5
 million has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of income. The final payment was made on October 26, 2023.
Other Matters
The Company is involved from time to time in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business arising from various matters, including alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, environmental, regulatory, personal injury, intellectual property, employment, tax and other laws. We closely monitor these claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. We do not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We are occasionally party to short-term, cancellable and occasionally non-cancellable, fixed-price contracts with major suppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts. We expect to receive delivery of raw 
70
materials for use in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments because they meet the normal purchase and normal sales exemption. We had no material contractual purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024, except as noted below.
In 2023, the Company executed a five-year purchase commitment for refrigerants. In 2024 and 2023, the Company made payments of $
11.7
 million and $
10.1
 million on this contract, respectively. Estimated minimum future payments are $
9.1
 million, $
10.5
 million, and $
11.2
 million for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. We had no other material contractual purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of accounting standards updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The new guidance is intended to update a variety of disclosure requirements. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The new guidance improves reportable segment disclosures primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and by requiring current annual disclosures to be provided in interim periods. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard for fiscal year ended 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The new guidance is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.    
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The new guidance requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

Earnings Per Share
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share assumes the conversion of all potentially dilutive securities and is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted stock awards.

Segments
The Company has determined that it has 
three
 reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. 
AAON Oklahoma:
 AAON Oklahoma engineers, manufactures and sells semi-custom and custom HVAC systems, designs and manufactures controls solutions, and sells aftermarket parts to customers through retail part stores and online. AAON Oklahoma includes the operations of our Tulsa, Oklahoma, Memphis, Tennessee and Parkville, Missouri manufacturing facilities, two retail locations, and the Norman Asbjornson Innovation Center (“NAIC”) research and development laboratory accredited by the Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc. (“AMCA”). 
With the NAIC, a world-class research and development (“R&D”) laboratory in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our products are continuously tested under a variety of extreme environmental conditions to ensure they deliver the ultimate performance, efficiency, and value.
Also located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our cutting-edge Exploration Center showcases the engineering, design attributes, and premium build quality of our equipment side-by-side the market alternatives.
AAON Coil Products: 
AAON Coil Products engineers and manufactures a selection of our semi-custom, and custom HVAC systems as well as a variety of heating and cooling coils to be used in HVAC systems, mostly for the benefit of AAON Oklahoma, AAON Coil Products, and BASX. AAON Coil Products consists of operations at our Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities. BASX branded products are also manufactured in Longview.
BASX: 
BASX engineers, manufactures, and sells an array of custom, high-performance cooling solutions for the rapidly growing hyperscale data center market, ventilation solutions for cleanroom environments in the bio-pharmaceutical, semiconductor, medical and agriculture markets, and highly custom, air handlers and modular solutions for a vast array of markets. BASX consists of operations at our Redmond, Oregon manufacturing facilities.
The Company’s chief decision maker (“CODM”), our CEO, allocates resources and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment’s net sales, cost of sales, and gross profit directly attributable to our segments. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.
Due to the integrated nature of our Company as well as the increasing production of both AAON and BASX branded products across different segments, other costs and expenses, such as selling, general and administrative including corporate expense, are evaluated and resources allocated at a consolidated level. 
The following table summarizes certain financial data related to our segments and significant segment expenses and other segment items regularly reviewed by our CODM. Transactions between segments are recorded based on prices negotiated between the segments. The cost of sales and gross profit amounts shown below are presented after elimination entries.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.
(a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. 
Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2024, to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
(b) 

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In making our assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
. Based on our assessment, our management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Item 9A of this report on Form 10-K.
(c)  
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
AAON, Inc.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of AAON, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
