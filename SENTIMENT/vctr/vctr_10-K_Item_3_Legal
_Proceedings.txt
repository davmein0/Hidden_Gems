Item 3. Legal
 Proceedings.

On August 20, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Preliminary Proxy Statement, and on September 6, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in relation to Amundi contributing to Victory all of the shares of Amundi US, resulting in Victory acquiring Amundi US and Amundi US becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory. As of December 31, 2024, two complaints have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County by purported Victory stockholders against Victory and the members of the Victory board of directors (the “Board”) in connection with the Contribution: Kent v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al., Index No. 654929/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) and Lawrence v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al., Index No. 654920/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) (collectively, the “Stockholder Litigation”). The complaints in the Stockholder Litigation include allegations that, among other things, the defendants caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement with the SEC relating to the proposed Contribution and assert claims for alleged negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence under New York common law.  Additionally, since the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement, Victory received five demand letters from purported Victory stockholders alleging similar insufficiencies in the disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and/or the Proxy Statement (such letters, the “Demand Letters,” and together with the Stockholder Litigation, the “Litigation Matters”).

The plaintiffs in the Stockholder Litigation seek various remedies, which include, among other things: (i) enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed Contribution until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the Proxy Statement; (ii) in the event that the proposed Contribution is consummated, rescinding it or awarding actual and punitive damages to the plaintiffs; (iii) awarding the plaintiffs fees and expenses in connection with the Stockholder Litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses; and (iv) granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.

Victory believes that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply with applicable laws, and that no further disclosures are required to supplement the Proxy Statement under applicable laws. Victory specifically denies all allegations in the Litigation Matters.

We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters or estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss, if any. Although the proceedings are subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process and the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, we intend to vigorously defend these cases. In addition to those items disclosed above, we are, from time to time, subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business.

Each year, since the commencement of cash dividends in 2019, the Company has increased the per-share amount of the quarterly cash dividends distributed to shareholders.

Holders of restricted stock awards on the Company’s Common Stock that are unvested at the time quarterly dividends are declared are entitled to be paid these dividends as and when the restricted stock vests. Potential future dividend payments will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon then‑existing conditions, including capital requirements to execute our growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition, projected cash flow, and terms associated with our current credit facility or any future financing. Potential increases to the Company’s cash dividend rate will be assessed annually.

Overview

Our Business – 
Victory is a diversified global asset management firm with total client assets of $176.1 billion, assets under management of $171.9 billion and other assets of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Company operates a next-generation business model combining boutique investment qualities with the benefits of an integrated, centralized operating and distribution platform.

Victory Capital provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors with 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform. Victory Capital offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products (“VIPs”), alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. Victory Capital’s strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) and unified managed accounts (“UMAs”) through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts (“CITs”), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). As of December 31, 2024, our Franchises and our Solutions Platform collectively managed a diversified set of 124 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients and direct investors.

Franchises –
 Our Franchises are largely operationally integrated but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates. Our largely integrated model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities.

Solutions –
 Our Solutions Platform consists of multi‑asset, multi-manager, quantitative, rules-based, factor-based, and customized portfolios. These strategies are designed to achieve specific return characteristics, with products that include values-based and thematic outcomes and exposures. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds, UMA accounts, and rules-based and active ETFs under our VictoryShares ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing, and operational support functions.

Professionals within our institutional and retail distribution channels, direct investor business and marketing organization sell our products through our centralized distribution model. Our institutional sales team focuses on cultivating relationships with institutional consultants, who account for the majority of the institutional market, as well as asset allocators seeking sub-advisers. Our retail sales team offers intermediary and retirement platform clients, including broker-dealers, retirement platforms and RIA networks, mutual funds and ETFs as well as SMAs through wrap fee programs and access to our investment models through UMAs. Our direct investor business serves the investment needs of individual clients.

We have grown our total client assets from $17.9 billion following the management-led buyout with Crestview GP in August 2013 to $176.1 billion at December 31, 2024. We attribute this growth to our success in sourcing acquisitions and evolving them into organic growers, generating strong investment returns, and developing institutional, retail, and direct investor channels with deep penetration.

Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to measure the operating profitability of the business. These measures eliminate the impact of one‑time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. These measures are explained in more detail and reconciled to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP in “Supplemental Non‑GAAP Financial Information.”

(2)
Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.

(3)
Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step‑up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15‑year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step‑up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Assets Under Management

Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re‑open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions Platform, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle.

Valuation of Assets Under Management

The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company’s other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.

For certain alternative investment vehicles, including the NEC funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed. The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds’ net asset values or the total fair value of the funds’ portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees. For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company’s total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation.

Table of Contents

GAAP Results of Operations

Our GAAP revenues principally consist of: (i) investment management fees, which are based on our overall weighted average fee rate charged to our clients and our level of AUM and (ii) fund administration and distribution fees, which are asset‑based fees earned from open‑end mutual funds for administration and distribution services. Fund administration and fund distribution fees also include fund transfer agent fees, which are based on a contractual rate applied to average AUM or the number of accounts in these funds.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service.

Investment Management Fees –
 Investment management fees are earned from managing clients’ assets. Our investment management fee revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the total value of our AUM, the composition of AUM across investment strategies and vehicles, changes in the investment management fee rates on our products and the extent to which we enter into fee arrangements that differ from our standard fee schedule as well as the extent to which our fund expenses exceed fund caps. Investment management fees are earned based on a percentage of AUM as delineated in the respective investment management agreements. Our investment management fees are calculated based on daily average AUM, monthly average AUM or point in time AUM.

Fund Administration and Distribution Fees –
 Fund administration fees are primarily asset‑based fees earned from open‑end funds for administration services. Fund administration fees fluctuate based on the level of average open‑end fund AUM and the fee rates charged for these services.

Fund distribution fees are asset‑based fees earned from open‑end funds for distribution services. Fund distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of average open‑end fund AUM and the composition of those assets across share classes that pay varying levels of fund distribution fees.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis. VCS has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. VCS is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of VCS’s revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties.

Fund transfer agent fees are earned for providing mutual fund shareholder services. Transfer agent fees fluctuate based on the level of average AUM and the number of accounts in the Victory Funds III.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. We are the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the Victory Funds III and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

GAAP Expenses

Our GAAP expenses principally consist of: (i) personnel compensation and benefits; (ii) distribution and other asset‑based expenses; (iii) general and administrative expenses; (iv) depreciation and amortization charges; and (v) acquisition‑related expenses comprising of changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments and restructuring and acquisition costs.

61

Table of Contents

Personnel Compensation and Benefits –
 Personnel compensation and benefits is our most significant category of expense. Personnel compensation and benefits consists of (i) salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits, (ii) incentive compensation, (iii) sales‑based compensation, (iv) compensation expense related to equity awards granted to employees and directors and (v) acquisition‑related compensation in the form of cash retention bonuses and certain transaction-related compensatory payment arrangements.

Incentive compensation is the largest component of the total compensation of our employees. The aggregate amount of cash incentive compensation is funded by a pool that is based on a percentage of total Company earnings (before taking into account incentive compensation). This incentive pool is used to pay the investment teams a percentage of the revenue earned by their respective Franchise on a quarterly basis. This incentive pool is also used to pay incentive compensation to senior management and other non‑investment employees on an annual basis. Incentive compensation paid to senior management and to other non‑investment employees is discretionary and subjectively determined based on Company and individual performance and the total amount of the incentive compensation pool.

Distribution and Other Asset‑based Expenses – 
Distribution and other asset‑based expenses consists of: (i) broker‑dealer distribution fees and platform distribution fees and (ii) sub‑administration, sub-transfer agent, sub‑advisory expenses and middle‑office expenses.

Broker‑dealer distribution fees are paid by VCS as the broker‑dealer for the Victory Funds to third‑party distributors. The Victory Funds pay VCS for distribution services and VCS, in turn, pays third‑party distributors.

Platform distribution fees are paid by VCM as the investment adviser to the Victory Funds. Platform distribution fees are paid to financial advisors, retirement plan providers and intermediaries for servicing and administering accounts invested in shares of the Victory Funds. Distribution fees typically vary based on the level of AUM and the composition of those assets across share classes.

Sub‑administration, sub-transfer agent, sub‑advisory and middle‑office expenses consist of fees paid to our sub‑administrators of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares, fees paid to our sub-transfer agent for the Victory Funds III, fees paid to sub‑advisers on certain Victory Funds and fees paid to vendors to which we outsource middle‑office functions.

•
VCM acts as the administrator to the Victory Funds and VictoryShares. VCM has hired a sub‑administrator, the fees for which are captured in sub‑administration expense. As administrator, VCM supervises the operations of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares, including the services provided by the sub‑administrators. The sub‑administrators are paid through a contractual arrangement based on a percentage of the average fund AUM.

•
VCTA acts as the transfer agent to the Victory Funds III. VCTA has hired a sub-transfer agent, the fees for which are captured in sub-administration expense. As transfer agent, VCTA oversees the services provided by the sub-transfer agent. The sub-transfer agent is paid through a contractual arrangement based on a percentage of average fund AUM.

•
VCM, as the investment adviser for the Victory Funds, has hired unaffiliated sub‑advisers to manage funds for which we do not have in‑house capabilities. The fees paid to the sub‑advisers are contractual based on a percentage of assets that they manage or based upon a percentage of revenue.

•
We have outsourced middle‑office operations to achieve a scalable operational infrastructure that utilizes a variable‑cost model. We have selected to partner with top‑tier vendors who perform trade operations, portfolio accounting and performance measurement with oversight from our operations team. The fees paid to these vendors are variable and structured based on the number of accounts, assets and specific services performed.

General and Administrative Expenses – 
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of investment research and technology costs, professional and marketing fees, travel, rent and insurance expenses.

62

Table of Contents

Depreciation and Amortization – 
Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of the depreciation of property and equipment as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles that have a definite life. These intangibles include customer relationships, investment advisory contracts, intellectual property and non‑compete clauses acquired in connection with a business or asset acquisition. Both depreciation and amortization are recorded ratably over the assets’ useful lives.

Acquisition‑Related Costs – 
Acquisition‑related costs include legal fees, advisory services, mutual fund proxy voting costs and other one‑time expenses related to acquisitions.

Restructuring and Integration Costs – 
Restructuring and integration costs include costs incurred in connection with business combinations, including the change in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments, asset purchases and changes in business strategy. These include severance expenses related to one‑time benefit arrangements, contract termination and other costs to integrate investment platforms, products and personnel into existing systems, processes and service provider arrangements and restructuring the business to capture operating expense synergies.

Other non‑operating items of income and expense consist of: (i) interest income and other income (expense); (ii) interest expense and other financing costs; (iii) loss on debt extinguishment; and (iv) income tax expense.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense) – 
Interest income and other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, gains (losses) on investments and dividend income on investments.

Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs – 
Interest expense and other financing costs consists primarily of interest expense attributable to long‑term debt. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment – 
Loss on debt extinguishment consists of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount as a result of debt refinancing, the acceleration of the paydown of debt principal and debt repurchased and retired in open market transactions.

Income Tax Expense – 
The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state and local taxes, and foreign income taxes payable by certain of our subsidiaries. The effective tax rate is primarily driven by state and local taxes and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The portion of the effective income tax rate attributable to state and local income taxes varies from year to year depending on amounts of income apportioned to each jurisdiction, whether we file income tax returns on a unitary or separate return basis and with changes in tax laws.

Income Tax Expense

67

Table of Contents

2024 compared to 2023 –
 Our effective tax rate was flat at 22.7% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, to the audited financial statements for further details on income taxes.

2023 compared to 2022 –
 Our effective tax rate increased 1.4% from 21.3% in 2022 to 22.7% in 2023. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, to the audited financial statements for further details on income taxes.

Effects of Inflation

Inflation did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations. Inflationary pressures can result in increases to our cost structure. Certain large expense components such as compensation and distribution expenses are predominately variable and move in tandem with revenues. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through price increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. In addition, the value of the fixed income assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of AUM could lead to reduced revenues as investment management fees are generally earned as a percentage of AUM.

Supplemental Non‑GAAP Financial Information

We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses non‑GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business. Non‑GAAP financial measures are used to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP results alone. Due to our acquisitive nature, there are a number of acquisition and restructuring related expenses included in GAAP measures that we believe distort the underlying economics of our organization and we believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. We have included these non‑GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of our Company.

Non‑GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non‑GAAP measures may differ from similar measures at other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify these measures. Specifically, we make use of the non‑GAAP financial measures “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Net Income.”

(10)
Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from acquisitions in which we received a step‑up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15‑year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step‑up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant economic benefit.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Contractual Obligations

Sources and Uses of Cash –
 We generate strong cash flows from operations that allow us to meet our cash requirements. Our primary uses of cash include: (i) repayment of our debt obligations, (ii) funding of acquisitions, (iii) payment of contingent consideration for previous acquisitions, and (iv) working capital needs. Cash flows from operations also allow us to meet certain other cash uses such as quarterly cash dividends and

2019 Credit Agreement

On July 1, 2019, concurrent with the USAA AMCO Acquisition, the Company entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement, repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement (the “2018 Credit Agreement”), and terminated the 2018 Credit Agreement.

The 2019 Credit Agreement was entered into among Victory, as borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company obtained a seven-year term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the “2019 Term Loans”) and established a five-year revolving credit facility (which was unfunded as of the closing date) with aggregate commitments of $100.0 million (with a $10.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit).

The obligations of the Company under the 2019 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company’s domestic subsidiaries (other than VCS) (the “Guarantors”) and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to certain customary exceptions.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that affect, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge or dissolve, make investments, dispose of assets, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make distributions and dividends and prepayments of junior indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, amend documentation governing junior indebtedness, modify its fiscal year and modify its organizational documents, subject to customary exceptions, thresholds, qualifications and “baskets.” In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement contains a financial performance covenant, requiring a maximum first lien leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 35.0% of the commitments thereunder (excluding certain letters of credit), of no greater than 3.80 to 1.00.

As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with its financial performance covenant.

First Amendment

Amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement originally accrued interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) plus a margin of 3.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.25%.

Table of Contents

On January 17, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank.

Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company refinanced the 2019 Term Loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $952.0 million (the “2020 Term Loans”). The 2020 Term Loans provided for substantially the same terms as the 2019 Term Loans, including the same maturity date of July 1, 2026, except that the 2020 Term Loans reduced the applicable margin on LIBOR by 75 basis points, resulting in an applicable margin on LIBOR under the 2020 Term Loans of 2.50%.

Second Amendment

On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the 2020 Term Loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the “Repriced Term Loans”). The Repriced Term Loans provided for substantially the same terms as the 2020 Term Loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans reduced the applicable margin on LIBOR by 25 basis points, resulting in an applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans of 2.25%.

Third Amendment

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the “2021 Incremental Term Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.

The 2021 Incremental Term Loans will mature in December 2028 and, until the Fourth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, accrued interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%.

Original issue discount was $2.5 million for the 2021 Incremental Term Loans. The Company incurred a total of $9.1 million of other third party costs related to the 2021 Incremental Term Loans, which were recorded as term loan debt issuance costs.

Fourth Amendment

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on its debt from LIBOR to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate from the Fourth Amendment.

The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment’s effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company’s term loans. The Company has continued to elect the three-month Term SOFR rate for all of the term loans outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement since executing the Fourth Amendment.

Fifth Amendment

On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $100.0 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 0.50% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred $1.0 million in upfront fees, arranger fees and other third party costs related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, which were recorded to revolving credit facility debt issuance cost in other assets.

On July 1, 2024, the Company executed an agency succession agreement, by and among Barclays Bank PLC as the resigning administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2019 Credit Agreement and Royal Bank of Canada, as the successor administrative agent and collateral agent.

2020 Swap Transaction

On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap.

On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap (“the Swap Amendment”) to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $450 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $450 million of the Company’s outstanding term loan debt through July 1, 2026 changed from 3.215% to 3.149% as a result of the Swap Amendment.

On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap ("Swap Termination Agreement"). The Swap Termination Agreement was effective on October 30, 2023. Under the Swap Termination Agreement, the Swap counterparty agreed to pay the Company $43.4 million in cash, which was comprised of the $45.8 million value of the Swap on the termination date inclusive of $1.4 million of interest receivable less $2.4 million in swap unwind costs.

As a result of the Swap Termination Agreement, the Company recorded a $44.4 million deferred gain in AOCI, before tax, replacing the $44.4 million fair value of the Swap in AOCI, before tax. The deferred gain on the Swap monetization is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $16.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in amortization of deferred gain on Swap monetization. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $24.9 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax. The Swap unwind costs of $2.4 million were recorded in general and administrative costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap.

Contingent Consideration

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $139.9 million and $217.2 million, respectively, in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next one to three years resulting from the WestEnd Acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an increases of $2.7 million and $14.5 million, respectively in contingent payment liabilities associated WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded no activity and an increase of $8.7 million, respectively, in contingent payment liabilities associated with the USAA AMCO Acquisition.

Advertising and Marketing Costs

In December 2022, the Company entered into a long-term partnership with Spurs Sports & Entertainment and executed naming rights and partnership agreements for the team’s new performance center. The agreements, which end in 2033, grant the Company exclusive naming rights, sponsorship, signage, advertising and other promotional rights and benefits for the new performance center.

Payments made under the agreements are deferred and expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. The related advertising and marketing expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of amounts paid less amortized expense are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets when cumulative payments exceed amortized expense and in other liabilities when amortized expense exceeds cumulative payments.

Capital Requirements

VCS is a registered broker‑dealer subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Exchange Act, which requires maintenance of certain minimum net capital levels. In addition, we have certain non‑U.S.

Operating Activities

2024 compared to 2023 – 
Cash provided by operating activities was $340.0 million in 2024, compared to $330.3 million in 2023. The $9.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $75.7 million increase in net income partially offset by the combination of a $31.2 million decrease in working capital and a $34.8 million decrease in non-cash items.

2023 compared to 2022 – 
Cash provided by operating activities was $330.3 million in 2023, compared to $335.2 million in 2022. The $4.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $62.4 million decrease in net income partially offset by the combination of a $19.2 million increase in working capital and a $38.3 million increase in non-cash items.

Investing Activities

2024 compared to 2023 –
 Cash used in investing activities decreased by $3.9 million to $4.0 million in 2024, from $7.8 million in 2023 primarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment.

2023 compared to 2022 –
 Cash used in investing activities increased by $1.5 million to $7.8 million in 2023, from $6.3 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in net trading activity.

Financing Activities

2024 compared to 2023 –
 Cash used in financing activities increased $95.6 million to $332.8 million in 2024 from $237.1 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to payment of consideration for acquisition and repayment of long-term senior debt partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of Common Stock. Cash used in payment of consideration for acquisition, repurchases of our Common Stock, payment of dividends, repayment of long-term senior debt, and payment of taxes related to settlement of equity awards totaled $80.0 million, $103.6 million, $101.1 million, $29.5 million and $26.4 million, respectively, during 2024.

2023 compared to 2022 –
 Cash used in financing activities decreased $123.1 million to $237.1 million in 2023 from $360.2 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to no term loan prepayments in 2023 partially offset by increases in repurchases of Common Stock and payment of dividends. Cash used in repurchases of our Common Stock, payment of dividends and payment of taxes related to settlement of equity awards totaled $139.3 million, $85.4 million, and $18.7 million, respectively, during 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the audited consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, our estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, information from third-party valuation professionals and various other assumptions, giving due consideration to materiality. We

73

Table of Contents

consider the accounting policy discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements. This significant accounting policy is described more fully in Note 2, Accounting Policies, to the audited consolidated financial statements.

Contingent Consideration Payable 
for Acquisition of Business
 –
 We recognize and measure contingent consideration liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition date using an option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation. These valuations require significant estimates and judgments related to the net revenue 5 year average annual growth rate, market price of risk adjustment for revenue (continuous), revenue volatility and  discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is remeasured at each reporting period, generally using the same methodology used to determine the acquisition date fair value. We typically utilize an independent valuation expert to assist with these valuations. Any change in the fair value estimate subsequent to the acquisition date is recorded in the earnings of that period.

Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitativ
e Disclosures Regarding Market Risk.

Market Risk
 – 
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further.

The value of our AUM was approximately $172 billion at December 31, 2024. A 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $91.2 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 53 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds and USAA Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $103.2 million at the Victory Funds’ and USAA Funds’ aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024. If the same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $72.2 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 42 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024.

As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate‑level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues.

Exchange Rate Risk
 – 
A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non‑U.S. currencies, or may implement their own

74

Table of Contents

hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio’s exposure to non‑U.S. currency.

We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 11% of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately $1.9 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately $10.0 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 53 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024.

We operate in several foreign countries and incur operating expenses associated with these operations. In addition, we have revenue and revenue-sharing arrangements that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies. We do not believe foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk
 – 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On February 18, 2021, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. On October 30, 2023, the Company decided to monetize the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap, which was effective on October 30, 2023. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At December 31, 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to Note 11, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding as of such date and the applicable interest rate.

Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1. Organization and Nature of Business
Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the “Company,” “Victory,” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us,” and “our”), was formed on February 13, 2013 for the purpose of acquiring Victory Capital Management Inc. (“VCM”) and Victory Capital Services, Inc. (“VCS”), formerly known as Victory Capital Advisers, Inc., which occurred on August 1, 2013. On February 12, 2018, the Company completed the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of its common stock, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “VCTR.”
Victory provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors. With 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform, the Company offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products (“VIPs”), alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. The Company’s strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) and unified managed accounts (“UMAs”) through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts (“CITs”), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS").
VCM is a registered investment adviser and provides mutual fund administrative services for the Victory Portfolios, the Victory Portfolios II and Victory Portfolios III, and Victory Variable Insurance Funds (collectively, the “Victory Funds”), that are families of open-end mutual funds, VictoryShares (the Company’s ETF brand) and the USAA 529 Education Savings Plan. Additionally, VCM employs all of the Company’s United States (U.S.) investment professionals across its Franchises and Solutions, which are not separate legal entities. VCM’s wholly-owned subsidiaries include RS Investment Management (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., RS Investments (UK) Limited, and NEC Pipeline LLC. VCM’s other wholly-owned subsidiary, RS Investments (HK) Limited, ceased operations in May 2023, and was deregistered and dissolved in May 2024.
VCS is registered with the SEC as an introducing broker-dealer and serves as distributor and underwriter for the Victory Funds, and for municipal fund securities issued by the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund under the USAA 529 Education Savings Plan. VCS offers brokerage services to individual investors through an open architecture brokerage platform launched in April 2023. VCS also serves as the placement agent for certain private funds managed by VCM.

On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the “USAA AMCO Acquisition” or “USAA AMCO”) of USAA Asset Management Company and Victory Capital Transfer Agency, Inc. (“VCTA”), formerly known as the USAA Transfer Agency Company d/b/a USAA Shareholder Account Services. The USAA AMCO Acquisition included USAA’s mutual fund and ETF businesses and its 529 Education Savings Plan. VCTA is registered with the SEC as a transfer agent for the Victory Portfolios III.

On November 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 
100
% of the equity interests in New Energy Capital Partners (“NEC”). Founded in 2004 and based in Hanover, New Hampshire, NEC is an alternative asset management firm focused on debt and equity investments in clean energy infrastructure projects and companies 
through private closed-end funds (the “NEC Funds”).

On December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition (“WestEnd Acquisition”) of 
100
% of the equity interests in WestEnd Advisors, LLC (“WestEnd”). Founded in 2004, and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, WestEnd is an ETF strategist advisor that provides financial advisors with a turnkey, core model allocation strategy for either a holistic solution or complementary source of alpha.
On July 8, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with Amundi Asset Management S.A.S ("Amundi') and certain other parties therein whereby Amundi’s U.S. business (“Amundi US” formerly Pioneer Investments) will be combined into the Company. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Amundi US becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory in exchange for a 
26.1
% economic stake in the Company composed of newly issued shares of Victory's common stock (the "Common Stock") representing 
4.9
% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, after giving effect to that issuance, and the balance in newly issued shares of the Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock"). The parties have also entered into reciprocal 
15-year
 distribution 
agreements, which will be effective upon closing of the transaction. The closing

81

Table of Contents

of 
the contemplated transaction, expected by the end of the first quarter of 2025, is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. On October 11, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its shareholders and the Company’s shareholders voted to approve the issuance of the Common Stock, the Preferred Stock and the other proposals set forth in the definitive proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”), filed on September 6, 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in each case in connection with the Contribution.

NOTE 
2. Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Company and its wholly‑owned subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and balances. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The Company evaluates entities in which it invests and investment funds that it sponsors to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in these entities and is required to consolidate them. A controlling financial interest generally exists if (i) the Company holds greater than 
50
% voting interest in entities controlled through voting interests or if (ii) the Company has the ability to direct significant activities of a fund not controlled through voting interests (a variable interest entity or VIE) and the obligation to absorb losses of and/or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The Company’s involvement with non‑consolidated sponsored investment funds that are considered VIEs include providing investment advisory, fund administration, fund compliance, fund transfer agent, fund distribution services and other management services and/or holding a minority interest. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's investments in and maximum risk of loss related to unconsolidated sponsored VIE investment funds totaled $
35.1
 million and $
31.7
 million, respectively which are included in investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial support to these entities outside the ordinary course of business, which includes assuming operating expenses of funds for competitive or contractual reasons through fee waivers and fund expense reimbursements. The Company does not consolidate the sponsored investment funds in which it has an equity investment as it holds a minority interest, does not direct significant activities of these funds and does not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to these funds.
Upon the completion of the NEC Acquisition on November 1, 2021, VCM became the manager of certain general partner entities associated with the acquired NEC Funds. The Company has no equity investment in these general partner entities, which are non-consolidated VIEs, and has no share of these general partner entities’ income or losses.

The Company owned a 
15
% equity interest in Alderwood Partners LLP (“Alderwood”) from September 20, 2020 to July 31, 2022, when the Company retired as a member of Alderwood. The Company analyzed its investment in Alderwood under the voting interest model and determined that it did not have a controlling financial interest. The Company accounted for its Alderwood investment using the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 13, Equity Method Investment, for additional information on Alderwood.
The Company applies the equity method of accounting to investments where it does not hold a controlling equity interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters. In the event that management identifies an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of an equity method investment to an amount below its carrying value, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions

82

Table of Contents

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and the differences may be material.
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s revenue includes fees earned from providing investment management services, fund administration services, fund compliance, fund transfer agent services and fund distribution services.
Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

For further information on the Company’s various revenue streams, refer to Note 3, Revenue.
Distribution and Other Asset‑Based Expenses
Distribution and other asset‑based expenses include (i) broker dealer distribution fees, (ii) platform distribution fees, (iii) sub‑administration, third party sub-transfer agent and sub‑advisory expenses. These expenses are accrued on a monthly basis and are generally calculated as a percentage of AUM and vary as levels of AUM change from inflows, outflows and market movement and with the number of days in the month.
Also included in distribution and other asset‑based expenses are middle office expenses. Middle office expenses are accrued on a monthly basis and vary with changes in mutual fund, institutional and wrap separate account AUM levels, the number of accounts and volume of account transaction activity.
Restructuring and Integration Costs
In connection with business combinations, asset purchases and changes in business strategy, the Company incurs costs integrating investment platforms, products and personnel into existing systems, processes and service provider arrangements and restructuring the business to capture operating expense synergies.

These costs include severance‑related expenses related to one‑time benefit arrangements and contract termination costs. A liability for restructuring costs is recognized only after management has developed a formal plan to which it has committed. The costs included in the restructuring liability are those costs that are either incremental or incurred as a direct result of the plan or are the result of a continuing contractual obligation with no continuing economic benefit to the Company and include penalties incurred to cancel the contractual obligation. Severance expense is recorded when management has committed to a plan for a reduction in workforce, the plan has been communicated to employees and it is unlikely that there will be significant changes to the plan.
Contract termination liabilities are recorded for contract termination costs when the Company terminates a contract or stops using the product or service covered by the contract. Contract termination liabilities are recognized and measured at fair value. Contract termination costs are recorded in restructuring and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks, money market accounts and funds and short‑term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. For the Company and certain subsidiaries, cash deposits at a financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
Investments
Investments in Proprietary Funds
Investments in proprietary funds include investments in affiliated mutual funds and are recorded in investments in proprietary funds, at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized in

83

Table of Contents

other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Dividend income is accrued on the declaration date and is included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Transactions are recorded on a trade‑date basis.
The Company periodically reviews each individual security that is in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is other‑than‑temporary. Factors that are considered in determining whether other‑than‑temporary declines in value have occurred include the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Impairment charges are recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
No
 impairments were recognized as a result of such review in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Deferred Compensation Plan Investments
Deferred compensation plan investments include investments in affiliated and third party mutual funds held in a rabbi trust under a deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan investments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in value in deferred compensation plan investments are recognized by the Company in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company's investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments are valued using quoted market prices available in an active market, which is the net asset value of the funds.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction (the “Swap”) to manage interest rate risk associated with a portion of its floating-rate long-term debt.

On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap effective as of that date.
The designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how the Company reflects the change in fair value of the derivative instrument. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if, at inception, it meets defined correlation and effectiveness criteria. These criteria require that the anticipated cash flows and/or changes in fair value of the hedging instrument substantially offset those of the position being hedged. The Swap was assessed for effectiveness and continued qualification for hedge accounting on a quarterly basis. Since inception through termination, the Swap was deemed to be highly effective.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, through the termination date, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Upon termination of the Swap, the mark-to-market gain of $
44.4
 million, before tax, was replaced in AOCI by a realized gain of an equal amount. Gains and losses from the Swap are reclassified from AOCI in the same period during the which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives, for further information.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally 
three
 to 
ten years
. Improvements to leased property are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the term of the applicable lease. When assets are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses resulting from the sale or disposal of assets as part of a restructuring plan are included in restructuring and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Equipment and leasehold improvements are tested for impairment whenever changes in facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

84

Table of Contents

Leases
The Company’s leases consist primarily of real estate leases for office space. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset are recognized on the commencement date for leases with terms longer than 
one year
. Lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease while ROU assets represent a right to use an underlying asset during the lease term. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term generally using the Company's incremental borrowing rate, which is determined through market sources. Lease components and non-lease components such as fixed maintenance and other costs are combined into one lease component and capitalized in lease liabilities. Variable lease payments, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease payments are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor. A ROU asset is measured initially as the value of the lease liability plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments and less lease incentives received. The lease term includes periods covered by options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Capitalized Service Contract Implementation Costs
The Company follows the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine for hosting arrangements that are service contracts which implementation costs to capitalize as assets. Costs incurred in the software application development stage such as customization, integration with Company software, coding and configuration are capitalized. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized service contract implementation costs are expensed over the fixed, noncancelable term of the contract plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The estimated term of the hosting arrangement is reassessed periodically, and any change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, with the remaining deferred costs recognized over the rest of the revised period. Amortization begins when the related component of the arrangement is ready for its intended use, and costs are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates in one business segment that provides investment management services and products to institutional, intermediary, retirement platforms and individual investors. Our determination that we had 
one
 operating segment is based on the fact that the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") reviews the Company's financial performance on an aggregate level. Refer to Note 21, Segment Reporting, for further information.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, the Company has determined that there is only one reporting unit.
The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the Company's use of the acquired assets in a business combination or strategy for the Company's overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant decreases in the Company’s market capitalization. The Company conducts the annual impairment assessment as of October 1
st 
and uses a qualitative approach to test for potential impairment of goodwill. If, after considering various factors, management determines that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, discount rates and terminal value. These assumptions and estimates can change in future periods based on market movement and factors impacting the expected business performance. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of our fair value.

85

Table of Contents

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Intangible assets acquired by the Company outside of a business combination are initially recognized and measured based on the Company's cost to acquire the intangible assets. If a group of assets is acquired, the cost is allocated to individual assets based on their relative fair value. In valuing these assets, we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates, and significant judgment is required.
Definite‑lived intangible assets represent the value of acquired customer relationships in or with institutional separate accounts, collective funds, intermediary wrap separate account (wrap SMA), unified managed account/model (UMA) intermediaries and private funds. Definite‑lived intangible assets also include intellectual property, advisory contracts that do not have a sufficient history of annual renewal, definite-lived trade name assets, lease-related assets and non‑competition agreements.
The Company amortizes definite‑lived identifiable intangible assets on a straight‑line basis over a period that is shorter than the asset's economic life as the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined. Management periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of the intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that a change in the useful life or impairment in value may have occurred. Indicators of impairment monitored by management include a decline in the level of managed assets, changes to contractual provisions underlying certain intangible assets and reductions in underlying operating cash flows. Should there be an indication of a change in the useful life or impairment in value of the definite‑lived intangible assets, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the underlying asset over its remaining useful life to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written down to its fair value determined using discounted cash flows. The Company writes off the cost and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized intangible assets.
Indefinite‑lived intangible assets include trade names and contracts for fund advisory, distribution and transfer agent services where the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to manage these funds indefinitely, the contracts have annual renewal provisions, and there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. Trade names are considered indefinite‑lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
Indefinite‑lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1
st
 using a qualitative approach which requires that positive and negative evidence collected as a result of considering various factors be weighed in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite‑lived intangible asset is impaired. In addition, periodically management reconsiders whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Indicators monitored by management that may indicate an indefinite useful life is no longer supported include a significant decline in the level of managed assets, changes to legal, regulatory or contractual provisions of the renewable investment advisory contracts and reductions in underlying operating cash flows.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they operate as a single asset and represent as a group the highest and best use of the assets. If the qualitative approach indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the indefinite‑lived intangible asset and compares it to the book value of the asset to determine whether an impairment charge is necessary. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
Investment Management Fees Receivable and Fund Administration and Distribution Fees Receivable
Investment management fees receivable include investment management fees due from the Victory Funds, the VictoryShares and other pooled funds sponsored by Victory and investment management fees due from non-affiliated parties. Fund administration and distribution fees receivable include administration, compliance and distribution fees due from the Victory Funds and the VictoryShares and transfer agent fees due from the Victory Portfolios III and sub-transfer agent fees due from the Victory Funds.

Provision for credit losses on these receivables is made in amounts required to maintain an adequate allowance to cover anticipated losses. All investment management fees receivable and fund administration and distribution fees receivable were determined to be collectible as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and accordingly, 
no
 reserve for credit losses and 
no
 provision for credit losses were recognized as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

86

Table of Contents

Other Receivables
Other receivables primarily include income and other taxes receivable and were determined to be collectible as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Advertising and Marketing Costs
In December 2022, the Company entered into a long-term partnership with Spurs Sports & Entertainment and executed naming rights and partnership agreements for the team’s new performance center. The agreements, which end in 2033, grant the Company exclusive naming rights, sponsorship, signage, advertising and other promotional rights and benefits for the new performance center.
Payments made under the agreements are deferred and expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. The related advertising and marketing expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of amounts paid less amortized expense are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets when cumulative payments exceed amortized expense and in other liabilities when amortized expense exceeds cumulative payments.
Share‑Based Compensation Arrangements
Compensation expense related to share‑based payments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of each option granted is estimated using the Black‑Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted share awards with service based vesting conditions and performance based vesting conditions is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share awards subject to market conditions is estimated based on a probability-weighted expected value analysis. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight‑line basis over the total vesting period of the award for the service portion of restricted share awards and stock option awards. Compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the derived service period for awards that vest based on market conditions and on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period for awards with performance conditions if it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures in the period the forfeiture occurs. The corresponding credit for restricted share and stock option compensation expense is recorded to additional paid in capital.
When changes are made to the terms of an equity award that result in a change in the fair value of the equity award immediately before and after the change, the Company applies modification accounting, treating the change as an exchange of the original award for a new award. The calculation of the incremental value associated with the modified award is based on the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award measured immediately before its terms are modified.
Earnings Per Share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, but adjusts for the dilutive effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company had vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock grants outstanding during the periods presented and applies the treasury stock method to these securities in its calculation of diluted earnings per share. The treasury stock method assumes that the proceeds of exercise are used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The Company does not have any participating securities that would require the use of the two‑class method of computing earnings per share.

Deferred Financing Fees
The costs of obtaining term loan financing are capitalized in long‑term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense and other financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the respective financing using the effective interest method. The costs of obtaining revolving line of credit financing are capitalized in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense and other financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight‑line basis over the term of the facility.
The 
Company expenses the portion of unamortized debt financing costs associated with paydowns of principal in excess of required loan amortization payments. Management considers this debt to be partially settled.

87

Table of Contents

Deferred 
financing costs expensed due to partial settlements of debt are recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Debt Modification
Gains and losses on debt modifications that are considered extinguishments are recognized in current earnings. Debt modifications that are not considered extinguishments are accounted for prospectively through yield adjustments, based on the revised terms. Legal fees and other costs incurred with third parties that are directly related to debt modifications are expensed as incurred and generally are included in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The analysis as to whether a modification of debt is an extinguishment or modification is performed on a creditor‑by‑creditor basis. Refer to Note 11, Debt, for further information on debt refinancings and modifications.
Treasury Stock
Acquisitions of treasury stock are recorded at cost. Treasury stock held is reported as a deduction from stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on a specific‑identification basis. Additional paid‑in capital from treasury stock transactions is increased as the Company reissues treasury stock for more than the cost of the shares. If the Company issues treasury stock for less than its cost, additional paid‑in capital from treasury stock transactions is reduced to no less than zero. Once this account is at zero, any further required reductions are recorded to retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Foreign Currency Transactions
The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries which operate outside of the U.S. are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), which were immaterial in amount as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the assets and liability method as required by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities are generally attributable to indefinite‑lived intangible assets, goodwill, depreciation, debt issuance costs and mark-to-market gains on the Swap. Deferred tax assets are generally attributable to definite‑lived intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, deferred compensation and acquisition-related costs. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more-likely-than-not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, recent operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods and the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused. Changes in circumstances could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the change.
The 
Company records income tax liabilities pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on de‑recognition, classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For tax positions meeting a more‑likely‑than‑not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being sustained. The more‑likely‑than‑not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the benefit. The

88

Table of Contents

Company's 
accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties is to classify these amounts as income taxes.
Loss Contingencies
The Company continuously reviews investor, client, employee or vendor complaints and pending or threatened litigation. The Company evaluates the likelihood that a loss contingency exists under the criteria of applicable accounting standards through consultation with legal counsel and records a loss contingency, inclusive of legal costs, if the contingency is probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The fair values are determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on valuations performed by the Company and independent valuation specialists.
Asset Acquisitions
When a group of assets is acquired that does constitute a business, the Company accounts for the transaction as an asset acquisition. The cost of the acquisition, which includes transaction costs directly related to the transaction and consideration paid, is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the net assets acquired.

Contingent and Deferred Payment Arrangements
The Company periodically enters into contingent and/or deferred payment arrangements in connection with its business combinations. Liabilities under contingent and deferred payment arrangements are recorded in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In contingent payment arrangements, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration to the sellers based on future performance, such as future net revenue levels. The Company estimates the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and records a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated fair value. In deferred payment arrangements, the Company records a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time a business combination is consummated for the present value, which is the estimated fair value, of the future fixed dollar contractual payments.
Contingent payment obligations are remeasured at fair value each reporting date taking into consideration changes in expected payments, and the change in fair value is recorded in the current period as a gain or loss. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent payment obligations are reflected in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company accretes obligations under deferred payment arrangements to their expected payment amounts over the period covered by the arrangement.
Compensatory Payment Arrangements
In connection with business combinations, the Company evaluates whether any portion of the transaction consideration is in exchange for elements other than the acquired business and should be accounted for as a separate transaction apart from the business combination. If based on the substance of the contingent payment arrangement, the Company determines that the payments are compensation for post-acquisition employee services, the Company considers this a compensatory payment arrangement and no liability is recorded for the payments on the acquisition date. The related expense, which is the total amount of compensation management estimates will be paid, is accrued on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period, which is the time period when management determines that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. At each reporting date, cumulative expense recognized under the compensatory payment arrangement will be at least equal to the cumulative dollar amount actually paid out and currently payable under the terms of the related purchase agreement. If there is a significant change in the estimated service period and/or estimated total compensation amount, management generally adjusts the amount of expense recorded on a prospective basis. Amounts recognized under compensatory payment arrangements is recorded in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the related liability is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue
The Company’s revenue includes fees earned from providing;
•
investment management services,
•
fund administration services,
•
fund transfer agent services, and
•
fund distribution services.

91

Table of Contents

Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company’s control including customer or underlying investor contributions and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable.
The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service.
Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.
AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds and certain other pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed.
Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change.
The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct services are received in exchange for these payments.
Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of investment performance on a client’s account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the

92

Table of Contents

customer. Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer’s contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement with certain equity and fixed income Victory Funds III is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month.

Fund Administration Fees
The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets and constraints are removed. The Company’s fund administration fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis.
Fund Compliance Fees
The Company has an agreement to provide compliance design, administration and oversight services for the Victory Funds and the VictoryShares in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act. The Company furnishes a VCM employee to serve as the Chief Compliance Officer and provides other compliance personnel and resources reasonably necessary to perform the services under this agreement. The Company earns a fixed annual fee for these compliance services which is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fund Transfer Agent Fees
The Company recognizes fund transfer agent fees using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund transfer agent fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to either the average daily net assets of the Victory Funds III for which transfer agent services are provided or number of accounts in the Victory Funds III. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets or actual number of accounts and constraints are removed. The Company’s fund transfer agent fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company also receives fees for sub-transfer agency services under contracts with the Victory Funds for member class shares. Sub-transfer agency fees are recognized and recorded in a manner similar to fund transfer agent fees and are recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. As the Company is the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the Victory Funds III and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis.
Fund Distribution Fees
The Company receives compensation for sales and sales-related services promised under distribution contracts with the Victory Funds. Revenue is measured in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing distribution services. Distribution fees are generally calculated as a percentage of average net assets in the Victory Funds. The Company’s performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the services is transferred to customers, which is upon investor subscription or redemption.

93

Table of Contents

Based on the nature of the calculation, the revenue for these services is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company may recognize distribution fee revenue in the current period that pertains to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods as variable consideration is recognized only when uncertainties are resolved. The Company’s distribution fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. The Company is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties.
Included in fund distribution fees are transaction and account-level fees paid by VCS brokerage platform customers for trade execution, cash transfer and other services.
Costs Incurred to Obtain or Fulfill Customer Contracts
The Company is required to capitalize certain costs directly related to the acquisition or fulfillment of a contact with a customer. Victory has not identified any sales-based compensation or similar costs that meet the definition of an incremental cost to acquire a contract and as such we have no intangible assets related to contract acquisitions.
Direct costs incurred to fulfill services under the Company’s distribution contracts include sales commissions paid to third party dealers for the sale of Class C Shares. The Company may pay upfront sales commissions to dealers and institutions that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commission payments with respect to Class C shares equal 
1.00
% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit.
Valuation of AUM and fund investments
The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company’s other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.

The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds’ net asset values or the total fair value of the funds’ portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees.

For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company’s total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation.

NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS
USAA AMCO Acquisition
Under the terms of the USAA AMCO Acquisition purchase agreement, a maximum of $
150.0
 million ($
37.5
 million per year) in contingent payments was payable to sellers based on the annual revenue of USAA Asset Management Company attributable to all “non-managed money”-related AUM in each of the first 
four years
 following the closing. To receive any contingent payment in respect of “non-managed money”-related assets for a given year, annual revenue from “non-managed money”-related assets was required to be at least 
80
% 
of the revenue run-rate (as calculated under the Stock Purchase Agreement) of the USAA Asset Management Company's “non-managed money”-related assets under management as of the closing date, and to achieve

94

Table of Contents

the 
maximum contingent payment for a given year, such annual revenue was required to be at least 
100
% of that closing date revenue run-rate. In 2023, the Company paid $
36.4
 million in cash to sellers for the fourth and final earn out period payment, bringing total cumulative contingent payments to $
148.9
 million.
The Company recorded an increase in the liability of $
8.7
 million in 2023 and a decrease in the liability of $
3.6
 million in 2022 in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NEC Acquisition

On November 1, 2021, VCM completed the acquisition of 
100
% of the equity interests in NEC. Founded in 2004 and based in Hanover, New Hampshire, NEC is an alternative asset management firm focused on debt and equity investments in clean energy infrastructure projects and companies through private closed-end funds (the “NEC Funds”).

The NEC Acquisition purchase price was $
63.1
 million, which included $
62.8
 million in cash paid at closing, net of cash acquired, and $
0.3
 million of net working capital adjustments paid to sellers in 2022. Under the terms of the NEC purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional $
35.0
 million in cash based on NEC’s net revenue growth over a 
six-year
 period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the 
36
-month, 
48
-month and 
60
-month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the “Start Date”) for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12-month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments, less any contingent payments previously paid, is due upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date.
The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for post-closing services. Accordingly, these contingent payments were excluded from the purchase price for the NEC Acquisition and a liability for these contingent payments was not recorded on the acquisition date. The Company records compensation expense over the estimated service period in an amount equal to the total contingent payments currently forecasted to be paid.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined that the contingent payments are no longer probable of occurring and the liability for NEC contingent payments is zero. The liability for NEC contingent payments totaled $
13.7
 million as of December 31, 2023 which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to the NEC contingent payment compensation expense was a decrease of $
13.7
 million in personnel compensation and benefits. The Company recorded $
5.6
 million and $
5.5
 million in NEC contingent payment compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is included in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

WestEnd Acquisition

On and effective December 31, 2021, the Company completed the WestEnd Acquisition. Founded in 2004, and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, WestEnd is an ETF strategist advisor that provides financial advisors with a turnkey, core model allocation strategy for either a holistic solution or complementary source of alpha.

The aggregate purchase price for the WestEnd Acquisition was $
716.1
 million, net of cash acquired, which includes (i) $
475.8
 million in cash paid at closing (the “WestEnd Closing”) net of cash acquired, (ii) the acquisition date value of contingent payments due to sellers of $
239.7
 million and iii) $
0.6
 million paid in cash to sellers in 2022 for net working capital adjustments. The contingent earn-out payments are based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during each of the first 
four years
 following the WestEnd Closing, subject to certain “catch-up” provisions over a 
five and one half year
 period following the WestEnd Closing. A maximum of $
320.0
 million ($
80.0
 million per year) in earn-out payments may be paid.

The estimated fair value for contingent consideration payable to sellers is estimated using the real options method. WestEnd net revenue growth is simulated in a risk-neutral framework to calculate expected probability-weighted earn out payments, which are then discounted from the expected payment dates at the relevant cost of debt. Significant assumptions and inputs include the WestEnd net revenue projected annual growth rate, the

95

Table of Contents

market price of risk, which adjusts the projected revenue growth rate to a risk-neutral expected growth rate, revenue volatility and discount rate. The market price of risk and revenue volatility are based on data for comparable companies. As the contingent consideration represents a subordinate, unsecured claim of the Company, the Company assesses a discount rate which incorporates adjustments for credit risk and the subordination of the contingent consideration.

The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was $
139.9
 million and $
217.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the Company paid $
80.0
 million in cash to sellers as a catch-up payment for the first earn-out period.

Significant inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration payable to sellers as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the acquisition date are as follows and are approximate values:

0.01
, representing 
4.9
% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, after giving effect to that issuance, and the balance in newly issued shares of a new class of Preferred Stock.

The Base Share Consideration is subject to customary adjustments for Amundi US’s indebtedness, cash, working capital and unpaid transaction expenses. The Base Share Consideration is also subject to adjustment if Amundi does not obtain client consents relating to the assignment of investment advisory contracts or the approval of new investment advisory contracts (as applicable) (“Client Consents”) representing revenues equal to at least 
93.5
% of the Aggregate Base Date Revenue Run-Rate (as defined in the Contribution Agreement). The Base Share Consideration is also subject to a customary post-Closing adjustment as well as a true-up payment in respect of Client Consents obtained in the 180 days following the Closing.

At the Closing, the Company and Amundi will enter into a shareholder agreement (the “Shareholder Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Amundi will be (i) granted certain resale shelf and piggyback registration rights in respect of the Common Stock and any shares of the Common Stock issuable by the Company upon the conversion of Preferred Stock, in each case, to the extent the Company Preferred Stock and the Common Stock was issued to Amundi under the Contribution Agreement (such shares of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock, the “Acquired Shares”) or acquired pursuant to 
Amundi’s 
participation rights under the Shareholder Agreement and (ii) entitled to nominate two members of the Board for so long as 

96

it 
holds at least 50% of the Acquired Shares (without giving effect to certain sales by Amundi) and one member of the Board for so long as it holds at least 33% of the Acquired Shares (without giving effect to certain sales by Amundi). In addition, for a period of three years following the Closing,
 Amundi will be subject to a customary “lock-up” of the Acquired Shares (subject to certain exceptions) and a standstill, which among other things, prohibits Amundi from acquiring additional equity securities of the Company (subject to certain exceptions).
The Amundi Parties, the Company, and VCM have also entered into an Off-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement and an On-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement which will become effective on the date of the Closing (except with respect to certain specified provisions set forth therein, which became effective as of the entry into such agreements).

The Closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of first quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and regulatory authorizations.

NOTE 5. 
Fair Value Measurements
The Company determines the fair value of certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value determinations utilize a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability.

97

Table of Contents

Classification within the fair value hierarchy contains three levels:
•
Level 1—Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2—Valuation inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured.
•
Level 3—Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Level 1 assets consist of money market funds and open-end mutual funds. The fair values for these assets are determined utilizing quoted market prices for identical assets.

Contingent consideration arrangements represent the WestEnd earn-out payment liability which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Significant unobservable inputs for the option pricing model used to determine the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition earn-out payment liability include the WestEnd net revenue projected growth rate, revenue volatility, market price of risk and discount rate. An increase in the projected growth rate for revenue results in a higher fair value for the earn-out payment liability while an increase in the discount rate results in a lower fair value for the earnout payment liability. An increase in the market price of risk and revenue volatility results in a lower fair value. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, for further details related to the valuation of contingent consideration payable related to the WestEnd Acquisition.

Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangement liabilities, realized or unrealized, are recorded in earnings and are included in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

There were

 transfers between any of the Level 1, 2 and 3 categories in the fair value measurement hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognizes transfers at the end of the reporting period.
The net carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short‑term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 is considered to be its carrying value as the interest rate on the bank debt is variable and approximates current market rates. As a result, Level 2 inputs are utilized to determine the fair value of our long‑term debt.

NOTE 6. Related‑Party Transactions
The Company considers certain funds that it manages, including the Victory Funds, the VictoryShares, collective trust funds that it sponsors (the “Victory Collective Funds”), the NEC Funds and other pooled investment vehicles that it sponsors, to be related parties as a result of its advisory relationship.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax reporting purposes.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as projections of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. Based on the consideration of these facts, the Company believes it is more likely than not that all of its gross deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, and as a result, has 
no
t recorded a valuation allowance on these amounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

We have analyzed the Company’s tax positions for all open years and have concluded that no additional provision for income tax is required in the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next twelve months.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released a framework (“Pillar 2”) in 2021 to introduce a global minimum tax of 
15
% for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds. Certain aspects of Pillar 2 were effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. Each country is required to implement Pillar 2 through its own local tax legislation. Although the U.S. has not yet enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2, many other countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, legislation to implement Pillar 2. Pillar 2 did not materially impact the Company’s effective tax rate or its Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2024. The Company does not currently expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on its future effective tax rates or consolidated financial statements and continues to monitor Pillar 2 developments.

NOTE 11. Debt
2019 Credit Agreement
On July 1, 2019, concurrent with the USAA AMCO Acquisition, the Company entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement, repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement (the “2018 Credit Agreement”), and terminated the 2018 Credit Agreement.

The 2019 Credit Agreement was entered into among Victory, as borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company obtained a 
seven-year
 term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $
1.1
 billion (the “2019 Term Loans”) and established a 
five-year
 revolving credit facility (which was unfunded as of the closing date) with aggregate commitments of $
100.0
 million (with a $
10.0
 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit).

The obligations of the Company under the 2019 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company’s domestic subsidiaries (other than VCS) (the “Guarantors”) and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to certain customary exceptions.
The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that affect, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge or dissolve, make investments, dispose of assets, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make distributions and dividends and prepayments of junior indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, amend documentation governing junior indebtedness, modify its fiscal year and modify its organizational documents, subject to customary exceptions, thresholds, qualifications and “baskets.” In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement contains a financial performance covenant, requiring a maximum first lien leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 
35.0
% of the commitments thereunder (excluding certain letters of credit), of no greater than 
3.80
 to 1.00.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with its financial performance covenant.
First Amendment
Amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement originally accrued interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) plus a margin of 
3.25
% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 
2.25
%.
On January 17, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank.
Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company refinanced the 2019 Term Loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
952.0
 million (the “2020 Term Loans”). The 2020 Term Loans provided for substantially the same terms as the 2019 Term Loans, including the same maturity date of 
July 1, 2026
,

Table of Contents

except 
that the 
2020 Term Loans reduced the applicable margin on LIBOR by 
75
 basis points
, resulting in an applicable margin on LIBOR under the 2020 Term Loans of 
2.50
%.

Second Amendment
On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the 2020 Term Loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
755.7
 million (the “Repriced Term Loans”). The Repriced Term Loans provided for substantially the same terms as the 2020 Term Loans, including the same maturity date of 
July 2026
, except that the 
Repriced Term Loans reduced the applicable margin on LIBOR by 
25
 basis points
, resulting in an applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans of 
2.25
%.

Third Amendment

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the “2021 Incremental Term Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount of $
505.0
 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.

The 2021 Incremental Term Loans will mature in 
December 2028
 and, until the Fourth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, accrued interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 
50
 basis point floor) plus a margin of 
2.25
% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 
1.25
%.
Original issue discount was $
2.5
 million for the 2021 Incremental Term Loans. The Company incurred a total of $
9.1
 million of other third party costs related to the 2021 Incremental Term Loans, which were recorded as term loan debt issuance costs.
Fourth Amendment
On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on its debt from LIBOR to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate from the Fourth Amendment.
The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment’s effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company’s term loans. The Company has continued to elect the three-month Term SOFR rate for all of the term loans outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement since executing the Fourth Amendment.
Fifth Amendment
On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $
100.0
 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 
0.50
% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred $
1.0
 million in upfront fees, arranger fees and other third party costs related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, which were recorded to revolving credit facility debt issuance cost in other assets.
On July 1, 2024, the Company executed an agency succession agreement, by and among Barclays Bank PLC as the resigning administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2019 Credit Agreement and Royal Bank of Canada, as the successor administrative agent and collateral agent.

NOTE 12. Derivatives
Interest Rate Swap
In 2020, the Company entered into the Swap to manage interest rate risk associated with a portion of its floating-rate long-term debt. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Under the terms of the original Swap agreement, the Company paid interest at a fixed rate of interest on a quarterly basis and received interest at the three-month LIBOR rate in effect for that quarter.

107

Table of Contents

In 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $
450
 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $
450
 million of the Company’s outstanding term loan debt through 
July 1, 2026
 changed from 
3.215
% to 
3.149
% as a result of the amendment to the Swap.

The Company elected to apply certain optional expedients available under ASC 848 providing relief from contract modification and hedge accounting requirements to the amendments to the Swap agreement. As a result, the Company was not required to evaluate whether the modifications to the Swap agreement resulted in the establishment of a new contract or the continuation of an existing contract and elected not to remeasure the contract at the modification date or reassess its previous accounting determination. The modified contract is accounted for, and presented as, a continuation of the existing contract. The Company also elected to change the contractual terms of the Swap without dedesignating the existing hedging relationship and redesignating a new hedging relationship.

The designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how the Company reflects the change in fair value of the derivative instrument. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if, at inception, it meets defined correlation and effectiveness criteria. These criteria require that the anticipated cash flows and/or changes in fair value of the hedging instrument substantially offset those of the position being hedged. The Swap was assessed for effectiveness and continued qualification for hedge accounting on a quarterly basis. Since inception, the Swap was deemed to be highly effective.
The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI, net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses from the Swap are reclassified to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. Cash flows from the Swap are classified as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the classification of cash flows from the hedged transactions.

In 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap ("Swap Termination Agreement"). The Swap Termination Agreement was effective on October 30, 2023. Under the Swap Termination Agreement, the Swap counterparty agreed to pay the Company $
43.4
 million in cash, which was comprised of the $
45.8
 million value of the Swap on the termination date inclusive of $
1.4
 million of interest receivable less $
2.4
 million in swap unwind costs.

As a result of the Swap Termination Agreement, the Company recorded a $
44.4
 million deferred gain in AOCI, before tax, replacing the $
44.4
 million fair value of the Swap in AOCI, before tax. The deferred gain on the Swap monetization is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the Consolidated Stateme
nts of Operations. The Swap unwind costs of $
2.4
 million were recorded in general and administrative costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Due to the termination of the Swap, there was 
no
 amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

NOTE 13. Equity Method Investment
In September 2020, the Company acquired, through a wholly owned subsidiary, a 
15
% interest voting share and income share in Alderwood and made a capital contribution to Alderwood of $
1.5
 million in cash. The Company also committed to contribute additional capital of $
4.5
 million to Alderwood and $
50.0
 million to a private fund to be launched by Alderwood, subject to certain terms and conditions. Alderwood’s operating entity, Alderwood Capital, was a London-based investment advisory firm focused on taking minority stakes in specialist boutique asset management businesses.

In January 2022, the Company signed an amendment to the Alderwood members’ agreement (“Alderwood Amendment”) and made an additional $
1.5
 million capital contribution to Alderwood. The Alderwood Amendment reduced the Company’s commitment to contribute additional capital to Alderwood from $
4.5
 million to $
3.0
 million.

In July 2022, Alderwood decided to wind down its business and operations, including the business and operations of its private fund. On July 31, 2022, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary retired as a member of Alderwood thereby terminating the Company’s commitment to contribute an additional $
3.0
 million in capital to Alderwood and $
50.0
 million in capital to Alderwood’s private fund. Alderwood returned the $
1.5
 million in capital contributed to Alderwood pursuant to the Alderwood Amendment, and the Company recognized a loss on disposal of its investment in Alderwood of $
0.8
 million.
Given the level of ownership interest in Alderwood, an English limited liability partnership, and the fact that Alderwood maintained specific ownership accounts for investors, the Company accounted for its investment in Alderwood using the equity method of accounting.

Losses from equity method investments are recorded in interest income and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, losses from equity method investments totaled $
0.8
 million ($
0
 in 2023 and 2024). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 equity method investments.

NOTE 14. Equity
Equity Structure

Under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation filed by the Company on November 23, 2021, authorized capital stock consists of

10,000,000
 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, $
0.01
 par value per share. The Company currently has one class of Common Stock entitling the holder to

NOTE 15. Share‑Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
Prior to the Company’s IPO in 2018, equity-based awards were issued to executives, directors and key employees of the Company under the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) and the Outside Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “Director Plan”).
In connection with the IPO, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), and the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP Plan”), each of which became effective upon the completion of the IPO. 
No
 further grants will be made under the 2013 Plan.
The 2018 Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other awards that may be settled in or based upon shares of the Company’s Common Stock.

On May 8, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2018 Plan which increased the number of shares of Common Stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, authorized for issuance under the 2018 Plan by

In addition, shares withheld or surrendered in connection with the payment of an exercise price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.

Table of Contents

The Company uses the Common Stock closing price on the grant date as the grant date fair value of restricted share awards. For stock option awards, the grant date fair value of stock option awards is computed using Black‑Scholes option pricing framework.

Share-based Compensation Expense
The Company recorded $
15.2
 million, $
16.5
 million and $
17.8
 million of share-based compensation expense related to the 2018 Plan and 2013 Plan in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recorded in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related tax benefits were $
3.7
 million for 2024 and $
4.0
 million and $
4.3
 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company expects to recognize total share-based compensation expense of $

In general, our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
1
 year to 
12
 years. These leases gen
erally contain renewal options for periods ranging from 
two
 to 
five years
. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable lease costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease costs are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor.
Future undiscounted cash flows related to our operating leases and the reconciliation to operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 are shown in the table below.

NOTE 17. Employee Benefit Plans
The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), covering substantially all employees who have met the eligibility requirements. The 401(k) Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. In 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company recognized expense o
f $
5.4
 million, $
5.0
 million and $
4.8
 million in employer matched contributions, respectively.
The Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan primarily for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees (“Employee DC Plan”) as a means to reward and motivate them. The Company purchases mutual funds as directed by the plan participants to fund its related obligations. Such securities are held in a rabbi trust for the participants, and under the terms of the trust agreement, the assets of the trust are available to satisfy the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
The Company created a deferred compensation plan for non-employee members of our board of directors (the “Director DC Plan”). Benefits payable under the Director DC Plan are payable from the Company’s general assets. Amounts contributed under the Director DC Plan and earnings on those amounts are subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors.

Gains and losses from fluctuations in value of deferred compensation plan investments are included in interest income and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are offset entirely by the corresponding changes in value of the deferred compensation liability. Changes in the value of the Employee DC Plan and Director DC Plan liabilities are recorded in personnel compensation and benefits and general and administrative expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments held under both deferred compensation plans are recorded in deferred compensation plan investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the components of deferred compensation plan-related expense related to the Employee DC Plan.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the number of outstanding instruments excluded from the above computations of weighted average shares for diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti‑dilutive was de minimis. Holders of non‑vested share‑based compensation awards do not have rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the shares covered by the awards.

NOTE 19. Net Capital Requirements
VCS is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3‑1 under the Exchange Act) administered by the SEC and FINRA, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, cannot exceed 15 to 1. Net capital and the related net capital requirement may fluctuate on a daily basis.
At December 31, 2024, VCS had net capital under the Rule 15c3‑1 of $
1.2
 million, which was $
1.1
 million in excess of its minimum required net capital of $
0.1
 milli
on. At December 31, 2023, VCS had net capital under the Rule 15c3‑1 of $
0.4
 million, which was $
0.3
 million in excess of its minimum required net capital of $
0.1
 million. The Company's ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 
1.66
 to 1 and 
5.15
 to 1, respectively.
Capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from VCS to the parent company. VCS's cash and cash equivalents are generally not available for corporate purposes.

NOTE 21. SEGMENT REPORTING
ASU 2023-07, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report segment revenue and significant expenses reported in Net income, the primary measurement used in evaluating segment performance. Since the Company operates and reports in one segment, all financial segment information required by ASU 2023-07 can be found in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company provides investment management services and products to institutional, intermediary, retirement platforms and individual investors. The presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way discrete financial information is available that is regularly provided to our Chief Executive Officer, the CODM. When making decisions about allocating resources, assessing performance, and understanding how our long-term organic revenue growth is driven by investment decisions our CODM considers the impact on consolidated, entity-wide performance and financial results.

Supplemental information related to significant segment expenses included the Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the

financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

This consideration payable for acquisition of business resulted from the acquisition of WestEnd on December 31, 2021, and is based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during a 4 year period subsequent to December 31, 2021 and subject to certain catch up provisions over a five and one half year period following December 31, 2021. As more fully described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the fair value of the future expected contingent payments using the real options method, and the significant assumptions are the net revenue 5 year average annual growth rate, market price of risk adjustment for revenue (continuous), revenue volatility and discount rates for the WestEnd investment franchise.
Auditing the fair value of the consideration payable for acquisition of business was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value, and the complexity of the valuation model used. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity and highly subjective nature of the significant assumptions described above, which are affected by future economic and market conditions and thus require significant judgement, and the inherent complexity of the valuation model.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s development of the significant assumptions and process to estimate the fair value of the consideration payable for acquisition of business. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and methods used to develop the fair value estimate, the accuracy of the calculations included within the valuation model, and the underlying data used in the valuation model.

To test the valuation of the consideration payable for acquisition of business, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the net future revenue projections and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s assumptions by comparing them to current industry, market and economic trends, and historical results of the Company's business and other guideline companies within the same industry. We also tested the clerical accuracy of the net revenue projection calculations.

To evaluate the valuation methodology used by management’s specialist, we involved our valuation specialists to assist in developing an independent range of the fair value of the consideration payable for acquisition of business. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the consideration payable for acquisition of business resulting from changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income(loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A. Control
s and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.

Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures by our management as of December 31, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15(f) and Rule 15d‑15(f) of the Exchange Act. In connection with their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
