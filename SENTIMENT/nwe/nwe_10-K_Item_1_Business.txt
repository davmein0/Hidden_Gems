Item 1. Business
, where we discuss electric resource planning for our Montana and South Dakota jurisdictions. 
Distribution and Transmission Modernization and Maintenance - 
The primary goals of our infrastructure investments are to reverse the trend in aging infrastructure, maintain reliability, proactively manage safety, build capacity into the system, and prepare our network for the adoption of new technologies. We are taking a proactive and pragmatic approach to replacing these assets while also evaluating the implementation of additional technologies to prepare the overall system for smart grid applications. Over $2.2 billion or 82 percent of our capital forecast above is projected to be spent on our distribution and transmission system. Beginning in 2021, we began installing automated metering infrastructure in Montana. We expect this project to be substantially complete in 2025, with a total cost of approximately $105.0 million, of which approximately $10.0 million remains and is reflected in the five year capital forecast above.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our consolidated results include the results of our divisions and subsidiaries constituting each of our business segments. The overall consolidated discussion is followed by a detailed discussion of utility margin by segment.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations
Our revenues may fluctuate substantially with changes in supply costs, which are generally collected in rates from customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas utility service within their respective jurisdictions and regulate our ability to recover costs from customers.
Revenues are also impacted by customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily affected by weather and the impact of energy efficiency initiatives and investment. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among our residential customers. We measure this effect using degree-days, which is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of 65 degrees. Heating degree-days result when the average daily temperature is less than the baseline. Cooling degree-days result when the average daily temperature is greater than the baseline. The statistical weather information in our regulated segments represents a comparison of this data.
Fuel, purchased supply and direct transmission expenses are costs directly associated with the generation and procurement of electricity and natural gas. These costs are generally collected in rates from customers and may fluctuate substantially with market prices and customer usage. 
Operating and maintenance expenses are costs associated with the ongoing operation of our vertically-integrated utility facilities which provide electric and natural gas utility products and services to our customers. Among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision, repair and maintenance expenses, and contract services. These costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges and therefore do not normally increase or decrease significantly in the short term with increases or decreases in volumes.

OVERALL CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2023 
Consolidated net income in 2024 was $224.1 million as compared with $194.1 million in 2023, an increase of $30.0 million. This increase was primarily due to new base rates in Montana and South Dakota, electric transmission revenue, and income tax benefits related to the gas repairs safe harbor method and a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits. These were offset in part by non-recoverable Montana electric supply costs, a less favorable QF liability adjustment, electric and natural gas retail volumes, depreciation, operating, administrative and general costs, and interest expense.
Consolidated gross margin in 2024 was $460.8 million as compared with $416.3 million in 2023, an increase of $44.5 million or 10.7 percent. This increase was primarily due to new base rates in Montana and South Dakota, electric transmission revenue, Montana interim rates, subject to refund, and Montana property tax tracker collections. These were offset in party by non-recoverable Montana electric supply costs, a less favorable QF liability adjustment, electric and natural gas retail volumes, and depreciation.

Lower electric residential and commercial retail volumes were driven by unfavorable weather in South Dakota impacting residential demand and lower commercial demand in all jurisdictions as compared to the prior year, partly offset by higher industrial demand and customer growth. Lower natural gas retail volumes were driven by unfavorable weather in all jurisdictions partly offset by customer growth.
Under the PCCAM, net supply costs higher or lower than the PCCAM base rate (PCCAM Base) (excluding qualifying facility (QF) costs) are allocated 90 percent to Montana customers and 10 percent to shareholders. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we under-collected supply costs of $8.0 million resulting in an increase to our under collection of costs, and recorded a decrease in pre-tax earnings of $0.9 million (10 percent of the PCCAM Base cost variance). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we over collected supply costs of $32.9 million resulting in a reduction to our under collection of costs, and recorded an increase in pre-tax earnings of $7.0 million, which was inclusive of a $3.2 million increase in pre-tax earnings related to the retroactive application of higher PCCAM Base rates to July 1, 2022.
The less favorable adjustment to our electric QF liability (unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) as part of a 2002 stipulation with the MPSC and other parties) reflects a $0.8 million gain in 2024, as compared with a $5.0 million gain for the same period in 2023, due to a favorable adjustment in the prior year, decreasing the QF liability by $4.2 million, reflecting annual actual contract price escalation for the 2023-2024 contract year, which was less than previously estimated. The 2023-2024 contract year was the last year of the contract that contains variable pricing terms.

(1) In order to present the total change in labor and benefits, we have included the change in the non-service cost component of our pension and other postretirement benefits, which is recorded within other income on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. This change is offset within this table as it does not affect our operating expenses.
Consolidated operating income in 2024 was $323.3 million as compared with $300.5 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to new base rates in Montana and South Dakota, electric transmission revenue, Montana interim rates, subject to refund, and Montana property tax tracker collections. These were offset in part by non-recoverable Montana electric supply costs, a less favorable QF liability adjustment, electric and natural gas retail volumes, depreciation, operating, and administrative and general costs.
Consol
idated interest expense in 2024 was $131.7 million, as compared with $114.6 million in 2023. This increase was due to higher borrowings and interest rates, partly offset by higher capitalization of AFUDC.
49
Consolidated other income in 2024 was $23.0 million, as compared with $15.8 million in 2023. 
This increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million reversal of a previously expensed Community Renewable Energy Project penalty due to a favorable legal ruling, higher capitalization of AFUDC, a decrease in the non-service cost component of pension expense, and an increase in the value of deferred shares held in trust for deferred compensation, offset in part by a $2.5 million non-cash impairment of an alternative energy storage equity investment.
Consolidated income tax benefit in 2024 was $9.4 million, as compared to an income tax expense of $7.5 million in 2023. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was (4.4) percent as compared with 3.7 percent for the same period of 2023. As further discussed in 
Note 12 - Income Taxes
, income tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, includes a $21.0 million benefit related to a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of $4.1 million of previously accrued interest ($16.9 million net of interest). Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we filed a tax accounting method change with the IRS consistent with the guidance for natural gas transmission and distribution property. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $7.0 million during 2024, related to repair costs that were previously capitalized for tax purposes in the 2022 and prior tax years. Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, includes a one-time $3.2 million expense for the reduction of previously claimed alternative minimum tax credits as well as a $3.2 million benefit related to a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits. 
We currently estimate our effective tax rate will range between 13.0 percent to 17.0 percent in 2025. Based on the significant NOL income tax position we have, we anticipate paying minimal cash for income taxes into 2028.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS
We have various classifications of electric revenues, defined as follows:
•
Retail: Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers, and the impact of regulatory mechanisms. 
•
Regulatory amortization: Primarily represents timing differences for electric supply costs and property taxes between when we incur these costs and when we recover these costs in rates from our customers, which is also reflected in fuel, purchased supply and direct transmission expense and therefore has minimal impact on utility margin. The amortization of these amounts are offset in retail revenue.
•
Transmission: Reflects transmission revenues regulated by the FERC.
•
Wholesale and other are largely utility margin neutral as they are offset by changes in fuel, purchased supply and direct transmission expense.

Lower electric residential and commercial retail volumes were driven by unfavorable weather in South Dakota impacting residential demand and lower commercial demand in all jurisdictions as compared to the prior year, partly offset by higher industrial demand and customer growth.
Under the PCCAM, net supply costs higher or lower than the PCCAM base rate (PCCAM Base) (excluding qualifying facility (QF) costs) are allocated 90 percent to Montana customers and 10 percent to shareholders. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we under-collected supply costs of $8.0 million resulting in an increase to our under collection of costs, and recorded a decrease in pre-tax earnings of $0.9 million (10 percent of the PCCAM Base cost variance). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we over collected supply costs of $32.9 million resulting in a reduction to our under collection of costs, and recorded an increase in pre-tax earnings of $7.0 million, which was inclusive of a $3.2 million increase in pre-tax earnings related to the retroactive application of higher PCCAM Base rates to July 1, 2022.
The less favorable adjustment to our electric QF liability (unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) as part of a 2002 stipulation with the MPSC and other parties) reflects a $0.8 million gain in 2024, as compared with a $5.0 million gain for the same period in 2023, as further explained above in the consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.
The change in regulatory amortization revenue is due to timing differences between when we incur electric supply costs and when we recover these costs in rates from our customers, which has a minimal impact on utility margin.

Our wholesale and other revenues are largely utility margin neutral as they are offset by changes in fuel, purchased supply and direct transmission expenses.

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
We have various classifications of natural gas revenues, defined as follows:
•
Retail: Sales of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers, and the impact of regulatory mechanisms. 
•
Regulatory amortization: Primarily represents timing differences for natural gas supply costs and property taxes between when we incur these costs and when we recover these costs in rates from our customers, which is also reflected in fuel, purchased supply and direct transmission expenses and therefore has minimal impact on utility margin. The amortization of these amounts are offset in retail revenue.
•
Wholesale: Primarily represents transportation and storage for others.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We require liquidity to support and grow our business, and use our liquidity for working capital needs, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets, and to repay debt. For NorthWestern Energy Group, liquidity is primarily provided through its revolving credit facility and dividends from its utility operating subsidiaries, NW Corp and NWE Public Service. These subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions that may limit the amount of their dividend distributions. See 
Note 16 - Common Stock
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these dividend restrictions.
We believe our cash flows from operations, existing borrowing capacity, debt and equity issuances and future utility rate increases should be sufficient to fund our operations, service existing debt, pay dividends, and fund capital expenditures. We plan to maintain a 50 - 55 percent debt to total capital ratio excluding finance leases, and expect to continue targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60 - 70 percent of earnings per share; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these targets.
As of December 31, 2024, our total consolidated net liquidity was approximately $191.3 million, including $4.3 million of cash and $187.0 million of revolving credit facility availability with no letters of credit outstanding.

As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $29.0 million as compared with $25.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $406.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with $489.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As shown in the table below, this decrease in operating cash flows is primarily due to minimal net cash inflows for energy supply costs in the current period due to the timely recovery of energy supply costs compared to significant net cash inflows in 2023 from the recovery of previously under-collected energy supply costs.

Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities totaled $554.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with $570.8 million during 2023. Plant additions during 2024 include capital maintenance additions of approximately $324.0 million and capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $225.3 million. Plant additions during 2023 included capital maintenance additions of approximately $321.9 million and capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $245.0 million. As discussed above in the “Significant Infrastructure Investments and Initiatives” section, our capital expenditures are forecasted to be $531.0 million in 2024. Additionally, as discussed above in the "Significant Trends and Regulation" section, we anticipate investing $39.0 million for the acquisition of the Energy West Montana Assets in 2025.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities totaled $151.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with $84.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by financing activities reflects proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $215.0 million, short-term borrowings of $100.0 million, and net issuances under our revolving lines of credit of $95.0 million, partly offset by payment of dividends of $158.6 million and repayment of 1.00 percent, $100.0 million of Montana First Mortgage Bonds. During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities reflects net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $300.0 million and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of $73.6 million, partly offset by payment of dividends of $154.1 million and net repayments under our revolving lines of credit of $132.0 million.
Cash Requirements and Capital Resources
We believe our cash flows from operations, existing borrowing capacity, debt and equity issuances and future rate increases should be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the short-term and the long-term. As a rate-regulated utility our customer rates are generally structured to recover expected operating costs, with an opportunity to earn a return on our invested capital. This structure supports recovery for many of our operating expenses, although there are situations where the timing of our cash outlays results in increased working capital requirements. Due to the seasonality of our utility business, our short-term working capital requirements typically peak during the coldest winter months and warmest summer months when we cover the lag between when purchasing energy supplies and when customers pay for these costs. Our credit facilities may also be utilized for funding cash requirements during seasonally active construction periods, with peak activity during warmer months. Our cash requirements also include a variety of contractual obligations as outlined below in the “Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments” section.
Our material cash requirements are also related to investment in our business through our capital expenditure program, which is discussed above in the “Significant Infrastructure Investments and Initiatives” section. Our capital expenditures are forecasted to be $531 million in 2025, $549 million in 2026, and $557 million in 2027. We anticipate funding capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, available credit sources, debt issuances and future rate increases. The actual amount of capital expenditures is subject to certain factors including the impact that a material change in operations, available financing, supply chain issues, or inflation could impact our current liquidity and ability to fund capital resource requirements. Events such as these could cause us to defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures, as necessary. To fund our strategic 
56
growth opportunities, we evaluate the additional capital need in balance with debt capacity and equity issuances that would be intended to allow us to maintain investment grade ratings.
Short-term Borrowings
For further information on our short-term borrowings, see 
Note 10 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Arrangements
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. NorthWestern Energy Group has $100.0 million of short-term borrowings maturing in 2025, which we intend to refinance. 
Credit Facilities 
Liquidity is generally provided by internal operating cash flows and the use of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. We utilize availability under our revolving credit facilities to manage our cash flows due to the seasonality of our business and to fund capital investment. Cash on hand in excess of current operating requirements is generally used to invest in our business and reduce borrowings.
For further information on our credit facilities, see 
Note 10 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Arrangements
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Long-term Debt and Equity
We generally issue long-term debt to refinance other long-term debt maturities and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, as well as to fund long-term capital investments and strategic opportunities. We have $300.0 million of long-term debt maturing in 2025, which we intend to refinance. 
For further information on our long-term debt, see 
Note 11 - Long-Term Debt and Finance Leases
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
We generally issue equity securities to fund long-term investment in our business. We evaluate our equity issuance needs to support our plan to maintain a 50 - 55 percent debt to total capital ratio excluding finance leases. 
For further information regarding equity, see 
Note 16 - Common Stock
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Credit Ratings
In general, less favorable credit ratings make debt financing more costly and more difficult to obtain on terms that are favorable to us and our customers, may impact our trade credit availability, and could result in the need to issue additional equity securities. Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and S&P Global Ratings (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate the agencies’ assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our debt. As of February 7, 2025, our current ratings with these agencies are as follows:

The pension and other postretirement benefit estimates reflect our expected cash contributions, which may be in excess of minimum funding requirements.
(3) Certain QFs require us to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $118 to $130 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation related to these QFs is approximately $229.0 million. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates authorized by the MPSC, totaling approximately $205.8 million.
(4) We have entered into various purchase commitments, largely purchased power, electric transmission, coal and natural gas supply and natural gas transportation contracts (exclusive of the qualifying facilities liability discussed above). These commitments range from one to 24 years.
 The energy supply costs incurred under these contracts are generally recoverable through rate mechanisms approved by the MPSC, as further described in 
Note 3 - Regulatory Matters
.

(7) The table above excludes potential tax payments related to unrecognized tax benefits as they are not practicable to estimate. Additionally, the table above excludes reserves for environmental remediation (See 
Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies
) and AROs (see 
Note 6 - Asset Retirement Obligations
) as the amount and timing of cash payments may be uncertain.
Other Obligations - 
As a co-owner of Colstrip, we provided surety bonds of approximately $15.8 million and $15.7 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to ensure the operation and maintenance of remedial and closure actions are carried out related to the Administrative Order on Consent Regarding Impacts Related to Wastewater Facilities Comprising the Closed-Loop System at Colstrip Steam Electric Stations, Colstrip Montana (the AOC) as required by the MDEQ. As costs are incurred under the AOC, the surety bonds will be reduced.
59
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
We have identified the policies and related procedures below that contain accounting estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Our operations are subject to the provisions of ASC 980, 
Regulated Operations 
(ASC 980). Our regulatory assets are the probable future revenues associated with certain costs to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process, including our estimate of amounts recoverable for natural gas and electric supply purchases. Regulatory liabilities are the probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. This accounting treatment is impacted by the uncertainties of our regulatory environment, anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact. If any part of our operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of ASC 980, or facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, we would record a charge to earnings, which could be material. In addition, we would need to determine if there was any impairment to the carrying costs of the associated plant and inventory assets.
While we believe that our assumptions regarding future regulatory actions are reasonable, different assumptions could materially affect our results. See 
Note 4 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
We sponsor and/or contribute to pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Our reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits, as described in 
Note 14 - Employee Benefit Plans
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are dependent upon numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, rate of return on plan assets and other economic conditions, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. As a result of these factors, significant portions of pension and other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect (and are generally greater than) the actual benefits provided to plan participants. Due to the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of the obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, the determination of these costs is considered a critical accounting estimate.
Assumptions
Key actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include:

•
Discount rates used in determining the future benefit obligations;
•
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and
•
Mortality assumptions.
We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. The assumptions are based upon market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate of future economic conditions.
We set the discount rate using a yield curve analysis, which projects benefit cash flows into the future and then discounts those cash flows to the measurement date using a yield curve. This is done by constructing a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities matches the year-by-year projected benefit cash flow from our plans. Based on this analysis as of December 31, 2024, our discount rate for both NorthWestern Energy SD/NE Pension Plan and NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan is 5.50 percent and 5.60 percent, respectively.
60
In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we review historical returns, the future expectations for returns for each asset class weighted by the target asset allocation of the pension and postretirement portfolios, and long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions are 4.58% percent and 6.17% percent on the NorthWestern Energy SD/NE Pension Plan and NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan, respectively, for 2025.

Accounting Treatment
We recognize the funded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are recognized into earnings only when the accumulated differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, which reduces the volatility of reported pension costs. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.
Due to the various regulatory treatments of the plans, our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Pension costs in Montana and other postretirement benefit costs in South Dakota are included in rates on a pay as you go basis for regulatory purposes. Pension costs in South Dakota and other postretirement benefit costs in Montana are included in rates on an accrual basis for regulatory purposes. Regulatory assets have been recognized for the obligations that will be included in future cost of service.
Income Taxes
Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Exposures exist related to various tax filing positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by taxing authorities. We have reduced deferred tax assets or established liabilities based on our best estimate of future probable adjustments related to these exposures. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate exposures in light of any additional information and make adjustments as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the future outcomes. We believe our deferred tax assets and established liabilities are appropriate for estimated exposures; however, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. The uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We have unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $9.6 million as of December 31, 2024. The resolution of tax matters in a particular future period could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and our cash flows. See 
Note 12 - Income Taxes
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
See 
Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein for a discussion of new accounting standards.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks, including, but not limited to, interest rates, energy commodity price volatility, and credit exposure. Management has established comprehensive risk management policies and procedures to manage these market risks.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. We manage our interest rate risk by issuing fixed-rate long-term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. All of our debt has fixed interest rates, with the exception of our revolving credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at rates equal to (a) SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 10.0 basis points, plus a margin of 100.0 to 175.0 basis points, or (b) a base rate, plus a margin of 0.0 to 75.0 basis points. As of December 31, 2024, we had $413.0 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. A 1.0 percent increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $4.1 million. 
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to commodity price risk due to our reliance on market purchases to fulfill a portion of our electric and natural gas supply requirements. We also participate in the wholesale electric market to balance our supply of power from our own generating resources. Several factors influence price levels and volatility. These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions, fuel availability, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations.
As part of our overall strategy for fulfilling our electric and natural gas supply requirements, we employ the use of market purchases and sales, including forward contracts. These types of contracts are included in our supply portfolios and in some instances, are used to manage price volatility risk by taking advantage of seasonal fluctuations in market prices. These contracts are part of an overall portfolio approach intended to provide price stability for consumers. As a regulated utility, our exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is mitigated because these commodity costs are included in our Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska cost tracking mechanisms and are recoverable from customers subject to a regulatory review for prudency and, in Montana, a sharing mechanism.
Counterparty Credit Risk
We are exposed to counterparty credit risk related to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations, and the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. If counterparties seek financial protection under bankruptcy laws, we are exposed to greater financial risks. We are also exposed to counterparty credit risk related to providing transmission service to our customers under our OATT and under gas transportation agreements. We have risk management policies in place to limit our transactions to high quality counterparties. We monitor closely the status of our counterparties and take action, as appropriate, to further manage this risk. This includes, but is not limited to, requiring letters of credit or prepayment terms. There can be no assurance, however, that the management tools we employ will eliminate the risk of loss.

We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and accumulated and reported to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of NorthWestern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page F-4.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of NorthWestern Energy Group, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NorthWestern Energy Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and common shareholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively, referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Regulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 4 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company accounts for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980, 
Regulated Operations. 
This guidance allows for the recording of a regulatory asset or liability for certain costs or credits which otherwise would be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the cost will be recovered or returned in future rates. 
The Company is subject to rate regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies (collectively, the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction over the Company’s electric and natural gas distribution rates in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. The Company assesses the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and the obligations arising from regulatory liabilities on a quarterly basis. Probability estimates incorporate numerous factors, including recent rate making decisions, historical precedents for similar matters, the regulatory environments in which the Company operates, and the impact that incurred costs may have on customers.
While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
F-1
As a result , we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include the recording of regulatory assets for certain costs which otherwise would be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the costs will be recovered in future rates and the recording of regulatory liabilities for certain credits which would otherwise be recognized in the statement of income or comprehensive income based on an expectation that the amount will be returned to customers in future rates. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.
•
We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.
•
We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, filings made by the Company, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•
We assessed management’s conclusion regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of NorthWestern Energy Group, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NorthWestern Energy Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Nature of Operations and Basis of Consolidation
NorthWestern Energy Group, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 
787,000
 customers in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Yellowstone National Park, through its subsidiaries NW Corp and NWE Public Service. We have generated and distributed electricity in South Dakota and distributed natural gas in South Dakota and Nebraska since 1923 and have generated and distributed electricity and distributed natural gas in Montana since 2002.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods included herein have been prepared by NorthWestern Energy Group (NorthWestern, we, or us), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts together with those of our wholly and majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements. Events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2024, have been evaluated as to their potential impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of issuance. 
Holding Company Reorganization
On January 1, 2024, we completed the second and final phase of our holding company reorganization. NW Corp contributed the assets and liabilities of its South Dakota and Nebraska regulated utilities to NWE Public Service, and then distributed its equity interest in NWE Public Service and certain other subsidiaries to NorthWestern Energy Group, resulting in NW Corp owning and operating the Montana regulated utility and NWE Public Service owning and operating the Nebraska and South Dakota utilities, each as a direct subsidiary of NorthWestern Energy Group.
(2) Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for such items as long-lived asset values and impairment charges, long-lived asset useful lives, tax provisions, unrecognized tax benefits, AROs, regulatory assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, our QF liability, environmental liabilities, unbilled revenues and actuarially determined benefit costs and liabilities. We revise the recorded estimates when we receive better information or when we can determine actual amounts. Those revisions can affect operating results.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue as customers obtain control of promised goods and services in an amount that reflects consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the delivery of electricity and natural gas results in the transfer of control to customers at the time the commodity is delivered and the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the amount billed to each customer, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred.
Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of 
three
 months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held in trust accounts to satisfy the requirements of certain stipulation agreements and insurance reserve requirements.
F-9
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable are net of allowances for uncollectible accounts of $
2.5
 million and $
2.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Receivables include unbilled revenues of $
95.2
 million and $
105.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Regulation of Utility Operations
Our regulated operations are subject to the provisions of ASC 980,
 Regulated Operations
. Regulated accounting is appropriate provided that (i) rates are established by or subject to approval by independent, third-party regulators, (ii) rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise's cost of service, and (iii) in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates are set at levels that will recover costs and can be charged to and collected from customers.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. The economic effects of regulation can result in regulated companies recording costs that have been, or are deemed probable to be, allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which the costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this occurs, costs are deferred as regulatory assets and recorded as expenses in the periods when those same amounts are reflected in rates. Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers (regulatory liabilities).
If we were required to terminate the application of these provisions to our regulated operations, all such deferred amounts would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. This would result in a charge to earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), net of applicable income taxes, which could be material. In addition, we would determine any impairment to the carrying costs of deregulated plant and inventory assets.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. All derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Additionally, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair-value hedge) or hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge). For fair-value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash-flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the cost or value of the underlying exposure is deferred in AOCL and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For other derivative contracts that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the underlying nature of the hedged items. As of December 31, 2024, the only derivative instruments we have qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. 

Revenues and expenses on contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time, and price is not tied to an unrelated underlying derivative. As part of our regulated electric and gas 
F-10
operations, we enter into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of our customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. If it were determined that a transaction designated as a normal purchase or a normal sale no longer met the exceptions, the fair value of the related contract would be reflected as an asset or liability and immediately recognized through earnings. See 
Note 8 - Risk Management and Hedging Activities
, for further discussion of our derivative activity.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost, including contracted services, direct labor and material, AFUDC, and indirect charges for engineering, supervision and similar overhead items. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs of utility property, plant and equipment are charged to the appropriate maintenance expense accounts. A betterment or replacement of a unit of property is accounted for as an addition and retirement of utility plant. At the time of such a retirement, the accumulated provision for depreciation is charged with the original cost of the property retired and also for the net cost of removal. Also included in plant and equipment are assets under finance lease, which are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments.
AFUDC represents the cost of financing construction projects with borrowed funds and equity funds. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it is realized under the ratemaking process over the service life of the related property through increased revenues resulting from a higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is included as a reduction to interest expense, while the equity component is included in other income. This rate averaged 
7.0
%, 
6.4
%, and 
6.4
% for Montana for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. This rate averaged 
6.9
%, 
6.4
%, and 
6.4
% for South Dakota and Nebraska for 
2024
, 2023, and 2022, respectively. AFUDC capitalized totaled $
27.1
 million, $
24.3
 million, and $
20.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, for Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska combined.
We record provisions for depreciation at amounts substantially equivalent to calculations made on a straight-line method by applying various rates based on useful lives of the various classes of properties (ranging from 
5
 to 
127
 years) determined from engineering studies. As a percentage of the depreciable utility plant at the beginning of the year, our provision for depreciation of utility plant was approximately 
2.9
% for 2024, and 
2.8
% for each of 2023 and 2022.
Depreciation rates include a provision for our share of the estimated costs to decommission our jointly owned plants at the end of the useful life. The annual provision for such costs is included in depreciation expense, while the accumulated provisions are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits
We have liabilities under defined benefit retirement plans and a postretirement plan that offers certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their dependents. The costs of these plans are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates, including determination of discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and mortality and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in material changes in the cost and liabilities we recognize.

Income Taxes
We follow the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Exposures exist related to various tax filing positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by taxing authorities. We have reduced deferred tax assets or established liabilities based on our best estimate of future probable adjustments related to these exposures. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate exposures in light of any additional information and make adjustments as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the future outcomes. We believe our deferred tax assets and established liabilities are appropriate for estimated exposures; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. The resolution of tax matters in a particular future period could have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statements and provision for income taxes.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 our production tax credits may be transferred to an unrelated entity. Our policy is to account for these transferable credits within income tax expense.

Environmental Costs
We record environmental costs when it is probable we are liable for the costs and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We may defer costs as a regulatory asset if there is precedent for recovering similar costs from customers in rates. Otherwise, we expense the costs. If an environmental cost is related to facilities we currently use, such as pollution control equipment, then we may capitalize and depreciate the costs over the remaining life of the asset, assuming the costs are recoverable in future rates or future cash flows.
Our remediation cost estimates are based on the use of an environmental consultant, our experience, our assessment of the current situation and the technology currently available for use in the remediation. We regularly adjust the recorded costs as we revise estimates and as remediation proceeds. If we are one of several designated responsible parties, then we estimate and record only our share of the cost.

Accounting Standards Issued
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which expands public entities' segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. We adopted this standard for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, as required, and used the retrospective method of adoption, with no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or internal controls. 
At this time, we are not expecting the adoption of recently issued accounting standards to have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
(3) Regulatory Matters
Montana Rate Review
In July 2024, we filed a Montana electric and natural gas rate review (2023 test year) with the MPSC. The filing requests a base rate annual revenue increase of $
156.5
 million ($
69.4
 million net with Property Tax and PCCAM tracker adjustments) for electric and $
28.6
 million for natural gas. Our request is based on a return on equity of 
10.80
 percent with a capital structure including 
46.81
 percent equity, and forecasted 2024 electric and natural gas rate base of $
3.45
 billion and $
731.9
 million, respectively. The electric rate base investment includes the 175-megawatt natural gas-fired Yellowstone County Generating Station, which was placed in service in October 2024. 
In November 2024, the MPSC partially approved our requested interim rates, which are subject to refund, increasing electric and natural gas base rates by $
18.4
 million and $
17.4
 million, respectively, and decreasing our PCCAM base costs by $
88.0
 million, effective December 1, 2024.
In January 2025, intervenor testimony was filed and we anticipate filing our rebuttal testimony in March 2025. Based on the procedural schedule developed by the MPSC, a hearing on our rate review request is scheduled to commence on April 22, 
F-13
2025. If a final order is not received by May 23, 2025, which is 270 days from acceptance of our filing, we intend to implement, as permitted by the MPSC regulations, our requested rates, which will be subject to refund, until a final order is received. 
South Dakota Natural Gas Rate Review
In June 2024, we filed a natural gas rate review (2023 test year) with the SDPUC for an annual increase to natural gas rates totaling approximately $
6.0
 million. Our request was based on a rate of return of 
7.75
 percent and rate base of $
95.6
 million. In December 2024, the SDPUC issued a final order approving the settlement agreement between NorthWestern and SDPUC Staff for an annual increase in base rates of approximately $
4.6
 million and an authorized rate of return of 
6.91
 percent. The approved settlement is based on a rate base of $
96.2
 million. Final rates were effective December 19, 2024. 
Nebraska Natural Gas Rate Review
In June 2024, we filed a natural gas rate review (2023 test year) with the NPSC. The filing requests a base rate annual revenue increase of $
3.6
 million. Our request is based on a return on equity of 
10.70
 percent, a capital structure including 
53.13
 percent equity, and rate base of $
47.4
 million. Interim rates, which increased base natural gas rates $
2.3
 million, were implemented on October 1, 2024. Interim rates will remain in effect on a refundable basis until the NPSC issues a final order.

(4) Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980, as discussed in 
Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
. Pursuant to this guidance, certain expenses and credits, normally reflected in income as incurred, are deferred and recognized when included in rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded based on our assessment that it is probable that a cost will be recovered or that an obligation has been incurred. Accordingly, we have recorded the following major classifications of regulatory assets and liabilities that will be recognized in expenses and revenues in future periods when the matching revenues are collected or refunded. Of these regulatory assets and liabilities, energy supply costs are the only items earning a rate of return. The remaining regulatory items have corresponding assets and liabilities that will be paid for or refunded in future periods.

Income Taxes
F-14
Flow-through income taxes primarily reflect the effects of plant related temporary differences such as flow-through of depreciation, repairs related deductions, and removal costs that we will recover or refund in future rates. We amortize these amounts as temporary differences reverse. Excess deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will be recovered or refunded in future rates. See 
Note 12 - Income Taxes
 for further discussion.
Pension and Employee Related Benefits
We recognize the unfunded portion of plan benefit obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is remeasured at each year end, with a corresponding adjustment to regulatory assets/liabilities as the costs associated with these plans are recovered in rates. The MPSC allows recovery of pension costs on a cash funding basis. The portion of the regulatory asset related to our Montana pension plan will amortize as cash funding amounts exceed accrual expense under GAAP. The SDPUC allows recovery of pension and postretirement benefit costs on an accrual basis. The MPSC allows recovery of postretirement benefit costs on an accrual basis.

Deferred Financing Costs
Consistent with our historical regulatory treatment, a regulatory asset has been established to reflect the remaining deferred financing costs on long-term debt that has been replaced through the issuance of new debt. These amounts are amortized over the life of the new debt.
Enhanced Wildfire Mitigation Plan
We have developed an Enhanced Wildfire Mitigation Plan addressing five key areas: situational awareness, operational practices, system preparedness, vegetation management, and public communications outreach. Because of ever-increasing wildfire risk, our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions, operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions, increased frequency of patrol and repairs, and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems. The MPSC has approved the deferral of incremental operating costs related to this Enhanced Wildfire Mitigation Plan. 
Supply Costs
The MPSC, SDPUC and NPSC have authorized the use of electric and natural gas supply cost trackers that enable us to track actual supply costs and either recover the under collection or refund the over collection to our customers. Accordingly, we have recorded a regulatory asset and liability to reflect the future recovery of under collections and refunding of over collections through the ratemaking process. We earn interest on natural gas supply costs under collected, or apply interest to an over collection, of 
6.7
 percent in Montana; 
6.8
 percent and 
6.9
 percent for electric and natural gas, respectively, in South Dakota; and 
8.5
 percent for natural gas in Nebraska. For our Montana electric supply tracker, the PCCAM, the interest rate we earn on supply costs under collected, or the interest rate we apply to an over collection, is based on the monthly interest rate for three month commercial paper as published by the Federal Reserve.
Environmental Clean-Up
Environmental clean-up costs are the estimated costs of investigating and cleaning up contaminated sites we own. We discuss the specific sites and clean-up requirements further in 
Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies
. Environmental clean-up costs are typically recoverable in customer rates when they are actually incurred. When cost projections become known and measurable, we coordinate with the appropriate regulatory authority to determine a recovery period. 
State & Local Taxes & Fees
Under Montana law, we are allowed to track the changes in the actual level of state and local taxes and fees and recover the increase, or refund the decrease, in rates, less the amount allocated to FERC jurisdictional customers and net of the related income tax benefit.
Removal Cost
The anticipated costs of removing assets upon retirement are collected from customers in advance of removal activity as a component of depreciation expense. Our depreciation method, including cost of removal, is established by the respective regulatory commissions. Therefore, consistent with this regulated treatment, we reflect this accrual of removal costs for our 
F-15
regulated assets by increasing our regulatory liability. See 
Note 6 - Asset Retirement Obligations
, for further information regarding this item.
Gas Storage Sales
A regulatory liability was established in 2000 and 2001 based on gains on cushion gas sales in Montana. This gain is being flowed to customers over a period that matches the depreciable life of surface facilities that were added to maintain deliverability from the field after the withdrawal of the gas. This regulatory liability is a reduction of rate base.

(1) The plant acquisition adjustment balance above includes our Beethoven wind project acquired in 2015, our hydro generating assets acquired in 2014, and the inclusion of our interest in Colstrip Unit 4 in rate base in 2009. The acquisition adjustment is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful life of each related asset in depreciation expense.
Net plant and equipment under finance lease were 
$
3.0 million
 and $
5.2 million
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is primarily comprised of a long-term power supply contract with the owners of a natural gas fired peaking plant, which has been accounted for as a finance lease.
Jointly Owned Electric Generating Plant
We have an ownership interest in 
four
 base-load electric generating plants, all of which are coal fired and operated by other companies. We have an undivided interest in these facilities and are responsible for our proportionate share of the capital and operating costs while being entitled to our proportionate share of the power generated. Our interest in each plant is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a pro rata basis and our share of operating expenses is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The participants each finance their own investment.
In January 2023 and July 2024, we entered into definitive agreements, the first with Avista and the second with Puget, to acquire their respective interests in Colstrip Units 3 & 4. In particular, we agreed to acquire a 
15
% (222 megawatts) interest from Avista and a 
25
% (370 megawatts) interest from Puget. Both agreements provide that the purchase price will be $
0
. These agreements are substantially similar and are both scheduled to close 
December 31, 2025
, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and approvals contained within the agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, we will be responsible for operating costs starting on January 1, 2026; while Puget and Avista will remain responsible for their respective pre-closing share of environmental and pension liabilities attributed to events or conditions existing prior to the closing of the transaction and for any future decommission and demolition costs associated with the existing facilities that comprise their interests.
Acquisition of Avista and Puget's interests would result in our ownership of 55 percent of the facility with the ability to guide operating and maintenance investments. This would provide capacity to help us meet our obligation to provide reliable and cost effective power to our customers in Montana, while allowing opportunity for us to identify and plan for newer lower or no-carbon technologies in the future.
F-16
Either party may terminate the respective separate agreement if any requested regulatory approval is denied or if the closing has not occurred by December 31, 2025 or if any law or order would delay or impair closing.

(6) Asset Retirement Obligations
We are obligated to dispose of certain long-lived assets upon their abandonment. We recognize a liability for the legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We measure the liability at fair value when incurred and capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the book value of the related assets, which increases our property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent liabilities. The increase in the capitalized cost is included in determining depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of these assets. Since the fair value of the ARO is determined using a present value approach, accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is recognized each period and recorded as a regulatory asset until the settlement of the liability. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. If the obligation is settled for an amount other than the carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a regulatory asset or liability for the difference, which will be surcharged/refunded to customers through the rate making process. We record regulatory assets and liabilities for differences in timing of asset retirement costs recovered in rates and AROs recorded since asset retirement costs are recovered through rates charged to customers.
Our AROs relate to the reclamation and removal costs at our jointly-owned coal-fired generation facilities, U.S. Department of Transportation requirements to cut, purge and cap retired natural gas pipeline segments, our obligation to plug and abandon oil and gas wells at the end of their life, and to remove all above-ground wind power facilities and restore the soil surface at the end of their life.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, our ARO liability decreased $
2.0
 million for partial settlement of the legal obligations at our jointly-owned coal-fired generation facilities and natural gas pipeline segments. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, our ARO liability decreased $
0.3
 million related to changes in both the timing and amount of retirement cost estimates.
In addition, we have identified removal liabilities related to our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets that have been installed on easements over property not owned by us. The easements are generally perpetual and only require remediation action upon abandonment or cessation of use of the property for the specified purpose. The ARO liability is not 
F-17
estimable for such easements as we intend to utilize these properties indefinitely. In the event we decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement, an ARO liability would be recorded at that time. We also identified AROs associated with our hydroelectric generating facilities; however, due to the indeterminate removal date, the fair value of the associated liabilities currently cannot be estimated and no amounts are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We collect removal costs in rates for certain transmission and distribution assets that do not have associated AROs. Generally, the accrual of future non-ARO removal obligations is not required; however, long-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions have allowed provisions for such costs in historical depreciation rates. The recorded amounts of costs collected from customers through depreciation rates are classified as a regulatory liability in recognition of the fact that we have collected these amounts that will be used in the future to fund asset retirement costs and do not represent legal retirement obligations. See 
Note 4 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
 for removal costs recorded as regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(7) Goodwill
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2024, and no impairment was identified. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units by considering various factors, including valuation studies based primarily on a discounted cash flow analysis, with published industry valuations and market data as supporting information. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in our service territory, regulatory stability, and commodity prices (where appropriate), as well as other factors that affect our revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.

(8) Risk Management and Hedging Activities
Nature of Our Business and Associated Risks

We are exposed to certain risks related to the ongoing operations of our business, including the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas commodities and changes in interest rates. We rely on market purchases to fulfill a portion of our electric and natural gas supply requirements. Several factors influence price levels and volatility. These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions, fuel availability, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations.
Objectives and Strategies for Using Derivatives
To manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices we routinely enter into derivative contracts. These types of contracts are included in our electric and natural gas supply portfolios and are used to manage price volatility risk by taking advantage of fluctuations in market prices. While individual contracts may be above or below market value, the overall portfolio approach is intended to provide greater price stability for consumers. We do not maintain a trading portfolio, and our derivative transactions are only used for risk management purposes consistent with regulatory guidelines. 
In addition, we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposures associated with new debt issuances or to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate debt.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
We evaluate new and existing transactions and agreements to determine whether they are derivatives. The permitted accounting treatments include: normal purchase normal sale (NPNS); cash flow hedge; fair value hedge; and mark-to-market.
F-18
Mark-to-market accounting is the default accounting treatment for all derivatives unless they qualify, and we specifically designate them, for one of the other accounting treatments. Derivatives designated for any of the elective accounting treatments must meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. The changes in the fair value of recognized derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction.
Normal Purchases and Normal Sales
We have applied the NPNS scope exception to our contracts involving the physical purchase and sale of gas and electricity at fixed prices in future periods. During our normal course of business, we enter into full-requirement energy contracts, power purchase agreements and physical capacity contracts, which qualify for NPNS. All of these contracts are accounted for using the accrual method of accounting; therefore, there were no unrealized amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenues and expenses from these contracts are reported on a gross basis in the appropriate revenue and expense categories as the commodities are received or delivered.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from counterparty non-performance under an agreement. We manage credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and exposure measurement, monitoring and mitigation. We limit credit risk in our commodity and interest rate derivatives activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. 
We are exposed to credit risk through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers. We may request collateral or other security from our counterparties based on the assessment of creditworthiness and expected credit exposure. It is possible that volatility in commodity prices could cause us to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties. We enter into commodity master enabling agreements with our counterparties to mitigate credit exposure, as these agreements reduce the risk of default by allowing us or our counterparty the ability to make net payments. The agreements generally are: (1) Western Systems Power Pool agreements – standardized power purchase and sales contracts in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements – standardized financial gas and electric contracts; (3) North American Energy Standards Board agreements – standardized physical gas contracts; and (4) Edison Electric Institute Master Purchase and Sale Agreements – standardized power sales contracts in the electric industry.
Many of our forward purchase contracts contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. If our credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties could require immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on contracts in net liability positions.
Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
We have previously used interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to manage our interest rate exposures associated with new debt issuances. We have no interest rate swaps outstanding. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of gains and losses, net of associated deferred income tax effects, recorded in AOCL. We reclassify these gains from AOCL into interest expense during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. 
The following table shows the effect of these interest rate swaps previously terminated on the Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands):

A pre-tax loss of approximately $
12.2
 million is remaining in AOCL as of December 31, 2024, and we expect to reclassify approximately $
0.6
 million of pre-tax losses from AOCL into interest expense during the next twelve months. These amounts relate to terminated swaps.
(9) Fair Value Measurements
F-19
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). Measuring fair value requires the use of market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Applicable accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value, and requires fair value measurements to be categorized based on the observability of those inputs. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2 – Pricing inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date; and
•
Level 3 – Significant inputs that are generally not observable from market activity.
We classify assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each individual asset and liability taken as a whole. Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings, the carrying amount of each such item approximates fair value. The table below sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the gross components of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NPNS transactions are not included in the fair values by source table as they are not recorded at fair value. See 
Note 8 - Risk Management and Hedging Activities
 for further discussion.
We record transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if necessary, at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels for the periods presented.

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies; however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we would realize in a current market exchange.

We determined fair value for long-term debt based on interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, except for publicly traded debt, for which fair value is based on market prices for the same or similar issues or upon the quoted market prices of U.S. treasury issues having a similar term to maturity, adjusted for our bond issuance rating and the present value of future cash flows. These are significant other observable inputs, or level 2 inputs, in the fair value hierarchy.
(10) Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Arrangements
Short-Term Borrowings
On April 12, 2024, NorthWestern Energy Group entered into a $
100.0
 million Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan) with a maturity date of 
April 11, 2025
. Borrowings may be made at a variable interest rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin as provided in the Term Loan. These proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan provides for prepayment of the principal and interest; however, amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Term Loan requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 
65
 percent or less. It also contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to engage in any consolidation or merger or otherwise liquidate or dissolve, dispose of property, and restricts certain affiliate transactions. A default on the South Dakota or Montana First Mortgage Bonds would trigger a cross default on the Term Loan; however a default on the Term Loan would not trigger a default on the South Dakota or Montana First Mortgage Bonds.
Credit Facility
On November 29, 2023, NW Corp amended its existing $
425.0
 million revolving credit facility (the Amended Facility) to address the holding company reorganization and extended the maturity date of the facility to 
November 29, 2028
. The Amended Facility does not amortize and is unsecured. Borrowings may be made at interest rates equal to (a) SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 
10.0
 basis points plus a margin of 
100.0
 to 
175.0
 basis points, or (b) a base rate, plus a margin of 
0.0
 to 
75.0
 basis points. After the completion of the holding company reorganization on January 1, 2024, NW Corp owns and operates only the Montana regulated utility, and the base capacity of the Amended Facility automatically reduced to $
400.0
 million. The Amended Facility has uncommitted features that allow NW Corp to request one-year extensions to the maturity date and increase the size of the Amended Facility by an additional $
100.0
 million. 
On January 24, 2025, NW Corp amended its existing $
400.0
 million Amended Facility to increase the capacity to $
425.0
 million. This amendment did not affect the maturity date or borrowing rates.
On March 25, 2023, we amended our existing $
25.0
 million swingline credit facility (the Swingline Facility) to extend the maturity date of the facility from March 27, 2024 to 
March 27, 2025
. The Swingline Facility does not amortize and is unsecured. Borrowings may be made at interest rates equal to (a) SOFR, plus a margin of 
90.0
 basis points, or (b) a base rate, plus a margin of 
12.5
 basis points. As of December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under this Swingline Facility.
On January 2, 2024, NW Corp terminated its $
100.0
 million Additional Credit Facility. On January 4, 2024, NW Corp terminated its $
25.0
 million Swingline Facility.
On November 29, 2023, NorthWestern Energy Group and its subsidiary, NWE Public Service, entered into a new $
200.0
 million unsecured revolver credit facility with base sublimits of $
50.0
 million for NorthWestern Energy Group and $
150.0

F-21
million for NWE Public Service (the HoldCo and NWE Public Service Credit Facility). The HoldCo and NWE Public Service Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 29, 2028. Upon the completion of the holding company reorganization on January 1, 2024, this credit facility became effective. The HoldCo and NWE Public Service Credit Facility has uncommitted features that allow both NorthWestern Energy Group and NWE Public Service to request one-year extensions to the maturity date and increase the size of the credit facility by an additional $
50
 million. The credit facility also gives us the flexibility to adjust the sublimits as needed, provided that NorthWestern Energy Group's base sublimit cannot exceed $
100.0
 million and NWE Public Service's sublimit cannot exceed $
200.0
 million. Borrowings may be made at interest rates equal to (a) SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 
10.0
 basis points plus a margin of 
100.0
 to 
175.0
 basis points, or (b) a base rate, plus a margin of 
0.0
 to 
75.0
 basis points.
Commitment fees for the unsecured revolving lines of credit were $

Secured Debt
First Mortgage Bonds and Pollution Control Obligations
The South Dakota First Mortgage Bonds are a series of general obligation bonds issued under our South Dakota indenture. These bonds are secured by substantially all of our South Dakota and Nebraska electric and natural gas assets. The South Dakota indenture was transferred from NW Corp to NWE Public Service upon the completion of the holding company reorganization on January 1, 2024.
The Montana First Mortgage Bonds are a series of general obligation bonds issued under our Montana indenture. These bonds are secured by substantially all of our Montana electric and natural gas assets.
On March 30, 2023, we issued and sold $
239.0
 million aggregate principal amount of Montana First Mortgage Bonds (the bonds) at a fixed interest rate of 
5.57
 percent maturing on

Our effective tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the regulatory impact of flowing through the federal and state tax benefit of repairs deductions, state tax benefit of accelerated tax depreciation deductions (including bonus depreciation when applicable), and production tax credits. The regulatory accounting treatment of these deductions requires immediate income recognition for temporary tax differences of this type, which is referred to as the flow-through method. When the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is reflected in regulated revenues, we record deferred income taxes and establish related regulatory assets and liabilities. 
The following table reconciles our effective income tax rate to the federal statutory rate:

In 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a safe harbor method of accounting for the repair and maintenance of natural gas transmission and distribution property. For the year ending December 31, 2024, after completion of our impact analysis of the gas repairs safe harbor method change, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $
7.0
 million related to tax deductions for repair costs that were previously capitalized in the 2022 and prior tax years.

As of December 31, 2024, our total federal NOL carryforward was approximately $
486.6
 million. Our federal NOL carryforward does not expire. Our state NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
391.2
 million. If unused, our state NOL carryforwards will expire in 2033. We believe it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize these NOL carryforwards.
At December 31, 2024, our total production tax credit carryforward was approximately $
97.7
 million. If unused, our production tax credit carryforwards will expire as follows: $
1.8
 million in 2035, $
10.9
 million in 2036, $
11.1

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
We recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 
50
 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.

Our unrecognized tax benefits include approximately $
7.4
 million and $
24.4
 million related to tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate. During the year ending December 31, 2024, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations we decreased our unrecognized tax benefits by $
16.9
 million.
 On April 14, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting for gas repairs expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we adopted this method 
F-27
and decreased our total unrecognized tax benefits by $
0.5
 million and recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $
3.2
 million for previously unrecognized tax ben
efits. In the next twelve months we expect the statute of limitations to expire for certain unrecognized tax benefits, which would result in a decrease to our total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $
9.4
 million.
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, we have accrued $
3.0
 million for the payment of interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, we had $
4.5
 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. 
Tax years 2021 and forward remain subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities. During the first quarter of 2023 the IRS commenced and concluded a limited scope examination of our 2019 amended federal income tax return. This examination resulted in a reduction to our previously claimed alternative minimum tax credit refund that is reflected in the table above.

(14) Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
We sponsor and/or contribute to pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans for eligible employees. The pension plan for our South Dakota and Nebraska employees is referred to as the NorthWestern Energy SD/NE Plan (formerly known as the NorthWestern Corporation Plan), the pension plan for our Montana employees is referred to as the NorthWestern Energy MT Plan (formerly known as the NorthWestern Energy Plan), and collectively they are referred to as the Plans. We utilize a number of accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are recognized into earnings only when the accumulated differences exceed 
10
 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. The Plans' funded status is recognized as an asset or liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See 
Note 4 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
, for further discussion on how these costs are recovered through rates charged to our customers.

(1) In October 2023, we entered into a group annuity contract from an insurance company to provide for the payment of pension benefits to select
 NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan participants. We purchased the contract with $
51.9
 million of plan assets in 2023. A trailing premium of $
0.8
 million related to final data reconciliation was paid from plan assets in 2024, reflecting a final, annuitized participant count of 276. The insurance company took over the payments of these benefits starting January 1, 2024. This transaction settled $
52.7
 million of our NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan obligation. As a result of this transaction, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a non-cash, non-operating settlement charge of $
4.4
 million. This charge is recorded within other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As discussed within 
Note 4 – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
, the MPSC allows recovery of pension costs on a cash funding basis. As such, this charge was deferred as a regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding decrease to operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
F-31
The actuarial gain/loss is primarily due to the change in discount rate assumption and actual asset returns compared with expected amounts. 
The total projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows (in millions):

(1) Settlement loss is related to partial annuitization of NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan effective October 24, 2023.
(2) Net periodic benefit costs for pension and postretirement benefit plans are recognized for financial reporting based on the authorization of each regulatory jurisdiction in which we operate. A portion of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as those costs are recovered through customer rates.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Service costs were recorded in Operations and maintenance expense while non-service costs were recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For purposes of calculating the expected return on pension plan assets, the market-related value of assets is used, which is based upon fair value. The difference between actual plan asset returns and estimated plan asset returns are amortized equally over a period not to exceed five years. 
F-32
Actuarial Assumptions
The measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measurements for the plans are December 31, 2024 and 2023. The actuarial assumptions used to compute net periodic pension cost and postretirement benefit cost are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, specifically, market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate of future economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions may impact future benefit costs and obligations. In computing future costs and obligations, we must make assumptions about such things as employee mortality and turnover, expected salary and wage increases, discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and expected future cost increases. Two of these assumptions have the most impact on the level of cost: (1) discount rate and (2) expected rate of return on plan assets. During 2022, the plan's actuary conducted an experience study to review five years of plan experience and update these assumptions.
On an annual basis, we set the discount rate using a yield curve analysis. This analysis includes constructing a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities matches the year-by-year, projected benefit cash flow from our plans. The increase in the discount rate during 2024 decreased our projected benefit obligation by approximately $
29.6
 million.
In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we review historical returns, the future expectations for returns for each asset class weighted by the target asset allocation of the pension and postretirement portfolios, and long-term inflation assumptions. Based on the target asset allocation for our pension assets and future expectations for asset returns, we decreased our long term rates of return on asset assumptions for the NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan and the NorthWestern Energy SD/NE Pension Plan to 
6.17
 percent and 
4.58
 percent, respectively, for 2025.
The weighted-average assumptions used in calculating the preceding information are as follows:

The postretirement benefit obligation is calculated assuming that health care costs increase by a 
5.00
 percent fixed rate. The company contribution toward the premium cost is capped, therefore future health care cost trend rates are expected to have a minimal impact on company costs and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. 
Investment Strategy
Our investment goals with respect to managing the pension and other postretirement assets are to meet current and future benefit payment needs while maximizing total investment returns (income and appreciation) after inflation within the constraints of diversification, prudent risk taking, Prudent Man Rule of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and liability-based considerations. Each plan is diversified across asset classes to achieve optimal balance between risk and return and between income and growth through capital appreciation. Our investment philosophy is based on the following:
•
Each plan should be substantially invested as long-term cash holdings reduce long-term rates of return;
•
Pension plan portfolio risk is described by volatility in the funded status of the Plans;
•
It is prudent to diversify each plan across the major asset classes;
•
Equity investments provide greater long-term returns than fixed income investments, although with greater short-term volatility;
•
Fixed income investments of the plans should strongly correlate with the interest rate sensitivity of the plan’s aggregate liabilities in order to hedge the risk of change in interest rates negatively impacting the pension plans overall funded status, (such assets will be described as Liability Hedging Fixed Income assets);
•
Allocation to foreign equities increases the portfolio diversification and thereby decreases portfolio risk while providing for the potential for enhanced long-term returns;
F-33
•
Private real estate and broad global opportunistic fixed income asset classes can provide diversification to both equity and liability hedging fixed income investments and that a moderate allocation to each can potentially improve the expected risk-adjusted return for the NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan investments over full market cycles;
•
Active management can reduce portfolio risk and potentially add value through security selection strategies;
•
A portion of plan assets should be allocated to passive, indexed management funds to provide for greater diversification and lower cost; and
•
It is appropriate to retain more than one investment manager, provided that such managers offer asset class or style diversification.
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the allocation between the various classes of securities available. The mix of assets is based on an optimization study that identifies asset allocation targets in order to achieve the maximum return for an acceptable level of risk, while minimizing the expected contributions and pension and postretirement expense. In the optimization study, assumptions are formulated about characteristics, such as expected asset class investment returns, volatility (risk), and correlation coefficients among the various asset classes, and making adjustments to reflect future conditions expected to prevail over the study period. 
Based on this, the target asset allocation established, within an allowable range of plus or minus 
5
 percent, is as follows:

(1) While the NorthWestern Energy Health and Welfare plan allocation of assets as of December 31, 2024, between Fixed income securities and Global equities is greater than 5 percent different from the target allocation, the plan Investment Manager has 60 days to correct this deviation from the plan. 
Generally, the asset mix will be rebalanced to the target mix as individual portfolios approach their minimum or maximum levels. The guidelines allow for a transition to targets over time as assets are reallocated to newly-approved asset classes of opportunistic fixed income and private real estate. Debt securities consist of U.S. and international instruments including emerging markets and high yield instruments, as well as government, corporate, asset backed and mortgage backed securities. While the portfolio may invest in high yield securities, the average quality must be rated at least “investment grade" by rating agencies. Equity, real estate and fixed income portfolios may be comprised of both active and passive management strategies. Performance of fixed income investments is measured by both traditional investment benchmarks as well as relative changes in the present value of the plan's liabilities. Equity investments consist primarily of U.S. stocks including large, mid and small cap stocks. We also invest in global equities with exposure to developing and emerging markets. Equity investments may also be diversified across investment styles such as growth and value. Derivatives, options and futures are permitted for the purpose of 
F-34
reducing risk but may not be used for speculative purposes. Real estate investments will consist of global equity or debt interests in tangible property consisting of land, buildings, and other improvements in commercial and residential sectors.
Our plan assets are primarily invested in common collective trusts (CCTs), which are invested in equity and fixed income securities. In accordance with our investment policy, these pooled investment funds must have an adequate asset base relative to their asset class and be invested in a diversified manner and have a minimum of three years of verified investment performance experience or verified portfolio manager investment experience in a particular investment strategy and have management and oversight by an investment advisor registered with the SEC. Investments in a collective investment vehicle are valued by multiplying the investee company’s net asset value per share with the number of units or shares owned at the valuation date. Net asset value per share is determined by the trustee. Investments held by the CCT, including collateral invested for securities on loan, are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a pricing service approved by the CCT’s investment manager, which determines valuations using methods based on quoted closing market prices on national securities exchanges, or at fair value as determined in good faith by the CCT’s investment manager if applicable. The funds do not contain any redemption restrictions. The direct holding of NorthWestern Energy Group stock is not permitted; however, any holding in a diversified mutual fund or collective investment fund is permitted. 
Cash Flows
In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), and the relief provisions of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WRERA), we are required to meet minimum funding levels in order to avoid required contributions and benefit restrictions. We have elected to use asset smoothing provided by the WRERA, which allows the use of asset averaging, including expected returns (subject to certain limitations), for a 24-month period in the determination of funding requirements. Additional funding relief was passed in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, providing for longer amortization and interest rate smoothing, which we elected to use. We expect to continue to make contributions to the pension plans in 2024 and future years that reflect the minimum requirements and discretionary amounts consistent with the amounts recovered in rates. Additional legislative or regulatory measures, as well as fluctuations in financial market conditions, may impact our funding requirements.
Due to the regulatory treatment of pension costs in Montana, pension costs for 
2024
, 2023 and 2022 were based on actual contributions to the NorthWestern Energy MT Pension Plan.

Defined Contribution Plan
Our defined contribution plan permits employees to defer receipt of compensation as provided in Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may elect to direct a percentage of their gross compensation to the plan. We also contribute various percentages of employees' gross compensation to the plan. Company contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 totaled $
14.7
 million, $
13.2
 million, and $
12.3
 million, respectively.

F-35
(15) Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock-based awards through our Amended and Restated Equity Compensation Plan (ECP), which includes restricted stock awards and performance share awards. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
558,300
 shares of common stock remaining available for grants. The remaining vesting period for awards previously granted ranges from one to 
three years
 if the service and/or performance requirements are met. Nonvested shares do not receive dividend distributions. The long-term incentive plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control.
We account for our share-based compensation arrangements by recognizing compensation costs for all share-based awards over the respective service period for employee services received in exchange for an award of equity or equity-based compensation. The compensation cost is based on the fair value of the grant on the date it was awarded. 
Performance Unit Awards
Performance unit awards are granted annually under the ECP. These awards vest at the end of the three-year performance period if we have achieved certain performance goals and the individual remains employed by us. The exact number of shares issued will vary from 
0 percent
 to 
200
 percent of the target award, depending on actual company performance relative to the performance goals. Beginning in 2023, these awards contain service-, market-, and performance-based components. The service-based component of these awards, representing 30 percent of the award, vest at the end of the three-year performance period as long as the individual has remained employed with us over that term. The performance goals are independent of each other and equally weighted at 35 percent of the award, and are based on two metrics: (i) EPS growth level and average return on equity; and (ii) total shareholder return relative to a peer group. Performance unit awards issued prior to 2023 included both the market- and performance-based components discussed above.
Fair value is determined for each component of the performance unit awards. The fair value of the service-based component is estimated based upon the closing market price of our common stock as of the grant date less the present value of expected dividends. The fair value of the performance-based component is estimated based upon the closing market price of our common stock as of the grant date less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple determined on the basis of historical experience, which is subsequently trued up at vesting based on actual performance. The fair value of the market-based component is estimated using a statistical model that incorporates the probability of meeting performance targets based on historical returns relative to the peer group. 
The following summarizes the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of performance shares and related compensation expense as well as the resulting estimated fair value of performance shares granted:

The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield of a three-year bond at the time of grant. The expected term of the performance shares is

Retirement/Retention Restricted Share Awards
In December 2011, an executive retirement / retention program was established that provides for the annual grant of restricted share units. Awards granted before 2022 are subject to a five-year performance and vesting period. The performance measure for these awards requires net income for the calendar year of at least three of the five full calendar years during the performance period to exceed net income for the calendar year the awards are granted. Awards granted in 2022 no longer contain this performance measure, instead these awards will vest after five full calendar years if the employee remains employed during that service period. No retirement/retention restricted shares were granted during the year ended December 31, 2024. Once vested, the awards will be paid out in shares of common stock in five equal annual installments after a recipient has separated from service. The fair value of these awards is measured based upon the closing market price of our common stock as of the grant date less the present value of expected dividends.

 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are reflected in treasury stock. These shares were credited to treasury stock based on their fair market value on the vesting date.
Dividend Restrictions
Due to our holding company structure, liquidity necessary to pay dividends to holders of our common stock is generally provided by dividend distributions from our utility subsidiaries. Under various state regulatory agreements, debt agreements and the Federal Power Act, our utility subsidiaries have restrictions, including minimum equity ratios, that limit the amount of dividend distributions that can be made. 
Pursuant to the MPSC regulatory agreement with NW Corp, if NW Corp's secured credit ratings are above BBB- for S&P Global Ratings and Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services, NW Corp may declare or pay dividends as long as NW Corp's common equity ratio is 
40
 percent or above. If NW Corp's secured credit ratings are BBB- for S&P Global Ratings or Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services, NW Corp may declare or pay dividends as long as NW Corp's common equity ratio is 
43
 percent or above. If NW Corp's secured credit ratings fall below BBB- with S&P Global Ratings or Baa3 with Moody's Investor Services, NW Corp may not declare or pay dividends to NorthWestern Energy Group.
NorthWestern Energy Group, NW Corp, and NWE Public Service's ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of various debt agreements, pursuant to which, NorthWestern Energy Group, NW Corp, and NWE Public Service are required to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 0.65 to 1.00. Further, the declaration of dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is not guaranteed. 
As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
784.6
 million and $
294.6
 million of NW Corp and NWE Public Service unrestricted net assets, respectively, were available for the payment of dividends to NorthWestern Energy Group under our most restrictive dividend restriction.
(17) Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of common stock equivalent shares that could occur if unvested shares were to vest. Common stock equivalent shares are calculated using the treasury stock method, as applicable. The dilutive effect is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of the outstanding unvested restricted stock and performance share awards. 
Average shares used in computing the basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

(18) Commitments and Contingencies
Qualifying Facilities Liability
Our QF liability primarily consists of unrecoverable costs associated with three contracts covered under the PURPA. These contracts require us to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $
118
 to $
130
 per MWH through 2029. As of December 31, 2024, our estimated gross contractual obligation related to these contracts was approximately $
229.0
 million through 2029. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates, totaling approximately $
205.8
 million through 2029. As contractual obligations are settled, the related purchases and sales are recorded within Fuel, purchased power and direct transmission expense and Electric revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The present value of the remaining liability is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our commitments under these contracts were $
345.8
 million in 2025, $
365.2
 million in 2026, $
350.4
 million in 2027, $
349.3
 million in 2028, $
350.2
 million in 2029, and $
2.5
 billion thereafter. These commitments are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Hydroelectric License Commitments
With the 2014 purchase of hydroelectric generating facilities and associated assets located in Montana, we assumed two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) existing with state, federal and private entities. The MOUs are periodically updated and renewed and require us to implement plans to mitigate the impact of the projects on fish, wildlife and their habitats, and to increase recreational opportunities. The MOUs were created to maximize collaboration between the parties and enhance the possibility to receive matching funds from relevant federal agencies. Under these MOUs, we have a remaining commitment to 
F-39
spend approximately $
19.1
 million between 2025 and 2040. These commitments are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REGULATION
Environmental Matters
The operation of electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities, and gas gathering, storage, transportation and distribution facilities, along with the development (involving site selection, environmental assessments, and permitting) and construction of these assets, are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and land use laws and regulations. Our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations that address emissions and impacts to the environment, including air and water, protection of natural resources, avian and wildlife. We monitor federal, state, and local environmental initiatives to determine potential impacts on our financial results. As new laws or regulations are implemented, our policy is to assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or their operation to maintain ongoing compliance.
Our environmental exposure includes a number of components, including remediation expenses related to the cleanup of current or former properties, and costs to comply with changing environmental regulations related to our operations. At present, our environmental reserve, which relates primarily to the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites owned by us or for which we are responsible, is estimated to range between $
19.0
 million to $
29.9
 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had a reserve of approximately $
23.7
 million, which has not been discounted. Environmental costs are recorded when it is probable we are liable for the remediation and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We use a combination of site investigations and monitoring to formulate an estimate of environmental remediation costs for specific sites. Our monitoring procedures and development of actual remediation plans depend not only on site specific information but also on coordination with the different environmental regulatory agencies in our respective jurisdictions; therefore, while remediation exposure exists, it may be many years before costs are incurred.
The following summarizes the change in our environmental liability (in thousands):

We are permitted to recover the remediation costs related to certain environmental liabilities within rates. Over time, as costs become determinable, we may seek authorization to recover additional costs in rates or seek insurance reimbursement as available and applicable; therefore, although we cannot guarantee regulatory recovery for all remediation costs, we do not expect these costs to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Manufactured Gas Plants
 - Approximately $
18.2
 million of our environmental reserve accrual is related to the following manufactured gas plants. 
South Dakota
 - A formerly operated manufactured gas plant located in Aberdeen, South Dakota, has been identified on the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System list as contaminated with coal tar residue. We are currently conducting feasibility studies, implementing remedial actions pursuant to work plans approved by the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and conducting ongoing monitoring and operation and maintenance activities. As of December 31, 2024, the reserve for remediation costs at this site was approximately $
7.2
 million, and we estimate that approximately $
2.1
 million of this amount will be incurred through 2029. The SDPUC permits the recovery of these costs within rates.
Nebraska
 - We own sites in North Platte, Kearney, and Grand Island, Nebraska on which former manufactured gas facilities were located. We are currently working independently to fully characterize the nature and extent of potential impacts associated with these Nebraska sites. Our reserve estimate includes assumptions for site assessment and remedial action work. 
F-40
At present, we cannot determine with a reasonable degree of certainty the nature and timing of any risk-based remedial action at our Nebraska locations.
Montana
 - We own or have responsibility for sites in Butte, Missoula, and Helena, Montana on which former manufactured gas plants were located. The Butte and Helena sites, both listed as high priority sites on Montana’s state superfund list, were placed into the MDEQ voluntary remediation program for cleanup due to soil and groundwater impacts. Soil and coal tar were removed at the sites in accordance with the MDEQ requirements. Groundwater monitoring is conducted semiannually at both sites. At this time, we cannot estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty the nature and timing of additional remedial actions and/or investigations, if any, at the Butte site. 
In August 2016, the MDEQ sent us a Notice of Potential Liability and Request for Remedial Action regarding the Helena site. In October 2019, we submitted a third revised Remedial Investigation Work Plan (RIWP) for the Helena site addressing MDEQ comments. The MDEQ approved the RIWP in March 2020 and field work was completed in 2022. We submitted a Remedial Investigation Report (RI Report) summarizing the work completed to MDEQ in March 2022 and are awaiting its review and comments as to any additional field work. We now expect the MDEQ review of the RI Report to be concluded in 2025, and any additional field work to commence following that. 
MDEQ has indicated it expects to proceed in listing the Missoula site as a Montana superfund site. After researching historical ownership, we have identified another potentially responsible party with whom we have entered into an agreement allocating third-party costs to be incurred in addressing the site. The other party has assumed the lead role at the site and has expressed its intention to submit a voluntary remediation plan for the Missoula site to MDEQ. At this time, we cannot estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty the nature and timing of risk-based remedial action, if any, at the Missoula site.
Global Climate Change -

National and international actions have been initiated to address global climate change and the contribution of GHG including, most significantly, carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and methane emissions from natural gas. These actions include legislative proposals, Executive, Congressional and EPA actions at the federal level, state level activity, investor activism and private party litigation relating to emissions. Coal-fired plants have come under particular scrutiny due to their level of emissions. We have joint ownership interests in four coal-fired electric generating plants, all of which are operated by other companies. We are responsible for our proportionate share of the capital and operating costs while being entitled to our proportionate share of the power generated.
EPA Rules 
-
 Congress has not passed any federal climate change legislation regarding GHG emissions from coal fired plants, and we cannot predict the timing or form of any potential legislation. Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) confers authority on EPA and the states to regulate emissions, including GHGs, from existing stationary sources. In April 2024, the EPA released final rules related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards (GHG Rules) for existing coal-fired facilities and new coal and natural gas-fired facilities as well as final rules strengthening the MATS requirements (MATS Rules). In particular, the GHG Rules will (i) strengthen the current New Source Performance Standards for newly built fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines (generally natural gas-fired); (ii) establish emission guidelines for states to follow in limiting carbon pollution from existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating electric generating units (including coal, oil and natural gas-fired units); and (iii) establish emission guidelines for large, frequently used existing fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines (generally natural gas-fired). The MATS Rules will strengthen emission limits for acid gases, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants from new and existing electric generating units. Compliance with the rules will require expensive upgrades at Colstrip Units 3 and 4 with proposed compliance dates that may not be achievable and / or require technology that is unproven, resulting in significant impacts to costs of the facilities. The final MATS and GHG Rules require compliance as early as 2027 and 2032, respectively. 
Previous efforts by the EPA were met with extensive litigation, and this time is no different. We, along with many other utilities, electric cooperatives, organizations, and states, have petitioned for judicial review of the GHG and MATS Rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The United States Supreme Court denied multiple stay requests related to the MATS and GHG Rules. The litigation on the merits continues for both the MATS and GHG Rules in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and decisions are expected in 2025. If the MATS Rule and GHG Rule are ultimately enforced, it would result in additional material compliance costs. We will continue working with federal and state regulatory authorities, other utilities, and stakeholders to seek relief from the MATS and GHG regulations that, in our view, disproportionately impact customers in our region.
These GHG and MATS Rules as well as future additional environmental requirements - federal or state - could cause us to incur material costs of compliance, increase our costs of procuring electricity, decrease transmission revenue and impact cost recovery. Technology to efficiently capture, remove and/or sequester such GHG emissions or hazardous air pollutants may not be available within a timeframe consistent with the implementation of any such requirements.
F-41
Regional Haze Rules

-
 In January 2017, the EPA published amendments to the requirements under the CAA for state plans for protection of visibility - regional haze rules. Among other things, these amendments revised the process and requirements for the state implementation plans and extended the due date for the next periodic comprehensive regional haze state implementation plan revisions from 2018 to 2021.
The states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota have developed and submitted to the EPA, for its approval, their respective State Implementation Plans (SIP) for Regional Haze compliance. While these states, among others, did not meet the EPA’s July 31, 2021, submission deadline, they were all submitted in 2022. The Montana SIP as drafted and submitted to EPA does not call for additional controls for our interest in Colstrip Unit 4. The draft North Dakota SIP does not require any additional controls at the Coyote generating facility. Similarly, the draft South Dakota SIP does not require any additional controls at the Big Stone generating facility. Until these SIPs are finalized and approved by EPA, the potential remains that installation of additional emissions controls might be required at these facilities.
Jointly Owned Plants

-
 We have joint ownership in generation plants located in South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, and Montana that are or may become subject to the various regulations discussed above that have been or may be issued or proposed.
Other

-
 We continue to manage equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) oil in accordance with the EPA's Toxic Substance Control Act regulations. We will continue to use certain PCB-contaminated equipment for its remaining useful life and will, thereafter, dispose of the equipment according to pertinent regulations that govern the use and disposal of such equipment.
We routinely engage the services of a third-party environmental consulting firm to assist in performing a comprehensive evaluation of our environmental reserve. Based upon information available at this time, we believe that the current environmental reserve properly reflects our remediation exposure for the sites currently and previously owned by us. The portion of our environmental reserve applicable to site remediation may be subject to change as a result of the following uncertainties:
•
We may not know all sites for which we are alleged or will be found to be responsible for remediation; and
•
Absent performance of certain testing at sites where we have been identified as responsible for remediation, we cannot estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty the total costs of remediation.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
State
 of Montana - Riverbed Rents
On April 1, 2016, the State of Montana (State) filed a complaint on remand (the State’s Complaint) with the Montana First Judicial District Court (State District Court), naming us, along with Talen Montana, LLC (Talen) as defendants. The State claimed it owns the riverbeds underlying 10 of our, and formerly Talen’s, hydroelectric facilities (dams, along with reservoirs and tailraces) on the Missouri, Madison and Clark Fork Rivers, and seeks rents for Talen’s and our use and occupancy of such lands. The facilities at issue include the Hebgen, Madison, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, and Morony facilities on the Missouri and Madison Rivers and the Thompson Falls facility on the Clark Fork River. We acquired these facilities from Talen in November 2014.
The litigation has a long prior history. In 2012, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision holding that the Montana Supreme Court erred in not considering a segment-by-segment approach to determine navigability and relying on present day recreational use of the rivers. It also held that what it referred to as the Great Falls Reach “at least from the head of the first waterfall to the foot of the last” was not navigable for title purposes, and thus the State did not own the riverbeds in that segment. The United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the Montana Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. Following the 2012 remand, the case laid dormant for four years until the State’s Complaint was filed with the State District Court. On April 20, 2016, we removed the case from State District Court to the United States District Court for the District of Montana (Federal District Court). On August 1, 2018, the Federal District Court granted our and Talen’s motions to dismiss the State’s Complaint as it pertains to the navigability of the riverbeds associated with four of our hydroelectric facilities near Great Falls. A bench trial before the Federal District Court commenced January 4, 2022, and concluded on January 18, 2022, which addressed the issue of navigability concerning our other six facilities. On August 25, 2023, the Federal District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (the "Order"), which found all but one of the segments of the riverbeds in dispute not navigable, and thus not owned by the State of Montana. The one segment found navigable, and thus owned by the State, was the segment on which the Black Eagle development was located. The State filed a motion to pursue an interlocutory appeal of the Order, and on January 2, 2024, the Federal District Court certified the Order for appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was argued on January 15, 2025, and we await the court's disposition. Damages were bifurcated by agreement and will be tried separately for the Black Eagle segment, and any other segments found navigable, should the State prevail on appeal.
We dispute the State’s claims and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. If the Federal District Court calculates damages as the State District Court did in 2008, we do not anticipate the resulting annual rent for the Black Eagle segment would have a material impact to our financial position or results of operations. We anticipate that any obligation to pay the State rent for use and occupancy of the riverbeds would be recoverable in rates from customers, although there can be no assurances that the MPSC would approve any such recovery.
Yellowstone County Generating Station Air Permit
On October 21, 2021, the Montana Environmental Information Center and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in Montana State District Court, against the MDEQ and NorthWestern, alleging that the environmental analysis conducted by MDEQ prior to issuance of the YCGS air quality construction permit was inadequate. On April 4, 2023, the Montana District Court issued an order finding MDEQ's environmental analysis was deficient in not addressing exterior lighting and greenhouse gases and remanded it back to MDEQ to address the deficiencies and vacated the YCGS air quality permit pending that remand. As a result of the vacatur of the permit, we paused construction. On June 8, 2023, the Montana District Court granted our motion to stay the order vacating the air quality permit pending the outcome of our appeal to the Montana Supreme Court. We recommenced YCGS construction in June 2023 and placed the plant in service in October 2024. On January 3, 2025, the Montana Supreme Court ordered that the YCGS air quality permit be reinstated. The Court remanded the matter back to MDEQ for supplemental analysis regarding lighting and greenhouse gas emissions in Montana. YCGS is commercially operable with the reinstated air quality permit. 
Other Legal Proceedings
We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, governmental audits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these other actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
F-43
(19) Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Accounting Policy
Our revenues are primarily from tariff based sales. We provide gas and/or electricity to customers under these tariffs without a defined contractual term (at-will). As the revenue from these arrangements is equivalent to the electricity or gas supplied and billed in that period (including estimated billings), there will not be a shift in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for such sales. We have also completed the evaluation of our other revenue streams, including those tied to longer term contractual commitments. These revenue streams have performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, and do not have a shift in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition. 
Customers are billed monthly on a cycle basis. To match revenues with associated expenses, we accrue unbilled revenues for electric and natural gas services delivered to customers, but not yet billed at month-end.
Nature of Goods and Services
We currently provide retail electric and natural gas services to three primary customer classes. Our largest customer class consists of residential customers, which include single private dwellings and individual apartments. Our commercial customers consist primarily of main street businesses, and our industrial customers consist primarily of manufacturing and processing businesses that turn raw materials into products.
Electric Segment

- Our regulated electric utility business primarily provides generation, transmission, and distribution services to our customers in our Montana and South Dakota jurisdictions. We recognize revenue when electricity is delivered to the customer. Payments on our tariff based sales are generally due in 20-30 days after the billing date.
Natural Gas Segment - 
Our regulated natural gas utility business primarily provides production, storage, transmission, and distribution services to our customers in our Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska jurisdictions. We recognize revenue when natural gas is delivered to the customer. Payments on our tariff based sales are generally due in 20-30 days after the billing date.
