Overview

General

We are an oncology company developing innovative antibody therapeutics. Our pipeline of full-length human multispecific antibody candidates is generated from our proprietary technology platforms, which are able to generate a diverse array of antibody binding domains, or Fabs, against virtually any target. Our antibody binding domain generally consists of a target-specific heavy chain paired with a common light chain. Multiple binding domains can be combined to produce novel multispecific antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets and display novel and innovative biology. These platforms, referred to as Biclonics® and Triclonics®, allow us to generate large numbers of diverse panels of bispecific and trispecific antibodies (Multiclonics®), respectively, which can then be functionally screened in large-scale cell-based assays to identify those unique molecules that possess novel biology, which we believe are best suited for a given therapeutic application. Further, by binding to multiple targets, Biclonics® and Triclonics® may be designed to provide a variety of mechanisms of action, including simultaneously blocking receptors that drive tumor cell growth and survival and mobilizing the patient’s immune response by engaging T cells, and/or activating various killer cells to eradicate tumors. Our Multiclonics
®
 are compatible with a range of linkers and payloads to generate antibody-drug conjugates (ADClonics
®
) capable of binding two or three different targets with the potential for improved binding selectivity, internalization and cancer cell killing activity.

Our technology platforms employ an assortment of patented technologies and techniques to generate human antibodies. We utilize our patented MeMo® mouse to produce a host of antibodies with diverse heavy chains and a common light chain that are capable of binding to virtually any antigen target. We use our patented heavy chain and CH3 domain dimerization technology to generate substantially pure bispecific and trispecific antibodies. We employ our patented Spleen to Screen® technology to efficiently screen panels of diverse heavy chains, designed to allow us to rapidly identify Biclonics® and Triclonics® therapeutic candidates with differentiated modes of action for pre-clinical and clinical testing. We use our patented Triclonics® format to generate multispecific antibodies capable of binding to three different epitopes or antigens.

The FDA approved BIZENGRI
®
 (zenocutuzumab-zbco), the first and only treatment indicated for adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or NSCLC that are advanced, unresectable or metastatic and harbor a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusion who have disease progression on or after prior systemic therapy. Using our Biclonics® platform we have produced, and are currently developing, the following candidates: MCLA-128 (zenocutuzumab), which we are exploring for potential other development opportunities beyond NRG1 fusion; MCLA-158 (petosemtamab) for the potential treatment of solid tumors, including 1L PD-L1+ r/m HNSCC in combination with pembrolizumab, and 2/3L r/m HNSCC as monotherapy; and in mCRC in 1L and 2L in combination with standard chemotherapy and 3L+ mCRC as monotherapy; MCLA-129, for the potential treatment of lung and other solid tumors, which is subject to a collaboration and license agreement, which permits Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta) to exclusively commercialize MCLA-129 in China, if approved, while Merus retains full ex-China rights. Furthermore, we have a pipeline of proprietary antibody candidates in pre-clinical development and intend to further leverage our ADClonics®, Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms to identify multispecific antibody candidates and multispecific ADCs and advance them into clinical development.

Funding Our Operations

We are an oncology company and have not yet generated any revenue from product sales. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our antibody candidates from discovery through pre-clinical development and into clinical trials and seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved antibody candidate. We have

100

exclusively licensed to PTx the right to commercialize BIZENGRI
®
 (zenocutuzumab-zbco), in the United States, as the first and only treatment indicated for adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or NSCLC that are advanced unresectable or metastatic and harbor a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusion who have disease progression on or after prior systemic therapy. Beyond zenocutuzumab, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our other antibody candidates, if appropriate, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, and compliance.

We anticipate that we will require additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations, business development and licensing opportunities with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, the trading prices for our and other biopharmaceutical companies’ stock have been highly volatile as a result of the United States political environment, disruptions and extreme volatility in the global economy, including rising inflation and interest rates, declines in economic growth, global instability including the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common shares and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms. See “The price of our common shares may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.

Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $724.0 million as of December 31, 2024 will fund our operations into 2028. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, particularly as the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.

Clinical Programs

Petosemtamab (MCLA-158: EGFR x LGR5 Biclonics
®
): Solid Tumors

Phase 3 registrational trial investigating petosemtamab in combination with pembrolizumab in 1L PD-L1+ r/m head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the LiGeR-HN1 trial, and phase 3 registrational trial investigating petosemtamab monotherapy in 2/3L HNSCC, the LiGeR-HN2 trial, are enrolling; phase 2 trial in 1L and 2L metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) cohort of petosemtamab in combination with standard chemotherapy, and in 3L+ mCRC as monotherapy are enrolling; a clinical update on the phase 2 investigation of petosemtamab in 1L r/m PD-L1+ HNSCC is planned for the first half 2025, and a clinical update on petosemtamab in mCRC is planned for the second half of 2025.

We have confirmed through feedback with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") that petosemtamab 1500 mg every two weeks is appropriate for further development in HNSCC as monotherapy, and in combination with pembrolizumab.

In June 2024 we provided an interim clinical data  from the ongoing  phase 1/2 trial of petosemtamab with pembrolizumab in 1L PDL1+ r/m HNSCC at the 2024 ASCO
®
 Annual Meeting. As of a March 6, 2024 data cutoff, 45 patients (pts) were treated. The efficacy population consisted of 4 pts who had been treated by November 6, 2023, who had the opportunity for 4 or more months follow up, with ≥2 treatment cycles and ≥1 post-baseline tumor assessment; or who discontinued early due to disease progression or death. Two pts were not included: One pt withdrew consent prior to first tumor assessment and the other pt discontinued due to toxicity with less than 2 cycles of treatment. The response rate overall (N=24) was 67%, including 1 confirmed complete response (CR), 12 confirmed partial responses (PRs) and 3 unconfirmed PRs (all of whom confirmed after the data cutoff) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. per investigator assessment. Responses were observed regardless of HPV status, 3 of 4 pts with HPV associated cancer responded, and across PD-L1+ levels treated (CPS 1-19: 60% [6/10]; CPS ≥ 20: 71% [10/14]). At the time of data cutoff, 32 pts of the 45 enrolled, remained on treatment, including 14 of 16 responders and 18 of the initial 26 pts enrolled. For the 45 pts treated median follow up was 3.6 months.The combination was well tolerated and no significant overlapping toxicities with pembrolizumab were observed and treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 45 pts. Most were Grade (G) 1 or 2 in severity (no G4–5 were observed). Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (composite term) were reported in 38% (all Gs) and 7% (G3) of pts, most occurred during the first infusion and resolved. We plan to provide updated efficacy, durability and safety data from this cohort in the first half of 2025.

In July 2024, we announced the first patient was dosed in LiGeR-HN2, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of petosemtamab in r/m 2/3L HNSCC compared to standard of care. In this trial, patients will be randomized to petosemtamab monotherapy or investigator’s choice of single agent chemotherapy or cetuximab.

In September 2024, we announced the first patient was dosed in LiGeR-HN1, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of petosemtamab in combination with pembrolizumab in 1L r/m HNSCC expressing PD-L1 (CPS≥1). In this trial, patients will be randomized to petosemtamab and pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy.

101

We believe a randomized registration trial in HNSCC with an overall response rate endpoint could potentially support accelerated approval and the overall survival results from the same study could potentially verify its clinical benefit to support regular approval.

In December 2024, we shared clinical data on petosemtamab monotherapy in patients with previously treated r/m HNSCC at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO
®
) Asia Congress. In this presentation, we presented updated clinical data from the ongoing phase 1/2 trial of petosemtamab in previously treated HNSCC, previously presented at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023, in Orlando, Florida
. 
This presentation also included 
c
linical data from the dose optimization cohort evaluating petosemtamab monotherapy 1500 or 1100 mg dose levels in 2L+ HNSCC.

As of the July 5, 2024 data cutoff date, 82 previously treated HNSCC pts were treated with petosemtamab 1500 mg intravenously every two weeks. The efficacy population consists of 75 pts who had the opportunity for 4 or more months follow up and ≥1 post-baseline tumor assessment; or who discontinued early due to disease progression or death. Seven pts were not efficacy evaluable: 6 pts previously described at AACR 2023 (5 pts withdrew due to IRR on day 1 and 1 pt with exclusion criteria deviation) and 1 additional pt withdrew due to IRR on day 1. Confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was 36% (90% CI: 27–46; 27/75) by RECIST v1.1. per investigator assessment, including 4 CRs, with one CR continuing on treatment for more than 3 years as of the data cutoff. Responses were also reported in HPV associated cancer, ORR was 13% (2/15) and 5 additional pts achieved stable disease. At the time of data cutoff, 10 pts remained on treatment including 8 responders and 2 pts with stable disease. Median duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.2, 4.9 and 11.4 months. For the most mature data set, the single arm cohort previously presented at AACR 2023, as of a July 5, 2024 data cutoff, for all 54 patients, the median DOR, PFS and OS were 6.7, 5.1, and 12.0 months, respectively and among the 48 treatment evaluable subset, they were 6.7, 5.2, and 12.5 months, respectively. In 82 pts, petosemtamab 1500 mg every two weeks continues to be well tolerated with a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals observed. IRRs were predominantly seen on day 1 of cycle 1 and a clinically meaningful reduction in the incidence and severity of IRR was observed with an updated administration regimen compared to that used as of the 2023 AACR presentation.

In July 2024, the first patient was dosed in a phase 2 trial evaluating petosemtamab in combination with standard chemotherapy in second line (2L) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and in December 2024 the first patient was dosed in a phase 2 trial evaluating petosemtamab monotherapy in heavily pretreated (3L+) mCRC. We have also started dosing patients in a cohort evaluated petosemtamab in combination with standard chemotherapy in 1L mCRC. We plan to present initial clinical data on the investigation of petosemtamab in mCRC in the second half of 2025.

In August 2023, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody.  Fast Track is a designation designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs.

In May 2024, the FDA also granted BTD for petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with r/m HNSCC whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody.

In February 2025, the FDA granted a second BTD for petosemtamab in combination with pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of adult patients with r/m PD-L1 positive HNSCC with CPS ≥ 1.

Zenocutuzumab, or “Zeno” (MCLA-128: HER3 x HER2 Biclonics
®
): NRG1 gene fusion (NRG1+) cancers and other solid tumors
 BIZENGRI
®
 (zenocutuzumab-zbco), obtained FDA accelerated approval as the first and only treatment indicated for adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or NSCLC that are advanced unresectable or metastatic and harbor a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusion who have disease progression on or after prior systemic therapy.

In December 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Partner Therapeutics, Inc. (PTx), a private, fully-integrated biotechnology company with a focus in hematology and oncology, in which we exclusively licensed to PTx the right to commercialize zenocutuzumab (Zeno) for the treatment of NRG1 fusion-positive (NRG1+) cancer in the United States (U.S.).

We are conducting ongoing translational work on potential biomarkers outside of NRG1+ cancer and other potential development opportunities, which may support investigation of Zeno in additional areas of unmet need beyond NRG1+ cancer.

MCLA-129 (EGFR x c-MET Biclonics
®
): Solid Tumors

Investigation of MCLA-129 continues in MET ex14 NSCLC expansion cohort in the phase 1/2 trial; MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC is ongoing.

MCLA-129 is in clinical development in a global, phase 1, open-label, clinical trial evaluating MCLA-129 in patients with c-MET exon 14 skipping mutations (METex14), and we continue to monitor and evaluate patients on treatment.

102

We are also enrolling patients in the phase 2 trial evaluating MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFRm NSCLC, with a cohort receiving MCLA-129 and paclitaxel and carboplatin, and another cohort receiving MCLA-129 and docetaxel.

We remain interested in exploring partnering MCLA-129 to sufficiently resource the development of MCLA-129 and the potential benefit it may have for patients.

MCLA-129 is subject to a collaboration and license agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta), which permits Betta to develop MCLA-129 and potentially commercialize exclusively in China, while we retain global rights outside of China.

Our revenue from each collaborator consists of revenue recognized from the amortization of deferred revenue related to upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, research and development services reimbursement revenue earned and milestone payments earned under collaboration and license agreements with our collaboration partners.

Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $7.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of decreases in Lilly revenue of $8.4 million and Incyte revenue of $6.4 million, offset by increases in Gilead revenue of $4.8 million, and Other revenue of 2.2 million. The decrease in Lilly revenue is primarily the result of decreases in upfront payment amortization of $4.8 million and reimbursement revenue of $3.6 million. The decrease in Incyte revenue is primarily the result of decreases in milestone revenue of $5.0 million and reimbursement revenue of $1.4 million. Gilead revenue increased due to the start of the collaboration agreement in 2024 which resulted in an increase in upfront payment amortization of $4.8 million. The increase in Other revenue is primarily the result of increases in milestone revenue of $2.1 million.

As of December 31, 2024, we had total deferred revenue of $69.4 million, which primarily relates to the upfront payments received under our Gilead collaboration agreement and our Incyte collaboration agreement. The remaining deferred revenue of $51.3 million from the Gilead collaboration agreement is expected to be recognized over time using an output method of progress toward the development of the program target. The remaining deferred revenue of $17.6 million from the Incyte collaboration agreement is expected to be recognized over the next two years.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development costs consist principally of the costs associated with our research and development activities, conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and activities related to our regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:

•
salaries for research and development staff and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses;

•
expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants that conduct and support clinical trials and pre-clinical studies;

•
costs to enhance our platform technologies, develop product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, and facility related expenses; and

•
amortization and depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets used to develop our product candidates.

Note that we do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs under research and development and, as such, are separately classified as unallocated research and development expenses.

Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $84.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in external clinical services and drug manufacturing costs of $66.6 million, which includes costs to advance our research pipeline and costs to fulfill our obligations under our collaboration agreements related to our programs, increases in personnel related expenses including share-based compensation of $11.8 million due to an increase in employee headcount and an increase in share price, consultancy expenses of $5.5 million, facilities expenses and other related expenses of $0.7 million, and consumables expenses of $0.2 million, offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization of $0.1 million.

104

Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs for the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our platform technologies, our development programs progress, as we continue to support the clinical trials of our antibody candidates as treatments for various cancers and as we move these candidates into additional clinical trials. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our antibody candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our clinical development programs and plans.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including share-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal and intellectual property, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including intellectual property and general legal services.

General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $23.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in personnel related expenses including share-based compensation of $12.6 million due to an increase in employee headcount and an increase in share price, consultancy expenses of $6.8 million, legal expenses of $1.8 million, facilities and depreciation expense of $1.2 million, and intellectual property and licenses expenses of $0.7 million, partially offset by decreases in finance and human resources expenses of $0.1 million.

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we grow as a company, driven by the need to support a growing workforce, engaging in financing transactions, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property rights, fulfilling our compliance requirements as a public company and related legal, regulatory and potential commercialization costs.

We are subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and the U.S. Our current and deferred tax provision represents taxable income attributed to our U.S. operations as a consequence of allocating income to that jurisdiction. No current or deferred provision for income taxes has been made for income taxes in the Netherlands due to losses for tax purposes. Further, given a history of losses in the Netherlands, no deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities are recognized as it is not more likely than not that they will be recovered.

Income tax expense increased primarily due to an increase in book income before tax and an increase in permanent differences due to increases in stock option exercises.

Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $215.3 million, compared to $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in net loss of $60.4 million was primarily due to the changes in collaboration revenue, changes in operating expenses, and changes in other income, net, as discussed above..

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash requirements

We require external sources of financing to fund our operations. Since inception through December 31, 2024, we have raised an aggregate of $1,674.9 million, of which $221.8 million was non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $1,342.4 million was from the sale of common shares and $110.7 million was from private funding sources prior to our initial public offering.

These amounts include aggregate immediate proceeds from the closing of the collaboration and license agreement and share purchase agreement with Eli Lilly in January 2021 of $60.0 million, the aggregate net proceeds from the January 2021 follow-on offering of $129.4 million, the aggregate net proceeds from the November 2021 follow-on offering of $118.7 million, the aggregate net proceeds during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 from the "at the market" offering program pursuant to an Open Market Sale Agreement (the 2021 Sales Agreement) with Jefferies LLC of $57.7 million and $63.8 million, respectively, 
[A1] [A2] 
the aggregate net proceeds from the August 2023 underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Guggenheim Securities, LLC and William Blair & Company, L.L.C., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, of $162.2 million, aggregate net proceeds from the closing of the Gilead collaboration agreement in March 2024 of $81.0 million, and the aggregate net proceeds from the May 2024 underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Leerink Partners LLC, Guggenheim Securities, LLC and BMO Capital Markets Corp., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, of $434.9 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $724.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that are available to fund our current and future operations.

In February 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “2024 Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies") to sell from time to time up to $300 million of our common shares through an “at-the-market” offering program under which Jefferies acts as the sales agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2024 Sales Agreement, Jefferies can sell the common shares by any method deemed to be an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. There have been no sales under the 2024 Sales Agreement through December 31, 2024.

On March 5, 2024, we entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement (“Gilead Collaboration Agreement”) and Share Subscription Agreement (the “Gilead Subscription Agreement”) with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”). Under the terms of the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we and Gilead agreed to collaborate on the use of Merus’ proprietary Triclonics® platform to develop certain trispecific T-cell engaging multi-specific antibody products for the treatment of certain indications. The collaboration shall include at least two, but may include up to three, separate preclinical research programs (each, a “Program”) for the design and validation of candidates directed to the applicable program targets selected by Gilead. On a Program-by-Program basis, we have granted Gilead an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license for such Program. If Gilead exercises the license option with respect to a Program, Gilead will be responsible for the development and commercialization of the products arising from such Program. Gilead paid an upfront, non-refundable payment of $56.0 million for the rights granted under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement. If Gilead exercises its option to an additional Program, we will receive an initiation fee of $28.0 million. If Gilead exercises its license option for all Programs, we will receive up to a total of approximately $1.5 billion across all three programs. We are further eligible to receive, with respect to all products arising from a Program, if approved, and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties based on the level of worldwide aggregate annual net sales at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits until the royalty term expires, subject to customary reductions. We also have an option to forego unachieved development milestones and royalties to enter into a 50/50 split of net profits and net losses arrangement for the third program upon a specified time period triggered by the first investigational new drug application filing for the third Program. In connection with entering into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to the Gilead Subscription Agreement, Gilead purchased 452,527 common shares of the Company at a price per share of $55.2454 for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $25.0 million. Gilead agreed not to transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of such shares for a period of time following the purchase of the shares, subject to certain customary exceptions.

On May 29, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “2024 Underwriting Agreement”) with Jefferies, BofA Securities, Inc., Leerink Partners LLC, Guggenheim Securities, LLC and BMO Capital Markets Corp., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “2024 Underwriters”), in connection with the issuance and sale by us in a public offering of 7,550,000 common shares of the Company, nominal value €0.09 per share, at a public offering price of $53.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions, pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and accompanying prospectus (Registration No. 333-277465), which became effective upon filing on February 28, 2024, and a prospectus supplement thereunder. Under the terms of the 2024 Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the 2024 Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,132,500 common shares at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On May 30, 2024, the 2024 Underwriters exercised this option in full. The offering closed on May 31, 2024, and we received net proceeds of $434.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

106

In addition to our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, we may receive research and development co-funding and are eligible to earn a significant amount of milestone payments under our collaboration agreements. Our ability to earn these payments and the timing of earning these payments is dependent upon the outcome of our research and development activities and is uncertain at this time. Our collaboration and license agreements may require payment of milestones to third parties contingent on future events.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings, collaboration arrangements, licensing, other business development opportunities and government grants. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to make license, milestone or royalty payments under our agreements with them, and government grants, we do not have any committed external sources of liquidity.

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our shareholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements, licensing or other business development opportunities in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or intellectual property, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

If we are unable to raise any additional funds that may be needed through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product candidate development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Our primary uses of capital are: clinical trial costs, third-party research and development services, personnel, laboratory and related supplies, legal, intellectual property and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. Because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. In addition, our expenditures as reported in our financial statements may be expected to be variable due to that uncertainty. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical and pre-clinical research studies, external manufacturers for product candidates for use in our clinical trials, and other research supplies and other services as part of our operations. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and are not contractual obligations. Our material contractual obligations, if any, are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Notes 9 and 10 of the attached Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on our current operating plan, research and development plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, particularly as the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $43.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of increases in cash outflows related to operating expenses of $102.3 million, partially offset by increases in cash inflows from collaboration arrangements (upfront payments, milestones, and research and development reimbursements) of $50.3 million, and cash inflows from Other Income of $8.4 million.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $193.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in purchases of marketable securities of $174.9 million, decreases in proceeds

107

from maturities of marketable securities of $20.4 million, and increases in purchases of intangible assets of $0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in purchases of property and equipment of $2.3 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $263.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher proceeds received from issuance of common stock in 2024 from the 2024 Underwriting Agreement of $434.9 million compared to the aggregate proceeds received in 2023 from the 2021 Sales Agreement with Jefferies of $63.8 million and the 2023 Underwriting Agreement of $162.2 million, an increase in proceeds received from the Gilead collaboration agreement of $22.6 million and an increase in proceeds from share option exercises of $32.3 million.

Cash Management

Our objective in managing our cash resources (cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities) is to safeguard Merus’ ability to continue as a going concern and to minimize the cost of capital to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.

Once we receive a source of financing, our cash resources are invested to preserve capital as a primary goal, and to derive some return as a secondary consideration. Cash and cash equivalents include deposits and investments held with financial institutions with an original maturity date of less than three months. Marketable securities include commercial paper, securities issued by several public corporations and the U.S. Treasury with a maturity date of greater than three months at the date of settlement. Cash and cash equivalents are held at banks and financial institutions with credit ratings varying between A and AAA, while investments are in highly rated vehicles with similar credit ratings.

Our invested cash resources are deployed to achieve our operating objectives in furthering our programs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments on material matters.

Revenue Recognition

Significant judgment is required in applying our accounting policies concerning revenue recognition. Our collaboration arrangements may be subject to the scope of many accounting standards in addition to the standards applicable to revenue from contracts with customers, including whether all or part of the arrangement may be a collaboration arrangement as defined in the accounting standards or whether financial instruments exchanged in the same arrangement may be subject to other guidance. Such matters may impact the initial recognition, subsequent accounting and disclosures concerning the arrangement.

Our collaboration arrangements typically include a license to our intellectual property and significant judgment is applied at the outset of the arrangement in determining whether the particular license is distinct from other performance obligations in the arrangement. We consider whether the counterparty may be able to utilize the license in the absence of the provision of other performance obligations by us. Each collaboration features unique terms to a license and the provision of other performance obligations also varies. Such considerations impact the timing of recognition of consideration allocated to performance obligations.

A key judgment in the application of our revenue recognition policy concerns the method of recognition of revenue over time as performance obligations are completed. Methods may include an input-based, output-based or other rational allocation method. Furthermore, estimates of progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations are often derived from expectations on the outcome of research and development activities which are subject to uncertainty.

Changes in these estimates of progress impact the timing of revenue recognition. These estimates have not materially changed in the current period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, with respect to the license and related activities performance obligation of the Incyte collaboration arrangement recognized as revenue over time as access to the platform for the generation of potential product candidates is provided to the customer, an increase of one year in the estimate as of January 1, 2024 would have decreased revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $5.8 million, excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation.

Other Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates

108

Going Concern	

Our evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern requires us to evaluate our future sources and uses of cash sufficient to fund our currently expected operations in conducting research and development activities one year from the date our financial statements are issued. We evaluate the probability associated with each source and use of cash resources in making our going concern determination. The research and development of pharmaceutical products is inherently subject to uncertainty.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of pending and recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qua
litative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflation. All of these market risks arise in the ordinary course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides additional information regarding these risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Our investments in marketable securities, which consist of corporate paper and notes, U.S. government securities and treasury notes, are subject to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2024, marketable securities were $430.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, marketable securities were $207.4 million. Due to the conservative and short-term nature of these investments in our portfolio, an immediate 10% change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our investment portfolio or on our financial position or results of operations for either year. We had no outstanding debt that is subject to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk

Merus US, Inc.’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of Merus N.V. is the euro. Our revenues and monetary assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our operating costs are in the Netherlands, which are denominated in the euro. This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Furthermore, we anticipate that a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in the euro. A hypothetical 15% weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have increased our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, by approximately $35.0 million and increased our currency translation adjustment by approximately $36.9 million. A hypothetical 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have an equal and opposite effect on our financial statements. A hypothetical 15% weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have increased our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, by approximately $24.5 million and increased our currency translation adjustment by approximately $66.1 million. A hypothetical 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have an equal and opposite effect on our financial statements.

Impact of Inflation

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our historical results of operations and financial condition. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through raising funds or other corrective measures, and our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 9A. Controls a
nd Procedures

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officer, has evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG Accountants N.V., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part IV, Item 15.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Regi

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Merus N.V.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying

consolidated balance sheets of Merus N.V. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows, and shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-
2

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Identification of distinct performance obligations

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”). The fixed consideration of $58.4 million was allocated equally between the Program #1 and Program #2 License and Research performance obligations, respectively.

We identified the evaluation of the distinct performance obligations identified by the Company as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the terms and conditions in the collaboration, option and license agreement with Gilead to assess the identification of distinct performance obligations.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including the identification of distinct performance obligations; and

- We obtained and read the collaboration, option and license agreement with Gilead and evaluated the terms and conditions to assess that the performance obligations within the agreement were identified in accordance with relevant accounting guidance.

/s/ KPMG Accountants N.V.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.

MERUS N.V.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The Company

Merus N.V. is an oncology company developing innovative antibody therapeutics, headquartered in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Merus US, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merus N.V. located at 139 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (collectively, the “Company”).
Since inception, the Company has generated an accumulated deficit of 
$
968.4
 million
 as of December 31, 2024. The Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as its antibody candidates advance through discovery, pre-clinical development and clinical trials and as it seeks regulatory approval and pursues commercialization of any approved antibody candidate.
As a result, the Company may need additional financing to support its continuing operations. Until the Company can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, the Company expects to finance its operations through public equity offerings, debt financings, or other sources, which may include collaborations, business development and licensing opportunities with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company’s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and may never do so.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Preparation
The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").

Principles of Consolidation

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company, consisting of Merus N.V.’s wholly owned subsidiary Merus US, Inc. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Functional and Presentation Currency
Items recorded in each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). Merus US, Inc.’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of Merus N.V. is the euro. After measuring foreign currency denominated transactions into an entity’s functional currency, to the extent that a subsidiary’s functional currency differs from its parent, a subsidiary’s financial position and results of operations are translated into its parent’s functional currency. The Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations are translated into the U.S. dollar as the Company’s reporting currency.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of collaboration revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company attempts to minimize the risks related to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by working with highly rated financial institutions that invest in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments as defined by the Company. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. The Company maintains its funds in accordance with its investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and is designed to limit the Company’s credit exposure to any single issuer.

F-
8

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from collaboration partners. The Company monitors economic conditions to identify facts or circumstances that may indicate that any of its accounts receivable are at risk of collection.

Subsequent Events

The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The Company evaluated all events and transactions through the date these financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:
•
Level 1 – Quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
•
Level 2 – Quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Fair value determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.
•
Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities that cannot be corroborated by market data. Fair value is determined by the reporting entity’s own assumptions utilizing the best information available and includes situations where there is little market activity for the asset or liability. 
The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company considers its cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities due with maturities 12 months or less, and accounts payable financial instruments to reflect their fair value given their short maturity and risk profile of the counterparty.
Going Concern

At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists and it is not alleviated by the Company’s plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s evaluation entails analyzing prospective operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of the Company’s cash needs, and comparing those needs to the current cash, cash equivalent and marketable security balances. After considering the Company’s current research and development plans and the timing expectations related to the progress of its clinical-stage programs and its plans to pursue commercialization of any antibody candidate, if approved, and after considering its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024
, the Company did not identify conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date these financial statements were issued.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt securities with original final maturities of 
three months or less
 from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Instruments subject to restrictions are not included in cash and cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
The Company maintains certain cash balances restricted to withdrawal or use. Restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for certain contractual agreements and is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

F-
9

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies marketable securities that are debt securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as held-to-maturity as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold such debt securities through maturity.

Debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these debt securities is included in interest income. Marketable securities are classified as current if their expected maturity is within one year or less of the balance sheet date and non-current if their maturity is beyond one year of the balance sheet date.
Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from collaboration partners as a result of research and development services provided or milestones achieved but not yet paid.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company evaluates its cash equivalents, accounts receivable and held-to-maturity marketable securities financial assets for expected credit losses. Expected credit losses represent the portion of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset that an entity does not expect to collect. An allowance for expected credit losses is meant to reflect a risk of loss even if remote, irrespective of the expectation of collection from a particular issuer or debt security. The Company has not historically experienced any credit losses on any of its financial assets.
With respect to cash equivalents and accounts receivable, given consideration of their short maturity, lack of historical losses and the current environment, the Company concluded there is generally no expected credit losses for these financial assets. With respect to held-to-maturity marketable securities which are comprised of debt securities, the Company evaluates expected credit losses on a pooled basis based on issuer-type which have similar credit risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses is immaterial for all periods presented.
Property and Equipment

The Company records property and equipment at cost. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Asset Category

Useful Lives

Laboratory equipment

5
 years

Office furniture and equipment

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of term of lease or 10 years

The Company capitalizes expenditures for new property and equipment and improvements to existing facilities and charges the cost of maintenance to expense. The Company eliminates the cost of property retired or otherwise disposed of, along with the corresponding accumulated depreciation or amortization, from the related accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events (for example, purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other assets) are expected. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be definite-lived and amortized over the useful economic life. The Company’s intangible assets are comprised of purchased licenses to intellectual property and software licenses.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used, including property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable.

Evaluation of recoverability is first based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. 
No
 such impairments were recorded in 
2024, 2023 or 2022
.

F-
10

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the Company does not recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability. The Company does not have any finance leases.
Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, and excludes non-lease payments. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Operating lease right-of-use assets also include the effect of any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has real estate operating lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately as operating lease costs and variable lease costs. Non-lease components in real estate leases refer to services provided by the lessor related to the premises. Fixed and variable lease payments are both allocated to lease and non-lease components. The allocation is determined on a relative fair value basis of the services provided relative to the operating lease of premises. With respect to equipment leases, the Company has elected not to allocate payments amongst lease and non-lease components as a practical expedient as afforded under ASC 842, 
Leases
.
Income Taxes

Deferred Taxes
The Company records deferred taxes to recognize the future effects of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities. The Company measures the deferred taxes using enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences are realized and records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available, reversing taxable temporary differences and other relevant factors. The Company records changes in the required valuation allowance in the period that the determination is made.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the technical merits, facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company records interest and penalties related to an underpayment of income taxes, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for an arrangement, the Company performs the following five step analysis:

i.
identify the contract(s) with a customer; 
ii.
identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
iii.
determine the transaction price; 
iv.
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
v.
recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
The Company has entered into collaboration and license agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to product candidates or future product candidates directed to specific targets (referred to as “exclusive licenses”) and (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed targets.

F-
11

As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use judgment to determine:

a)
the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; 
b)
the transaction price under step (iii) above; 
c)
the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above;
d)
whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time in step (v) above; and 
e)
the appropriate method for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation in step (v) above.
The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for sales-based royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. The Company recognizes variable consideration when the constraint has been resolved. Based on the nature of the variable consideration related to milestones, the Company allocates the variable amount (and subsequent changes to that amount) entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms a part of a single performance obligation. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.
Amounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as unbilled receivables.
Exclusive Licenses
If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.

In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the rights and obligations set out in the contract, the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises.

For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue.

The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.
The Company’s arrangements may provide the collaboration partner with the right to select a target for licensing either at the inception of the arrangement or in the future. Under these arrangements, fees may be due to the Company (i) at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment, (ii) upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license or (iii) upon extending the selection period as an extension fee or payment. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.

F-
12

For arrangements that include sales-based milestones and royalties, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any sales-based milestones or royalty revenue resulting from any of its arrangements.
Research and Development Services
The promises under the Company’s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under 
Exclusive Licenses 
above.

Reimbursements from the partner are evaluated as to whether the Company acts as a principal or an agent in such relationships. The Company evaluates whether control over the underlying goods or services were obtained prior to transferring these goods or services to the collaboration partner. Where the Company does not control the goods or services prior to transferring these goods or services to the collaboration partner, such reimbursements are presented net of costs.
At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments in respect of development efforts, the Company evaluates whether the development milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated development milestone value is included in the transaction price. Development milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular development milestone in making this assessment. There is judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.

At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of all development milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.
Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in providing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, contract research and development services, and other outside costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.

When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its product candidates incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history in conducting similar activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, among other considerations.

The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of research and development expenses.

The WBSO (
afdrachtvermindering speur- en ontwikkelingswerk
) is a Dutch fiscal facility that provides subsidies to companies, knowledge centers and self-employed people who perform research and development activities (as defined in the WBSO Act). Under this act, a contribution is paid towards the labor costs of employees directly involved in research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized 
$
12.8
 million
, $
5.9
 million and $
9.3
 million as a reduction of research and development expenses, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures employee share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the share-based compensation award. The Company grants share options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company’s common share on the date of grant, based on observable market prices.

For share-based awards subject time-based vesting, the Company recognizes employee share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, generally from the date of grant through each vesting date. The Company recognizes forfeitures at the time they occur. The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only represent those options that vest; the effect of forfeitures in the recognition of periodic compensation expense are not estimated prior to their occurrence.

Earnings (Loss) per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss is computed by adjusting net loss based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period, including potentially dilutive ordinary shares. For the purpose of this calculation, outstanding share options and unvested restricted share units are considered potential dilutive ordinary shares. Since the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, the basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods as the inclusion of all potential ordinary share equivalents outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.

The following securities, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, are considered to be ordinary share equivalents, but were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per ordinary share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive:

Segment Information

The Company operates in 
one
 reportable segment, which comprises the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is Bill Lundberg, CEO. The CODM measures the performance of the segment based on expenses by segment and earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to the segment.
The Company does not consider the impact of certain non-cash operating expenses such as share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and depreciation of property, plant, and equipment when evaluating the segment. Total assets by segment are not presented as that information is not used to allocate resources or assess performance at the segment level and is not reviewed by the CODM.
The reconciliation of segment operating results to Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the twelve months ended December 31,

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard‑setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is effective for the Company for the annual period ending December 31, 2024. The Company adopted and applied the amendments of this ASU to its disclosures.

The Company reviewed the other accounting standards that became effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2024, noting they do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

In 2020 and 2021, Dutch tax authorities enacted new tax rates applicable to future periods which impact the measurement of deferred income taxes. The effect of the change in the valuation allowance each year reflects the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets attributable to the Netherlands.

After consideration of all positive and negative evidence, the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that our Netherlands deferred tax assets that are not supported by reversing temporary differences will not be realized. As a result, the Company established a valuation allowance of 
$
215.4
 million
 and 
$
173.2
 million
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance of 
$
42.3
 million
 and 
$
43.3
 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is primarily attributable to the increase in net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance applies. As of December 31, 2024, the portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits would be credited directly to contributed capital totaled 
$
11.4
 million
.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any net operating losses for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes. The Company had net operating loss carryforwards for Dutch income tax purposes of 
$
764.9
 million
 as of December 31, 2024
. Under Dutch tax law, net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income in full up to €
1.0
 million and 
50
% of taxable income that exceeds €
1.0
 million. Effective as of January 1, 2022, these losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 
2024
, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to underpayments of income taxes and 
no
 amounts have been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will recognize interest and penalties related to an underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and Massachusetts jurisdictions as well as in the Netherlands. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Massachusetts tax authorities is closed for tax years prior to 2021. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Netherlands tax authorities is closed for tax years prior to 2019
. The Company is not currently under examination by the IRS or any other jurisdictions for any tax years.

9. Operating Leases

The Company has noncancelable operating leases for offices and lab spaces expiring at various dates through 2032.

Merus N.V. has non-cancellable operating leases for its corporate headquarters in Utrecht, the Netherlands. In December 2022, the Company moved into its new headquarters called the "Accelerator" in the Utrecht Science Park, at 17 Uppsalalaan, 3rd and 4th floor, 3583 CT, Utrecht.

On July 19, 2019, Merus N.V. entered into a lease agreement with Kadans Science Partner XIII B.V. (“Kadans”) for the Accelerator headquarters. In April 2022, the Accelerator lease between the Company and Kadans commenced. In accordance with the accounting requirements under ASC 842, the right-of-use asset and lease obligation were not recorded until the lease commenced. In December 2022, the Company completed the fit-out construction on approximately 
4,957
 square 
meters of office and laboratory space in the

F-
20

premises. 
The lease provides for a base rent of approximately €
1.4
 million per annum. 
The rent amount is subject to adjustment based on the consumer price index (the “CPI”) annually, beginning one year after the lease commencement date, subject to certain limitations if the CPI is greater than 
3.0
%.
 The initial term of the lease is 
ten years
 with 
two

5-year
 renewal options following the initial term, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Kadans, except that the earliest Kadans may terminate the lease is 
20
 years from the completion date of the premise construction. The Compan
y expects the lease to end as of 
April 4, 2032
. On April 5, 2022, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset of $
11.5
 million, or €
10.5
 million, and a lease liability of $
12.4
 million, or €
11.3
 million, on the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with signing the lease, the Company received a lease incentive of $
0.9
 million, or €
0.8
 million. To measure the lease liability at the commencement date, the Company discounted the outstanding lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate of 
4.85
%. 
On April 5, 2024, in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement, the annual rent for the Accelerator lease increased due to increases in the consumer price index (CPI). The portion of the rent payments related to the CPI index are included within variable lease costs. There have been no other changes in the Company’s lease arrangements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.
In March 2019, 
Merus US, Inc. entered into a non-cancellable 
operating lease
 agreement for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lease commenced in the second quarter of 2019 and has a term of 
seven years
, and 
may be extended for another 
five years
.
 Given the Company’s current plans, the renewal term has not been included in the estimate of the lease term.
 Fixed lease payments increase annually and include an increase on an inflationary measure. Variable payments include amounts due to the lessor for additional services and cost reimbursements.

10. Commitments and Contingencies

Indemnities

F-
21

The Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is unlimited; however, the Company has directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that is intended to limit its exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

The Company enters into certain agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business that contain indemnification provisions. These typically include agreements with directors and officers, business partners, contractors, landlords, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions, the Company may indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities, such as gross negligence, willful misconduct or at times, other activities. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may be unlimited. However, to date the Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal. Accordingly, the Company did not have any liabilities recorded for these obligations as of December 31, 2024.
Litigation

From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to or arising out of the Company’s operations. The Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
On August 5, 2024, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court of Delaware against Xencor, Inc. ("Xencor") alleging Xencor is infringing the Company's U.S. Patent Numbers (Nos.) 9,944,965 and 9,358,268, and 11,926,859, related to Xencor's manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale, and/or importation of certain antibodies and antibody technologies and methods in and/or into the United States. The Company is the plaintiff and Xencor is the defendant. As a result of Xencor’s acts, the Company has alleged that the Company has suffered and continues to suffer damages, is entitled to recover from Xencor damages sustained as a result of Xencor's wrongful and infringing acts, and the Company has and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm for which there is no remedy at law. Accordingly, the Company seeks, among other things, damages, equitable remedies, and an award of attorneys' fees. On October 10, 2024, Xencor filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which Merus responded to via an answering brief in opposition on October 31, 2024, and to which Xencor replied on November 14, 2024, with further submissions by the parties and proceedings to follow.

On February 11, 2025, Xencor filed two petitions for inter partes review before the Patent Technical Appeal Board of U.S. Patent Nos.  9,358,268 and 11,926,859, challenging such patents as allegedly invalid as anticipated and obvious in view of certain alleged prior art. The Company may file a preliminary response to the petition within three months of the date of the petition
.

On August 19, 2022, Kymab Limited ("Kymab"), a subsidiary of Sanofi, filed a notice of opposition against the Company's EP3456190 patent (the "'190 patent"), entitled "Antibody Producing Transgenic Murine Animal," in the European Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (the "EPO"). The notice asserted, as applicable, the '190 patent is contrary to the provision of Article 123(2) EPC, Article 75(1) EPC and Article 100(c) EPC, and alleges the '190 patent lacks novelty and/or is obvious contrary to the provisions of Articles 54 and/or 56 EPC, and Article 100(a) EPC, and that the specification of the '190 patent does not provide sufficient disclosure of the subject matter of the inventions contravening Article 83 EPC and Article 100(b).  On January 17, 2023, the Company timely filed a response before the European Opposition Division of the EPO contesting each of these assertions, with further oral proceedings scheduled to follow on January 18, 2024. On June 2, 2023, the European Opposition Division issued a non-binding preliminary decision. On January 18, 2024, the European Opposition Division held oral proceedings addressing each allegation of invalidity raised by Kymab and maintained the '190 patent as granted, and issued a written decision documenting these conclusions on February 16, 2024.  In April 2024, Kymab filed a notice of appeal before the Technical Board of Appeals, and Grounds of Appeal on June 17, 2024. The Company filed a response to Kymab's notice of appeal on October 18, 2024, with further submissions by the parties and proceedings to follow. The Company does not expect significant impact on its assets or liabilities as a result of the opposition proceeding.

12. Collaborations

Gilead
On March 5, 2024, the Company entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement (the “Gilead Collaboration Agreement”) and Share Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”). Gilead agreed to pay the Company a $
56.0
 million, non-refundable upfront payment, and purchased 
452,527
 common shares at a stated price per share of $
55.2454
 for an aggregate purchase price of $
25.0
 million. Merus is also eligible to receive license option exercise payments, potential development and commercialization milestones, tiered royalties on product sales should Gilead successfully commercialize a therapy from the collaboration, and an initiation fee should Gilead exercise its right to include a third Program in the collaboration. Under the terms of the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Gilead agreed to collaborate on the use of Merus’ proprietary Triclonics® platform to develop certain trispecific T-cell engaging multi-specific antibody products for the treatment of certain indications. The collaboration shall include at least two, but may include up to three, separate preclinical research programs (each, a “Program”) for the design and validation of candidates directed to the applicable Program targets selected by Gilead. On a Program-by-Program basis, the Company has granted Gilead an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license for such Program. If Gilead exercises the license option with respect to a Program, for the first two Programs, Gilead will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization of the products arising from such Program. Upon exercise of its option to include the third Program in the collaboration, Gilead will pay the Company a non-refundable upfront initiation fee of $
28.0
 million, and Merus shall have the option to share in the worldwide net profit or loss, including development costs and expenses for the third Program only.

The initial term of the arrangement is the shorter of the completion of all activities under the applicable research plan or forty-eight months following the initiation of research plan activities. If, as of the fourth anniversary of the initiation of activities under the applicable Program, Merus has not completed the activities under the then current mutually agreed research plans in accordance with the timelines set forth therein (other than due to the act or omission of Gilead), the applicable term shall automatically be extended by an additional twelve months (for a maximum term of sixty months), unless otherwise extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Gilead's obligations under the collaboration to pay milestones and royalties, continues until the longer of an expiration of certain royalty bearing patents or fixed period after a first commercial sale. The arrangement may be terminated in its entirety or in relation to one or more Programs for any reason at any time upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to Merus.

At inception of the arrangement, the Company identified two performance obligations for each of the initial two Programs. The first is the License and Research single performance obligation comprised of a combined delivery of a nonexclusive license and related activities, including research activities associated with the Program and the activities of the joint steering committee. The second is the twelve-month extension (material right) for the Program. Merus accounted for the Program-by-Program options to obtain exclusive licenses as a marketing offer because the exclusive license provides Gilead with additional clinical development and commercialization rights, and the license option exercise fee of $
10.0
 million on a Program-by-Program basis was estimated to be offered at the standalone selling price.  The option to include a third Program was accounted for as a marketing offer because the non-refundable upfront initiation fee of $
28.0
 million was estimated to be offered at the standalone selling price.
The transaction price at inception was comprised of fixed consideration of $
58.4
 million that was derived from the $
56.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment and $
25.0
 million common shares purchase proceeds, net of the fair value of the common shares delivered to Gilead of $
22.6
 million. All other consideration under the arrangement was determined to be variable consideration and fully constrained at inception.

The fixed consideration was allocated equally between the Program #1 and Program #2 License and Research performance obligations, respectively. The equal allocation of the fixed consideration was based on the estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation as each was materially the same.

The Company initially deferred $
58.4
 million allocated to the performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over time using an output method to measure progress towards completing the research activities dictated by each Program’s respective research plan. Development milestones, commercialization milestones and royalties are variable consideration, fully constrained, to be included in the transaction price for each performance obligation and recognized in future periods in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy. The revenue recognized relating to each combined performance obligation is presented in the notes according to the source of consideration received (upfront and milestone), reflective of their differing timing of receipt.
As of December 31, 2024
, research activities have commenced, but 
no
 milestones have been achieved. The Company received the $
56.0
 million upfront payment from Gilead in April 2024.

Partner Therapeutics
On November 27, 2024, the Company entered into a license agreement (the "Partner Therapeutics License Agreement") with Partner Therapeutics, Inc. ("PTx"). Under the terms of the Partner Therapeutics License Agreement, the Company granted to PTx (i) an

F-
24

exclusive, sublicenseable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights and know-how to (a) exploit zenocutuzumab for the treatment of NRG1+ cancer in the United States and (b) develop, manufacture and commercialize companion diagnostic tests with respect to zenocutuzumab for the treatment of NRG1+ cancer in the United States and (ii) a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights and know-how to commercialize zenocutuzumab for the treatment of NRG1+ cancer outside of the United States solely in connection with a named patient program until the Company files for any regulatory approval for zenocutuzumab in any country outside the United States. The Company retains all rights not granted to PTx. PTx granted to the Company an exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to certain intellectual property of PTx to exploit zenocutuzumab for (1) the treatment of NRG1+ cancer in a country outside of the United States and (2) for any other uses of zenocutuzumab in any other territory. If after three years after the launch of zenocutuzumab in the United States, PTx does not to achieve certain specified annual net sales targets, the Company and PTx will work in good faith to develop a plan to improve net sales. If in the subsequent year PTx does not achieve the specified annual net sales target, the Company has the right to terminate the PTx License Agreement, with all rights reverting to Company.
In exchange for the rights granted under the Partner Therapeutics License Agreement, PTx has agreed to pay an upfront, non-refundable payment, agreed to fund the development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses for zenocutuzumab and certain companion diagnostic products (other than a portion of the expenses associated with securing or maintaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration) and the Company is eligible to receive up to $
130.0
 million in commercialization milestone payments based on annual net sales of zenocutuzumab. The Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalties based on the level of aggregate annual net sales ranging from high single digits to low twenties until the royalty term expires. PTx also has the option to purchase existing quantities of zenocutuzumab from the Company at a specified cost-plus rate.

The initial term of the arrangement is the period from the first commercial sale until the latest of the following to occur: a) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering zenocutuzumab (b) the launch of a biosimilar; or (c) twelve (12) years after the date of the first commercial sale of zenocutuzumab. PTx holds termination for convenience rights and must give 9 months’ notice to exercise those rights and may only exercise those rights following the second anniversary of the first commercial sale of zenocutuzumab. The Company may terminate the Partner Therapeutics License Agreement if PTx fails to achieve a specified annual net sales target in the fourth calendar year after first commercial sale. The Company determined that, at the inception of the contract, there are enforceable rights and obligations throughout the term of the contract.  The term of the contract is estimated to be 
12
 years.
The transaction price at inception was comprised of fixed consideration of the immaterial upfront non-refundable payment. The upfront non-refundable consideration is not material to the contract or the Company as a whole.

As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 milestones have been achieved, no royalties have been earned, and no sales of existing zenocutuzumab have occurred.

Lilly
On January 18, 2021, Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) agreed to pay the Company a $
40.0
 million, non-refundable upfront payment, and purchased 
706,834
 common shares at a stated price per share of $
28.295
, for an aggregate purchase price of $
20.0
 million. The Company and Lilly agreed to collaborate with respect to the discovery and research of bispecific antibodies utilizing the Company’s proprietary Biclonics® bispecific technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to three (3) independent programs directed to the generation of T-cell re-directing bispecific antibodies that bind CD3 and a tumor associated antigen target selected by Lilly to be the subject of each program.

The objective of each program is to develop a lead compound that Lilly would be able to continue to develop through clinical trials. Lilly agreed to fund the research activities the Company conducts for each program under an agreed research plan and budget. Lilly receives an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights and know-how to exploit certain compounds and products directed to designated targets in combination with targeting CD3, or directed to such designated target(s) alone as a monospecific antibody or monospecific antibody drug conjugate, subject to rights granted by Merus to third parties under one or more existing third party agreements. Merus retains all rights not granted to Lilly. Lilly has certain rights to replace selected targets, including the right to substitute a target selection after initial selection for a period of time. The Company may be entitled to further milestones and royalties in the future dependent on development and commercialization of any resulting product.
The initial term of the arrangement includes a three-year research term for the Company to perform research and development activities, subject to two extension terms of six months at Lilly’s discretion. While the arrangement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis at will by Lilly, there are no direct costs or penalties to Lilly to terminate the arrangement prior to the end of the initial term.
At inception of the arrangement, the Company identified a single performance obligation comprised of a combined delivery of a license and related activities, including research activities associated with a product candidate against the first target and the activities of the joint steering committee. The Company also identified two other combined performance obligations relating to options exercisable by Lilly to select a second and third target to advance a second and third product candidate against the selected targets through discovery and research.

F-
25

The transaction price at inception was comprised of fixed consideration of $
43.5
 million that was derived from the $
40.0
 million upfront payment and $
20.0
 million share purchase proceeds, net of the fair value of shares of the shares delivered to Lilly of $
16.5
 million, and variable consideration associated with the funding of research services for the product candidate against the first target at inception. All other consideration under the arrangement was determined to be variable consideration and fully constrained at inception.

The fixed consideration was allocated equally amongst the three performance obligations and the variable consideration associated with each target was allocated to the performance obligation of each respective target.  The equal allocation of the fixed consideration was based on the estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation as each was materially the same.
On February 12, 2021, the Company and Lilly completed the initial exchange of fixed consideration and transfer of common shares. The Company initially deferred $
43.5
 million allocated to the performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over time using a cost-to-cost measure of progress toward the development of a lead compound for each respective target, anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the initial research term, along with research funding. Development milestones, commercialization milestones and royalties are variable consideration, fully constrained, to be included in the transaction price for each performance obligation and recognized in future periods in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy. The revenue recognized relating to each combined performance obligation is presented in the notes according to the source of consideration received (upfront, reimbursement revenue, milestone), reflective of their differing timing of receipt.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Lilly substituted one of the target programs. The program timeline is expected to extend beyond the original research term. Under the current research plan, for the program to be completed in collaboration with Merus, Lilly would be required to extend the research term to 2025, subject to its discretion. Lilly exercised the first six month extension in October 2023 for which there was no associated fee. The program timeline is expected to extend beyond this first extension, and such an extension into 2025 would result in a fee of $
0.5
 million. The $
0.5
 million extension is included in the Lilly cost-to-cost model as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2024
, research activities were on-going and 
no
 milestones have been achieved to date.
Incyte
In December 2016, pending regulatory clearance, Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) agreed to pay the Company a $
120.0
 million, non-refundable upfront payment, and purchased 
3.2
 million common shares at a stated price per share of $
25.00
, for an aggregate purchase price of $
80.0
 million. In exchange, the Company granted Incyte with a license to certain of its intellectual property and committed to collaborate with Incyte to research, discover and develop monospecific or bispecific antibodies utilizing the Company’s proprietary bispecific technology platform. The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee in which both parties are represented and is tasked with overseeing the activities which significantly contributes to the collaboration. The collaboration may encompass up to nine product candidates that result from the Company’s application of its proprietary Biclonics
®
 technology platform. During the course of the initial research term, Merus proposes product candidates to Incyte, which evaluates whether to designate proposed product candidates from the Company to make a selection for further research. Proposed product candidates begin at a pre-clinical stage of development. Incyte has certain rights to replace product candidates, including the right to substitute a product candidate after initial selection. The Company would be entitled to future consideration in the form of cost reimbursements for research services, development milestones, commercialization milestones and royalties related to the programs under the arrangement.
At inception of the collaboration, two potential bispecific product candidates were under preliminary evaluation. After further research, a lead candidate was ultimately selected for the first product candidate, designated MCLA-145, and the other potential product candidate was not pursued. For the designated product candidate (MCLA-145), the Company retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize products and product candidates in the United States, while Incyte obtained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize products and product candidates arising from such program outside the United States. For MCLA-145, the parties agreed to conduct and share equally the costs of mutually agreed global development activities and to be solely responsible for independent development activities in each party’s respective territories. For all other programs under the arrangement to be selected by Incyte, Incyte will be responsible for all research, development and commercialization costs. The Company may elect to co-fund the development of certain of the other programs in the future, in which case costs and benefits would be shared. The Company has not elected to co-fund any programs to date.
At inception of the arrangement, the Company identified a performance obligation comprised of a combined delivery of a license and related activities, including the activities of the joint steering committee, to which to allocate consideration. The arrangement also allowed for optional future research services to advance selected product candidates through discovery and research. The transaction price was comprised of fixed consideration of an upfront payment of $
120.0
 million and proceeds from the sale of shares of $
80.0
 million. All other consideration under the arrangement was determined to be variable consideration and fully constrained at inception. $
152.6
 million of the transaction price was allocated to the license and related activities performance obligation after accounting for the purchase of common shares by Incyte.
On January 23, 2017, the Company completed the sale of shares and exchange of the license. The Company initially deferred $
152.6
 million 
of the transaction price allocated to the license and related performance obligation as deferred revenue, to be recognized as

F-
26

revenue 
over time as the primary benefit of the license to Incyte is access to the Company’s intellectual property covering its Biclonics® technology platform for the generation of potential product candidates. Development milestones, commercialization milestones and royalties are variable consideration, fully constrained, to be recognized in future periods in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Cost reimbursements for research services are recognized as they are performed over time as these are considered a separate performance obligation.
In January 2022, the Company announced that Incyte elected to opt-out of its ex-U.S. development of MCLA-145, from the parties joint collaboration agreement executed in 2017. At inception of the collaboration, for the designated product candidate (MCLA-145), the Company retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize products and product candidates in the United States, while Incyte obtained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize products and product candidates arising from such program outside the United States. For MCLA-145, the parties conducted and shared equally the costs of mutually agreed global development activities. Incyte’s opt-out of ex-U.S. rights to MCLA-145 provides the Company the exclusive right to develop and commercialize potential MCLA-145 products globally. Under the collaboration, Incyte continued to support the program for a limited time while ex-U.S. activities were transitioned to the Company, and Incyte will retain a right to a residual royalty of up to 
4
% on sales of future commercialization of MCLA-145, if approved. The Company has ceased clinical development of MCLA-145, and is seeking a collaboration to continue its potential development.
During the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company recognized a $
1.0
 million milestone from Incyte related to candidate nomination. There were 
no
 additional development or commercialization milestones recognized during the year ended 
December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023
, the Company recognized a total of $
6.0
 million in development milestones. During the year ended 
December 31, 2022
, the Company recognized a total of $
1.0
 million in development milestones.
Ono
In April 2014, the Company granted Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Ono”) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, research, test, make, use and market a limited number of bispecific antibody candidates based on the Company’s Biclonics
®
 technology platform against two undisclosed targets directed to a particular undisclosed target combination.

On March 14, 2018, the Company granted Ono an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, research, test, make, use and market a limited number of bispecific antibody candidates based on the Company’s Biclonics
®
 technology platform against two undisclosed targets directed to a particular undisclosed target combination. Ono is responsible for identifying lead candidates and conducting further non-clinical and clinical development activities for such licensed bispecific antibodies and pharmaceutical products containing such antibodies, including manufacture and process development. Additionally, Ono controls and has exclusive rights over the worldwide commercialization of any approved products, including worldwide supply, and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to commercialization. Ono has also agreed to fund the Company’s research and development activities and be responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses for its own research and development activities, which are set out in a mutually agreed upon research plan. The Company retains all rights to use and commercialize any antibodies that are generated under the collaborative research program, excluding the up to 
five
 lead and/or selected antibodies against the targets Ono is pursuing, provided that the use and commercialization is not with respect to the particular target combination. Ono agreed to pay the Company an upfront, non-refundable payment of €
0.7
 million. In addition, the Company was entitled to €
0.3
 million intended to compensate the Company for research services already completed upon entering into the agreement, and €
0.2
 million to be paid to the Company over time for full time equivalent funding. The Company is entitled to research and development milestones in addition to royalties on future sales. The Company identified performance obligations for: (1) provision of a license for the target combination, and (2) research and development services. The Company concluded that Ono would be able to develop and benefit from the license, independent of the research and development services. The research and development services are capable of being performed by third parties with an appropriate sub-license, and are recognized over time as these services are delivered. Milestone payments are fully constrained as variable consideration to be recognized in future periods in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy.
During the year ended December 31, 2024 
the Company achieved a $
2.0
 million development milestone from Ono for the filing of an Investigational Drug Application, or equivalent, for an asset arising under this agreement. 
There were 
no
 development milestones achieved in the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company achieved a €
1.0
 million (approximately $
1.0
 million) development milestone in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Betta
On December 10, 2018, the Company granted Betta an exclusive license to develop and commercialize in China MCLA-129, proprietary Biclonics® produced by its Biclonics® technology platform. The Company retains all rights outside of China. Betta has agreed to retain a contract manufacturing organization with experience in filing IND applications with U.S. regulatory authorities and CTAs with European regulatory authorities in order to produce clinical trial materials for the Chinese market and rest of the world. As a key strategic component of the collaboration, Betta will be responsible for IND enabling studies and manufacturing of clinical trial

F-
27

materials in China, which the Company intends to use to assist regulatory filing and early stage clinical development in the rest of the world.
In addition to a non-refundable upfront payment of $
1.0
 million, Betta and the Company will share equally the cost of the transfer of the manufacturing technology to a contract manufacturing organization. The Company is also eligible to receive an aggregate of $
12.0
 million in milestone payments contingent upon Betta achieving certain specified development and commercial goals as well as tiered royalty payments of net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in China. In turn, Betta is also entitled to milestone payments based on the Company’s progress.
The Company identified a single combined performance obligation, being the delivery of the MCLA-129 license including activities necessary to complete the technology transfer. The Company had no other commitments. The transaction price is comprised of fixed consideration of $
1.0
 million and fully allocated to the single performance obligation which would be fulfilled at a point in time. The technology transfer to deliver the license was completed in 2018 and Company recognized the revenue related to this performance obligation of $
1.0
 million as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Development milestone payments allocated to the performance obligation are constrained as variable consideration to be recognized in future periods in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy.
To date, both
 the Company and Betta have achieved a development milestone both valued at $
2.0
 million. The amounts were recognized as mileston
e revenue of $
2.0
 million and research and development cost of $
2.0
 million in the Company’s statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.

13. Employee Benefit Plans

Share-Based Compensation
2016 Plan
In 2016, the Company established the 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the “2016 Plan”). All incentive award grants since 2016 are being made under the 2016 Plan. At the Company’s annual general meeting of shareholders held on May 7, 2024, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment and restatement of the 2016 Plan that extended the term of the 2016 Plan to December 31, 2031 and extended the annual “evergreen” feature from and including January 1, 2026 to January 1, 2029.
Options granted to employees under the 2016 Plan generally vest in installments over a 
four-year
 period from the grant date: 
25
% vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and the remaining 
75
% of the options vest in 
36
 monthly installments for each full month of continuous service provided thereafter. Options expire after 
10
 years from the date of grant.

Options granted to non-executive directors consist of initial option grants as well as subsequent annual awards. The initial award of options granted vest in installments over a 
three-year
 period: 
33
% of the options vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and 
67
% of the options vest in 
24
 monthly installments thereafter. Each subsequent award vests over a 
one-year
 period in 
12
 monthly installments. The Company measures the fair value of an option through the application of an option pricing model, as more fully described below.
The RSUs granted to employees under the 2016 Plan vest in installments over a 
four-year
 period from the grant date. 
Each RSU represents the right to receive one common share.
 The fair value of an RSU is determined by reference to the price of the underlying common share.
The number of common shares authorized for issuance for future grants under the 2016 Plan as of January 1, 2025 totaled 
2,826,050
.

Share-Based Compensation Expense
Share-based compensation expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows:

As of December 31, 2024, share-based compensation expense related to unvested shares was 
$
48.1
 million
. These shares are expected to vest and related costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 
1.3
 years.
Share Option Valuation
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of share option awards. Key weighted average assumptions used in this pricing model on the date of grant for options granted to employees are as follows:

The 
risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, with a term that approximates the expected life of the option. Prior to April 1, 2022, the Company determined the expected volatility using a blended approach encompassing its historical experience and the historical volatility of a peer group of comparable publicly traded companies with product candidates in similar stages of development to the Company’s product candidates. From April 1, 2022 onward, the expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of the Company's share price for a time period consistent with the expected term of each grant. A simplified method using a weighted-average mid-point between an award’s vesting date and expiry is used to estimate the expected life of options in all periods presented as a sufficient history of participant exercise behavior is not

F-
30

readily 
observable. The Company has applied an expected dividend yield of 
0.0
% as the Company has not historically declared a dividend and does not anticipate declaring a dividend during the expected life of the options.

Contingent Share Option Awards
On February 1, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the grant of share options to purchase an aggregate of 
2,446,045
 common shares, at an exercise price of $
36.09
 per share, to employees as the annual grant for 2024. These share option grants were approved subject to the Company’s shareholders approving an amendment to the Company’s articles of association to increase the authorized share capital (the “Shareholder Approval Condition”), provided that such options would be forfeited if the Shareholder Approval Condition was not satisfied by January 1, 2025. On May 7, 2024, the shareholders approved the amendment to the Company’s articles of association, including the requisite increase in the authorized share capital satisfying the Shareholder Approval Condition. The grant-date fair value of these options is based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, using the fair market value of a common share on the date the Shareholder Approval Condition was satisfied. Share-based compensation expense for these options was recorded beginning in the second quarter of 2024.

Post-Employment Benefit Plan

The Company has established a post-employment benefit plan for employees of the Netherlands that entitles executive officers and other staff members to retire at the age of 67 and receive annual payments based upon the average salary earned during the service period. The Company has insured the benefit liabilities through purchased non-participating annuities from an insurance company and has no other obligation other than to pay the annual insurance premiums to the insurance company. After purchasing the insurance, the

F-
31

Company has no further obligation (legal or constructive) to pay further amounts if the insurance fund has insufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to current and prior service. Contributions to purchase non-participating annuities are expensed as incurred as service costs. Company contributions to the post-employment benefit plan totaled 
$
2.6
 million
, $
2.8
 million, and $
2.9
 million in the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
401(k) Savings Plan

The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”). 
The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all U.S. employees, and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pretax basis. The Company matches contributions to the 401(k) Plan, matching 
50
% of an employee’s contribution up to a maximum of 
3
% of the participant’s compensation.
 Company contributions to the 401(k) Plan totaled 
$
0.4

15. Subsequent Events
In January 2025, the Company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Biohaven Ltd ("Biohaven") to co-develop three novel bispecific antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), leveraging Merus’ Biclonics® technology platform, and Biohaven’s ADC conjugation and payload platform technologies.
Under the terms of the agreement, Biohaven is responsible for the preclinical ADC generation of three Merus bispecific antibodies under mutually agreed research plans. The agreement includes two Merus bispecific programs previously generated using the Biclonics® platform, and one program under preclinical research by Merus. Each program is subject to mutual agreement for advancement to further development, with the parties then sharing subsequent external development costs and commercialization, if advanced. Merus received an upfront payment of $
5.0
 million in the form of Biohaven shares pursuant to a private placement agreement, and is eligible to receive a license fee at ADC candidate nomination of the first program of $
5.0
 million, with Merus to assume the preclinical bispecific antibody generation cost of the third program, and Biohaven to assume the preclinical ADC generation cost for each of the three preclinical; programs. Thereafter, upon mutual agreement to advance each program, the parties plan to share further development and commercialization costs. The Company is in progressing of assessing the accounting implications of the Biohaven collaboration.
