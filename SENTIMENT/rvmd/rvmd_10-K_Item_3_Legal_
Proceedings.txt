Item 3. Legal 
Proceedings.

From time to time, we are and may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

On December 9, 2024, 
Nemeth v. Casdin, et al.
, Case No. 2024-1268-KSJM (Del. Ch.), was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Complaint) arising from CM Life Sciences III., Inc.’s (CMLS III) December 17, 2021 merger with EQRx., Inc. (Legacy EQRx) (the Merger). The Complaint was filed by former stockholders of CMLS III and brings claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against members of CMLS III’s board of directors, CMLS III’s officers, and CMLS III’s sponsor in connection with the Merger. The Complaint also brings claims for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against certain investment firms involved with the merger process, the Company, solely as successor-in-interest to EQRx, and Legacy EQRx’s former Executive Chairman and CEO, Alexis Borisy, who is also on our board of directors. Defendants’ response to the Complaint is due on February 28, 2025.

At this juncture, we do not believe this action will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. Although we believe a loss relating to the Complaint is reasonably possible, given the early stage of the case (i.e., before any motion to dismiss rulings or discovery), we cannot make an estimate regarding the range of loss. We intend to defend vigorously against the Complaint.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing novel targeted therapies for RAS-addicted cancers. We possess sophisticated structure-based drug discovery capabilities built upon deep chemical biology and cancer pharmacology know-how and innovative, proprietary technologies that enable the creation of small molecules tailored to unconventional binding sites. Guided by our understanding of genetic drivers and adaptive resistance mechanisms in cancer, we deploy precision medicine approaches to inform innovative monotherapy and combination regimens.

Our research and development pipeline comprises RAS(ON) inhibitors that bind directly to RAS variants, which we refer to as RAS(ON) Inhibitors, and RAS companion inhibitors that target key nodes in the RAS pathway or associated pathways. Our RAS(ON) Inhibitors are designed to be used as monotherapy, in combination with other RAS(ON) Inhibitors and/or in combination with RAS companion inhibitors or other therapeutic agents.

RAS(ON) Inhibitors

Our RAS(ON) Inhibitors are based on our proprietary tri-complex technology platform, which enables a highly differentiated approach to inhibiting the active, GTP-bound form of RAS, which we refer to as RAS(ON). We are developing a portfolio of compounds that we believe were the first RAS(ON) Inhibitors to use this mechanism of action. We believe that direct inhibitors of RAS(ON) suppress cell growth and survival and are less susceptible to adaptive resistance mechanisms recognized for RAS(OFF) inhibitors.

We are evaluating our RAS(ON) Inhibitors alone and in combination with other drugs and investigational drug candidates, particularly in-pathway agents. We believe tailored RAS(ON) Inhibitors will be useful to serve the diverse landscape of RAS-addicted cancers optimally. We believe that in some cases, patients may experience maximal clinical benefit from the broad activity of our RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor, daraxonrasib (RMC-6236), if approved. In others, we believe treatment with a RAS(ON) mutant-selective inhibitor may be optimal. We further believe that in some cases, it could be beneficial to combine daraxonrasib with a RAS(ON) mutant-selective inhibitor, with daraxonrasib functioning as the backbone of these RAS(ON) Inhibitor doublets. In addition, we believe that in some cases, combination of our RAS(ON) Inhibitors with standard of care therapies, including immunotherapies, may be optimal.

We are advancing a deep pipeline of RAS(ON) Inhibitors, including daraxonrasib (RMC-6236), our RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor; elironrasib (RMC-6291), our G12C-selective inhibitor; and zoldonrasib (RMC-9805), our G12D-selective inhibitor. Together, we consider these three clinical-stage candidates as the first wave of RAS(ON) inhibitors that we are advancing through clinical development. We also currently plan to advance RMC-5127 (G12V) into clinical development. In addition, we have other preclinical-stage RAS(ON) inhibitor clinical development opportunities, including the RAS(ON) mutant-selective inhibitors RMC-0708 (Q61H) and RMC-8839 (G13C).

Daraxonrasib (RMC-6236)

Daraxonrasib (RMC-6236), our RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor, is designed as an oral, RAS-selective tri-complex inhibitor of multiple RAS(ON) variants containing cancer driver mutations at all three of the major RAS mutation hotspot positions (G12, G13 and Q61). Daraxonrasib inhibits all three major RAS isoforms, suppressing the mutant cancer driver and cooperating wild-type RAS proteins.

A global, randomized Phase 3 registrational trial of daraxonrasib in the second-line (2L) treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which we call the RASolute 302 study, is ongoing. In the RASolute 302 study, we are randomizing patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daraxonrasib at a dose of 300 mg daily or the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. The RASolute 302 study has a nested trial design allowing for a hierarchical sequence of statistical analysis, with patients with tumors harboring RAS G12X mutations serving as the core population which will be tested first and all enrolled patients serving as the secondary population. We believe this nested design and hierarchical testing increases the probability of trial success based on the core population while creating an opportunity to gain approval for a broader population. Patients in the RASolute 302 study will be evaluated for the dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the core

89

population, with secondary endpoints including PFS and OS in the secondary population and objective response rate (ORR) and quality of life measures. We currently expect to substantially complete enrollment of the RASolute 302 study in 2025, to enable an expected clinical readout in 2026.

Having finalized the study protocol, we are now activating sites for a global, randomized Phase 3 registrational trial comparing daraxonrasib versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been treated with immunotherapy and platinum-containing chemotherapy, which we call the RASolve 301 study. In the RASolve 301 study, we are randomizing patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daraxonrasib or docetaxel. The RASolve 301 study has a nested trial design allowing for a hierarchical sequence of statistical analysis, with patients with tumors harboring RAS G12X (other than G12C) mutations serving as the core population which will be tested first, and all enrolled patients serving as the secondary population. We believe this nested design and hierarchical testing increases the probability of trial success based on the core population while creating an opportunity to gain approval for a broader population. Patients in the RASolve 301 study will be evaluated for the dual primary endpoints of PFS and OS in the core population, with secondary endpoints including PFS and OS in the secondary population and ORR and quality of life measures.

We currently expect to initiate a global, randomized Phase 3 daraxonrasib monotherapy study in patients with first-line (1L) metastatic PDAC in the second half of 2025. We also currently expect to initiate a global, randomized Phase 3 monotherapy study of daraxonrasib as adjuvant treatment for patients with resectable PDAC in the second half of 2025.

On December 2, 2024 we reported updated clinical safety, tolerability, and activity data for daraxonrasib from our first-in-human monotherapy study of daraxonrasib, which we refer to as the RMC-6236-001 study, in patients with previously treated RAS-mutant PDAC as of a data cutoff date of July 23, 2024. We believe these data showed that daraxonrasib was generally well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity that supported our initiation of the RASolute 302 study.

Also on December 2, 2024, we reported clinical safety and tolerability data as of a September 30, 2024 data cutoff date for daraxonrasib from the RMC-6236-001 study in patients with NSCLC with tumors harboring RAS mutations. We also reported clinical activity data as of a September 30, 2024 data cutoff date for daraxonrasib from the RMC-6236-001 study in patients with NSCLC with tumors harboring RAS G12X mutations who had received one or two prior lines of therapy which must have included prior immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy administered either concurrently or sequentially, but not docetaxel, a study population matching the planned RASolve 301 enrollees. We believe these data showed that daraxonrasib was generally well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity that supported our initiation of the RASolve 301 study.

Based on our observations from the RMC-6236-001 study and our preclinical observations, we believe there is a potential opportunity to evaluate daraxonrasib combinations in earlier lines of therapy in multiple tumor types, and we are currently evaluating several exploratory combination regimens that include daraxonrasib in order to assess the potential for development in these settings. These combinations include daraxonrasib with pembrolizumab, daraxonrasib with elironrasib, daraxonrasib with zoldonrasib and daraxonrasib with standard of care chemotherapy agents.

On December 2, 2024, we disclosed initial clinical safety and tolerability data  as of a data cutoff date of October 28, 2024 from our clinical study of the combination of daraxonrasib with pembrolizumab, which we believe showed the combination was generally well tolerated with limited hepatotoxicity.

Also on December 2, 2024, we disclosed initial clinical safety, tolerability and activity data as of a data cutoff date of October 28, 2024 from our clinical study of  the combination of daraxonrasib with elironrasib, which we believe showed the combination was generally well tolerated and provide initial proof-of-mechanism for a RAS(ON) inhibitor doublet in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who were previously treated with KRAS(OFF) G12C inhibitors. We believe these preliminary data observations support continued development of RAS(ON) inhibitor doublets in a broad range of tumor types and earlier lines of therapy, including 1L patients with NSCLC carrying RAS G12C tumors.

In April 2024, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, we reported individual case studies from the RMC-6236-001 study that showed examples of objective responses to daraxonrasib in patients with tumor types beyond PDAC or NSCLC, specifically patients with melanoma and with CRC.

Elironrasib (RMC-6291)

Elironrasib (RMC-6291) is designed as a RAS(ON) oral tri-complex G12C-selective inhibitor. It is designed to exhibit subnanomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of RAS G12C-bearing cancer cells and is engineered to be highly selective for RAS G12C over wild-type RAS and other cellular targets. Elironrasib is designed to be differentiated from

90

first-generation KRAS(OFF) G12C inhibitors, which sequester the KRAS(OFF) G12C form, by its mechanism of directly inhibiting the RAS(ON) G12C form.

On October 13, 2023, we reported interim preliminary safety and anti-tumor data from our ongoing first-in-human study of elironrasib, which we refer to as the RMC-6291-001 study, as of an October 5, 2023 data cut-off date, which we believe provide preliminary evidence of clinically meaningful differentiation of elironrasib from KRAS(OFF) G12C inhibitors.

We are evaluating several exploratory combination regimens that include elironrasib in order to assess the potential for development in earlier lines of therapy. These combinations include elironrasib with pembrolizumab and, as discussed in the “
Daraxonrasib (RMC-6236
)” section above, elironrasib with daraxonrasib. We are also planning a combination study of elironrasib with both daraxonrasib and pembrolizumab.

On December 2, 2024, we disclosed initial clinical safety, tolerability and activity data for the combination of daraxonrasib with elironrasib, as discussed in the “
Daraxonrasib (RMC-6236
)” section above.

Also on December 2, 2024, we disclosed clinical safety and tolerability data as of a data cutoff date of October 28, 2024 for the combination of elironrasib with pembrolizumab, which we believe showed the combination was generally well tolerated with limited hepatotoxicity.

Zoldonrasib (RMC-9805)

Zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) is designed as a RAS(ON) oral tri-complex G12D-selective inhibitor. It is designed to exhibit low nanomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of RAS G12D-bearing cancer cells and is engineered to covalently inactivate RAS G12D irreversibly.

On October 25, 2024, we reported preliminary clinical safety, tolerability and activity data as of a data cutoff date of September 2, 2024 from our first-in-human monotherapy study of zoldonrasib, which we refer to as the RMC-9805-001 study in patients with previously treated solid tumors harboring KRAS G12D mutations.

We believe that these data support our ongoing development of zoldonrasib as a single agent and in combination with other therapies, including with daraxonrasib. An exploratory combination study of zoldonrasib with daraxonrasib is ongoing. We currently expect to disclose additional zoldonrasib clinical safety and antitumor activity data in the second quarter of 2025.

We currently expect to initiate one or more pivotal combination studies in 2026 that incorporate either zoldonrasib or elironrasib and currently expect to share clinical data supporting these plans in the second or third quarter of 2025.

RMC-5127

RMC-5127 is designed as a RAS(ON) oral G12V-selective inhibitor. It is designed to exhibit picomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of RAS G12V-bearing cancer cells and is engineered for selective inhibition of RAS G12V over other RAS isoforms via non-covalent binding interactions. We currently expect to advance RMC-5127 to a clinic-ready stage in 2025 and to initiate a first-in-human dose escalation clinical trial of RMC-5127 in 2026.

RMC-0708

RMC-0708 is designed as a RAS(ON) oral Q61H-selective inhibitor. It is designed to exhibit picomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of RAS Q61H-bearing cancer cells and is engineered for selective inhibition of RAS Q61H over other RAS isoforms via non-covalent binding interactions. Clinical development of RMC-0708 is subject to our continuing assessment of our portfolio priorities.

RMC-8839

RMC-8839 is designed as a RAS(ON) oral G13C-selective inhibitor. It is designed to exhibit picomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of KRAS G13C-bearing cancer cells and is engineered to covalently inactivate KRAS G13C for irreversible inhibition. Clinical development of RMC-8839 is subject to our continuing assessment of our portfolio priorities.

Other Development Opportunities

We have developed RAS companion inhibitors that are designed to suppress cooperating targets and pathways that sustain RAS-addicted cancers. These compounds include RMC-4630, which is designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of SHP2; RMC-5552,

91

which is designed as a selective inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling in tumors; and RMC-5845, which is designed to target SOS1 a protein that plays a key role in converting RAS(OFF) to RAS(ON) in cells. Additional clinical development of our RAS companion inhibitors is subject to our continuing assessment of our portfolio priorities. 

We are also developing preclinical next-generation programs that are designed to sustain our innovation platform beyond our current development-stage assets.

Acquisition of EQRx, Inc.

On November 9, 2023 (the Closing Date), we completed the acquisition of EQRx, Inc. (the EQRx Acquisition), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 31, 2023 (the Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, EQRx, LLC survived as our wholly owned subsidiary.

On the Closing Date, each share of EQRx, Inc. common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the EQRx Acquisition was converted into the right to receive 0.1112 shares of our common stock. Outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards of EQRx, Inc. were also converted into our common stock subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. We issued 54.8 million shares of our common stock and paid $4.0 million in taxes to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the EQRx Acquisition.

As a result of the EQRx Acquisition, we acquired $1.1 billion in net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities after deducting estimated EQRx wind-down and transaction costs.

For additional information regarding the terms of the EQRx Acquisition, see “Note 3. Acquisition” in the  “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Aethon Collaboration

In March 2024, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aethon Therapeutics, Inc. (Aethon) pursuant to which Aethon is conducting research related to use of novel bispecific antibodies to mount an immune attack directed at the cancer cells targeted by our RAS(ON) Inhibitors (the Aethon Collaboration Agreement). Pursuant to the Aethon Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to reimburse Aethon for preclinical activities, and we have an option to conduct any clinical or commercial development that may arise from the collaboration.

Financial Operations Overview

Collaboration revenue

Collaboration revenue consisted of revenue under the Sanofi Agreement for our SHP2 program. We received a $50.0 million upfront payment from Sanofi in July 2018 and received reimbursement for research and development services. The Sanofi Agreement was terminated in June 2023.

For further information on our revenue recognition policies, see “Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Research and development expenses

We substantially rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing. We estimate research and development expenses based on estimates of services performed, and we rely on third party contractors and vendors to provide us with timely and accurate estimates of expenses of services performed to assist us in these estimates. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and costs associated with identifying compounds through our discovery platform, which include:

•
external costs incurred under agreements with third-party contract organizations, investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf and consultants;

•
costs related to the production of preclinical, clinical and pre-launch materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;

•
laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of discovery programs, preclinical and clinical trials;

•
employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; and

92

•
facilities and other expenses, which include allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense, information technology and other supplies.

We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, collaborators and third-party service providers. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and recorded as prepaid assets. The prepaid amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered or as services are performed.

We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in discovering and developing product candidates and advancing product candidates into later stages of development, which may include conducting larger clinical trials. The process of conducting the necessary research and development and clinical trials to seek regulatory approval for product candidates is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or clinical trials or if and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates, if approved.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, consultants and professional services expenses, including legal, audit, accounting and human resources services, insurance, commercial preparation activities, allocated facilities and information technology costs, and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Facilities costs consist of rent, utilities and maintenance of facilities. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to anticipated increases in operating and commercial preparation activities, which may result in increases in personnel-related costs associated with increased headcount, other administrative and professional services, and related overhead needed to support these efforts.

Interest income

Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on and accretion of our cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Collaboration revenue

Collaboration revenue consisted of revenue under the Sanofi Agreement, which was terminated in June 2023. Collaboration revenue decreased by $23.8 million, or 67%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in collaboration revenue in 2023 was a result of lower reimbursed expenses from Sanofi.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses increased by $170.1 million, or 67%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $72.6 million increase in daraxonrasib expenses, primarily attributable to clinical trial and clinical supply manufacturing expenses as daraxonrasib commenced clinical trials at the end of the second quarter of 2022; a $24.1 million increase in salaries and other employee-related expenses due to increased headcount to support our research and development programs; a $17.0 million increase in our preclinical research portfolio expenses; a $16.0 million increase in stock-based compensation including $3.7 million in connection with the EQRx Acquisition; a $15.8 million increase in zoldonrasib expenses, which commenced clinical trials in the third quarter of 2023; a $12.9 million increase in facilities and other allocated expenses as a result of higher rent, utilities and information technology expenses associated with increased headcount; a $12.6 million increase in elironrasib expenses, which commenced clinical trials in the third quarter of 2022; and a $8.2 million increase in employee-related expenses in connection with the EQRx Acquisition; partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in SHP2 costs.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $35.0 million, or 86%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $14.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense including $7.5 million in connection with the EQRx Acquisition; a $7.1 million increase in salaries and other employee-related expenses due to increased headcount; a $6.1 million increase in employee-related expenses in connection with the EQRx Acquisition; a $3.2 million increase in facilities and other allocated expenses as a result of higher rent, utilities and information technology expenses associated with increased headcount; a $2.3 million increase in legal and accounting fees; and a $1.6 million increase in pre-commercial development expenses.

Interest income

Interest income increased by $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022 due to a larger cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance and higher interest rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In November 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, an affiliate of TD Securities (USA) LLC (TD Cowen), as amended in March 2024, to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $250 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2021 ATM). From November 2021 to August 2024, we sold an aggregate of 6,502,078 shares of our common stock under the 2021 ATM, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $186.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,294,050 shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM, resulting in gross proceeds of $60.8 million. In August 2024, we terminated the 2021 ATM and entered into a new sales agreement with TD Cowen to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $500 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2024 ATM). Through December 31, 2024, we have sold an aggregate of 1,147,893 shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM, resulting in gross proceeds of $60.4 million.

In July 2022, we issued 13,225,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, for net proceeds of $248.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $15.9 million and offering expenses of $0.5 million.

In March 2023, we issued 15,681,818 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $22.00 per share, for net proceeds of $323.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $20.7 million and expenses of $0.6 million.

In November 2023, we completed the EQRx Acquisition and issued 54,786,528 shares of common stock in the transaction in which we received approximately $1.1 billion in net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities after deducting EQRx wind-down and transition costs.

In December 2024, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering (i) 16,576,088 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $46.00 per share and (ii) pre‑funded warrants to certain investors to purchase an aggregate of 2,173,917 shares of our common stock at a price of $45.9999 per pre-funded warrant. Each pre-funded warrant will be exercisable from the date of issuance until fully exercised, subject to an ownership limitation. Total net proceeds from the offering were $823.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $38.8 million and expenses of $0.6 million.

Our operations have been financed primarily by our public offerings of common stock, the EQRx Acquisition and $188.7 million received under the Sanofi Agreement from June 2018 through June 2023 for upfront payments and for research and development cost reimbursement.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures related to our product candidates and our pre-clinical research portfolio, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance our product candidates into later stages of development, which includes conducting larger clinical trials, and increase our efforts of preparing to become a commercial-stage company.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our planned operations for at least 12 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The timing and amount of our future funding requirements depends on many factors, including:

•
the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and programs, and of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;

•
the cost of manufacturing our current and future product candidates for clinical trials in preparation for marketing approval and in preparation for commercialization;

•
the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining marketing approvals for our product candidates if clinical trials are successful;

•
the cost of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates, whether alone or in collaboration, including marketing, sales and distribution costs if any product candidate is approved for sale;

•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic licenses or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;

•
the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;

96

•
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, profit share or royalties on, our future products, if any;

•
the emergence of competing cancer therapies or other adverse market developments; and

•
any plans to acquire or in-license other programs or technologies.

We will require substantial additional financing for our development efforts for our current and future programs and to prepare for their potential commercialization. We do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for these activities, and we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, credit or loan facilities, acquisitions, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to (i) delay, limit, reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, or other research and development activities or eliminate one or more of our development programs altogether; or (ii) delay, limit, reduce the scope of or terminate our efforts to establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize any future approved products, or reduce our flexibility in developing or maintaining our sales and marketing strategy.

Cash used in operating activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities of $557.4 million was attributable to a net loss of $600.1 million, partially offset by $42.3 million in non-cash charges and by a net change of $0.4 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $79.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $7.6 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $4.2 million, offset by net amortization of premium on marketable securities of $44.6 million and change in the fair value of warrant liability and contingent earn-out shares of $4.3 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $5.9 million increase in other noncurrent assets, a $6.5 million decrease in accounts payable, offset by a $22.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily related to clinical trial and clinical supply manufacturing expenses and increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and a $1.3 million decrease in accounts receivable.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities of $350.6 million was attributable to a net loss of $436.4 million, partially offset by $49.0 million in non-cash charges and by a net change of $36.8 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $61.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $6.1 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $3.2 million, offset by net amortization of premium on marketable securities of $22.2 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $4.5 million decrease in deferred revenue associated with the Sanofi Agreement, a $1.5 million decrease in operating lease liability, a $3.9 million decrease in deferred tax liability, a $1.4 million increase in other noncurrent assets, offset by a $32.5 million increase in accounts payable, $14.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily related to clinical trial and clinical supply manufacturing expenses and increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and a $3.4 million decrease in accounts receivable.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities of $224.4 million was attributable to a net loss of $248.7 million and by a net change of $13.5 million in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $37.8 million in non-cash charges. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $31.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $5.0 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $4.6 million offset by net amortization of premium on marketable securities of $3.1 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily resulting from the timing of prepayments made for research and development activities, a $14.5 million decrease in deferred revenue associated with the Sanofi Agreement, a $2.4 million decrease in operating

97

lease liability, offset by a $7.3 million increase in accounts payable, $1.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $1.3 million decrease in accounts receivable.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments	

We have contractual obligations related to our office and laboratory space lease in Redwood City, California, described in “Note 7. Commitments and contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical trial materials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes which are generally cancelable at any time by us upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice.

Indemnification Agreements

We enter into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is not determinable. We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, we believe the fair value of these agreements is minimal.

Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.

98

GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which such entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under arrangements, we perform the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

We enter into collaboration agreements under which we may obtain upfront license fees, research and development funding, and development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments. Our performance obligations under these arrangements may include licenses of intellectual property, sales and distribution rights, research and development services, delivery of manufactured product and/or participation on joint steering committees.

Licenses of intellectual property:
 If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from upfront license fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring proportional performance for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of proportional performance each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.

Research, development and regulatory milestone payments:
 At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development, or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price. We use the most likely amount method for research, development and regulatory milestone payments. Under the most likely amount method, an entity considers the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price.

Sales-based milestones and royalties:
 For arrangements that include sales-based milestone or royalty payments based on the level of sales, and in which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the sales-based milestone or royalties relate to, we recognize revenue in the period in which the sales-based milestone is achieved and in the period in which the sales associated with the royalty occur. To date, we have not recognized any sales-based milestone or royalty revenue resulting from our collaboration arrangements.

The transaction price for each collaboration agreement is determined based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled for satisfying all performance obligations within the agreement. Significant judgment may be required in determining the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. We use the most likely amount method to determine variable consideration and will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur.

99

Revenue is recognized based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs to be incurred over the performance obligation as we fulfill our performance obligations. A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires management to make estimates of costs to complete our performance obligations. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated costs to fulfill our performance obligations will be recorded in the period in which changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated.

Accrued research and development expenses

We accrue for estimated costs of research and development activities performed by third-party service providers, which include pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated services provided but not yet invoiced and include these costs in accrued expenses and other payables in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We accrue for these costs based on various factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with our third-party service providers. Further, we accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the related agreement. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.

Stock-based compensation

We maintain an equity incentive plan as a long-term incentive for employees, consultants and members of our board of directors. The plan allows for the issuance of non-statutory options (NSOs), incentive stock options (ISOs), restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) to employees and NSOs and RSUs to nonemployees.

Stock-based compensation is measured using estimated grant date fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the service period in which the awards are expected to vest. The grant date fair value of an RSU award is based on our stock price on the date of grant. For options, we estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and we use the straight-line method for expense attribution. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculations, including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of our common stock, the related risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend. We have elected to recognize forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:

•
Expected Term
—The expected term is calculated using the simplified method, which is available where there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method.

•
Expected Volatility
—Given that we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility of the Company and comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.

•
Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option.

•
Expected Dividend
—We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of the expected impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest rate risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income

100

from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality and short-term duration, invested in compliance with our policy.

We held cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consisted of bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government agency bonds, commercial paper and corporate bonds. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant for us. Due to the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable securities, an immediate one percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Foreign currency risk

Our expenses are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have entered into a limited number of contracts with vendors for research and development services with payments denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, British Pound and Chinese Yuan. We are subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our contracts denominated in foreign currencies. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our consolidated financial statements, and we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Revolution Medicines, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

103

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the Company’s own research and development activities and are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of salaries and benefits, including associated stock-based compensation, and laboratory supplies and facility costs, as well as external costs paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on the Company’s behalf. As disclosed by management, certain development activities are based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to the Company by its vendors, collaborators and third-party service providers. Management estimates research and development expenses based on estimates of services performed and relies on third party contractors and vendors to provide timely and accurate estimates of expenses of services performed to assist in these estimates. The Company’s research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $592.2 million, a majority of which relates to external research and development costs.

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to external research and development costs is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s external research and development costs.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to external research and development costs. These procedures also included, among others, testing external research and development costs on a sample basis by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as the underlying contract research organization agreements, purchase orders, invoices received, and information received from certain third party service providers, where applicable.

REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization
Revolution Medicines, Inc. (the Company) is a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on developing novel targeted therapies for RAS-addicted cancers. The Company was founded in October 2014 and is headquartered in Redwood City, California.
Liquidity
The Company has incurred net operating losses in each year since inception. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
1.7
 billion
. Management believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable the Company to fund its planned operations for at least 12 months following the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company has been able to fund its operations through the issuance and sale of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, the acquisition of EQRx, Inc. (EQRx), and upfront payments and research and development cost reimbursement received under the Company’s prior collaboration agreement with Genzyme Corporation, an affiliate of Sanofi. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending on research and development. There can be no assurance that, in the event the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital and reduce discretionary spending should additional capital not become available could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to achieve its business objectives.
Public offerings
In July 2022, the Company issued and sold 
13,225,000
 shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 
1,725,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock) at a price to the public of $
20.00
 per share, for net proceeds of $
248.1
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
15.9
 million and expenses of $
0.5
 million.
In March 2023, the Company issued and sold 
15,681,818
 shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 
2,045,454
 shares of the Company’s common stock) at a price to the public of $
22.00
 per share, for net proceeds of $
323.7
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
20.7
 million and expenses of $
0.6
 million.
In December 2024, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering (i) 
16,576,088
 shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 
2,445,652
 shares of the Company’s common stock) at a price to the public of $
46.00
 per share and (ii) pre‑funded warrants to certain investors to purchase an aggregate of 
2,173,917
 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $
45.9999
 per pre-funded warrant. Each pre-funded warrant will be exercisable from the date of issuance until fully exercised, subject to an ownership limitation. Total net proceeds were $
823.0
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
38.8
 million and expenses of $
0.6
 million.
In November 2021, the Company entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, an affiliate of TD Securities (USA) LLC (TD Cowen), as amended in March 2024, to sell shares of its common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $
250
 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2021 ATM Program). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold an aggregate of 
339,302
 shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $
10.4
 million, with net proceeds to the Company of $
10.1
 million after deducting commissions and expenses. During the year ended
 December 31, 2023
, the Company sold an aggregate of 
2,482,880
 shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $
63.5
 million, with net proceeds to the Company of $
62.1
 million after deducting commissions and expenses
. During the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company sold an aggregate of 
1,294,050
 shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program, resulting in gross proceeds of $
60.8
 million, with net proceeds to the Company of $
59.2
 million after deducting commissions and expenses.
In August 2024, the Company entered into a new sales agreement with TD Cowen to sell shares of the Company’s common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross proceeds of up to $
500
 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2024 ATM Program). The 2024 ATM Program replaced the 2021 ATM Program and any unused balance remaining under the 2021 ATM Program is no longer available. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company sold an aggregate of 
1,147,893
 shares

109

of 
common stock under the 2024 ATM Program, resulting in gross proceeds of $
60.4
 million, with net proceeds to the Company of $
59.5
 million after deducting commissions and expenses.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding financial reporting

and, in the opinion of management, include all normal and recurring adjustments which are necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the reported periods. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional and reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related purchase price allocation, revenue recognition, clinical accruals, income taxes, useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangibles, impairment of in-process research and development and developed technologies, the incremental borrowing rate for determining operating lease assets and liabilities, warrant liabilities and stock-based compensation. Estimates are based on historical experience, complex judgments, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results could materially differ from the Company’s estimates, and there may be changes to the estimates in future periods.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds, commercial paper, government securities and corporate bonds with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Marketable securities
Investments in marketable securities primarily consist of U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government agency bonds, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. The Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale and may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. The Company views these marketable securities as available to support current operations and classifies marketable securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets. The Company’s investments in marketable securities are carried at estimated fair value, which is derived from independent pricing sources based on quoted prices in active markets for similar securities. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company periodically evaluates its investments to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired. The Company considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge. If the Company determines that the decline in an investment’s fair value is other-than-temporary, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 other-than-temporary-impairment has been recorded.
Restricted cash

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
3.7
 million
 and $
3.0
 million
, respectively, of noncurrent restricted cash related to Company issued letters of credit in connection with leases. These amounts are held in separate bank accounts to support letter of credit agreements for certain of its leases.

110

Concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company maintains bank deposits in federally insured financial institutions and these deposits may exceed federally insured limits. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its bank deposits and issuers of its investments. The Company’s investment policy limits investments to money market funds, certain types of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, certificates of deposit, corporate debt and commercial paper, and places restrictions on the credit ratings, maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents or investments.
Fair value measurement
The carrying amounts of the Company’s certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities and market interest rates, if applicable. For more information, refer to Note 4 regarding the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale securities.
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:
Level  1—Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level  2—Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and
Level  3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Property and equipment, net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally 
three
 to 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
Useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:

Property and equipment

Estimated useful life

Laboratory equipment

4
-
5 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term

Computer equipment and software

3 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

111

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception and then classifies the lease as operating or financing based on the underlying terms and conditions of the contract. Leases with terms greater than one year are initially recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term and in a similar economic environment of the applicable country or region. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 
Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for indications of possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent an asset group is not recoverable, and the carrying amount exceeds the projected discounted future cash flows arising from these assets. There were 
no
 impairments of long-lived assets for any of the periods presented.
Acquired intangible assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the estimated fair value assigned to in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination. The Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, then it is written down to its adjusted fair value. As of December 31, 2024
, there have been 
no
 such impairments. For IPR&D, if a product candidate derived from the indefinite-lived intangible asset is developed and commercialized, the useful life will be determined, and the carrying value will be amortized prospectively over that estimated useful life. Alternatively, if a product candidate is abandoned, the carrying value of the intangible asset will be charged to research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective finite-lived intangible assets and is included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 such impairment has been recorded.
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative indicators assessed include consideration of macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the Company’s overall financial performance and personnel or strategy changes. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 goodwill impairment has been identified.
Warrants
Warrants assumed as part of the EQRx transaction as described in Note 3 contain provisions that require them to be classified as derivative liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). Accordingly, at the end of each reporting period, changes in fair value during the period are recognized as a change in fair value of warrant liabilities within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company adjusts the warrant liabilities for changes in the fair value until the earlier of (a) the exercise or expiration of the warrants or (b) the redemption of the warrants, at which time the warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.

112

Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as noncurrent liabilities, as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company enters into collaboration agreements under which it may obtain upfront license fees, research and development funding, and development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments. The Company’s performance obligations under these arrangements may include licenses of intellectual property, sales and distribution rights, research and development services, delivery of manufactured product and/or participation on joint steering committees.
Licenses of intellectual property: 
If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue from upfront license fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring proportional performance for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. The Company evaluates the measure of proportional performance each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Research, development and regulatory milestone payments: 
At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development, or regulatory milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company uses the most likely amount method for research, development and regulatory milestone payments. Under the most likely amount method, an entity considers the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price.
Sales-based milestones and royalties: 
For arrangements that include sales-based milestone or royalty payments based on the level of sales, and in which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the sales-based milestone or royalties relate to, the Company recognizes revenue in the period in which the sales-based milestone is achieved and in the period in which the sales associated with the royalty occur. To date, the Company has not recognized any sales-based milestone or royalty revenue resulting from its collaboration arrangements.
Deferred revenue represents amounts received by the Company for which the related revenues have not been recognized because one or more of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. The current portion of deferred revenue represents the amount to be recognized within one year from the balance sheet date based on the estimated performance period of the underlying performance obligation. The noncurrent portion of deferred revenue represents amounts to be recognized after one year through the end of the performance period of the performance obligation.
Research and development expenditures
Research 
and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the Company’s own and for collaborative research and development activities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of salaries and benefits, including associated stock-based compensation, and laboratory supplies and facility costs, as well as external costs paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on the Company’s behalf. The Company estimates preclinical studies and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions, contract research organizations and clinical manufacturing organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on the Company’s behalf based on actual time and expenses incurred by them. Further, the Company accrues expenses related to clinical

113

trials 
based on the level of patient activity according to the related agreement. The Company monitors patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and adjusts estimates accordingly.
Stock-based compensation
The Company measures its stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards and recognizes the compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of options issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock units are valued based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
Comprehensive loss
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, other comprehensive income (loss) included net unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities.
Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Management makes an assessment of the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to the Company’s historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in facts occurs. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of interest expense.
Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (including pre-funded warrants) outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Shares of common stock into which the pre-funded warrants may be exercised are considered outstanding for the purposes of computing net loss per share because the shares may be issued for little or no consideration, are fully vested and are exercisable without being subject to any conditions after the original issuance date. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, common stock subject to repurchase related to unvested restricted stock awards and early exercise of stock options are considered to be potentially dilutive securities. Basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities as the redeemable convertible preferred stock is considered a participating security because it participates in dividends with common stock. The Company also considers the shares issued upon the early exercise of stock options subject to repurchase to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a dividend is paid on common stock. The holders of all series of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the holders of early exercised shares subject to repurchase do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. As such, the net loss was attributed entirely to common stockholders. Because the Company has reported a net loss for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for those periods.
Segment reporting
The Company determines its operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (CODM) views and analyzes the segment’s operations and performance and allocates resources. The 
President and Chief Executive Officer
 is the CODM. The CODM utilizes net loss as the measure of segment profit or loss. The Company has 
one
 operating and reportable segment. 
The 
Company’s CODM manages the Company’s operations on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The CODM assesses performance for and decides how to allocate resources based on the company’s cash and investment balance, periodic changes in cash and investments, and net loss, all of which are reported on the company’s consolidated 

114

balance 
sheets, statements of operations and/or statements of cash flows. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total consolidated assets.
 All of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States.
In addition to the significant expense categories included within consolidated net loss presented on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, see below for disaggregated amounts that comprise research and development expenses:

3. Acquisition
On November 9, 2023 (the Closing Date), the Company completed the acquisition of EQRx (the EQRx Acquisition). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 31, 2023 (the Merger Agreement), EQRx, LLC survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

On the Closing Date, each share of EQRx common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the EQRx Acquisition was converted into the right to receive 
0.1112
 shares of the Company’s common stock. Outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards of EQRx were also converted into the Company’s common stock, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Company issued 
54.8
 million shares of the Company’s common stock and paid $
4.0
 million in taxes to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the EQRx Acquisition.
The EQRx Acquisition provided the Company with additional financing through the acquisition of EQRx’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which comprised the majority of the net assets acquired from EQRx. As the Company primarily acquired these monetary assets, the EQRx Acquisition was accounted for as a capital-raising transaction with an asset acquisition component. EQRx does not meet the definition of a business under Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), due to the fair value of EQRx, excluding cash and cash equivalents, as of the date of the EQRx Acquisition, being concentrated primarily in one asset class, marketable securities.
Under the asset acquisition method of accounting, the purchase consideration was allocated and recorded by the Company on a fair value basis to the net assets acquired on the Closing Date. Any excess fair value of net assets of EQRx over the cost of the acquisition following determination of the actual purchase consideration is allocated to EQRx’s qualifying assets under ASC 805. As there were no qualifying assets acquired the excess fair value of net assets under ASC 805 was recorded to equity, as a capital-raising transaction. Because EQRx had wound down the majority of its research and development activities and its operations by the time of the Closing Date, the net assets being acquired are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
The following table reflects the consideration transferred by the Company:

Transaction costs of $
20.7
 million incurred by the Company to complete the EQRx Acquisition were accounted for as a direct reduction to the Company’s additional paid-in capital, as these costs were primarily incurred to issue Revolution Medicines common stock as part of the capital-raising transaction
.
In connection with the EQRx Acquisition, certain unvested outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards of EQRx were accelerated and converted into the Company’s common stock. As a result, the fair-value of the unvested portion of the accelerated EQRx equity awards of $
11.2
 million was recognized as a post-combination expense and included in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023.
In connection with the EQRx Acquisition, as of the Closing Date, all public warrants of EQRx that were outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Closing Date were converted into 
11,039,957
 publicly traded warrants (Public Warrants) and 
8,693,333
 private placement warrants of the Company (Private Warrants and, together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase 
0.1112
 shares of the Company’s common stock, at an exercise price of $
11.50
 per such fractional share. The fair value of the Warrants on the Closing Date of $
6.9
 million was included in the purchase price. The Warrants expire in 
December 2026
. The Public Warrants and Private Warrants met liability classification requirements because the Warrants contain provisions whereby adjustments to the settlement amount of the Warrants are based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a “fix-for-fixed” option and the existence of the potential for net cash settlement for the Warrant holders in the event of a tender offer. In addition, the Private Warrants are potentially subject to a different settlement amount depending upon the holder of the Private Warrants, which precludes them from being considered indexed to the entity’s own stock. Therefore, the Warrants are classified as liabilities.

Prior to the EQRx Acquisition, holders of rights to EQRx earn-out shares held in escrow were entitled to receive additional shares of EQRx common stock for no consideration upon the occurrence of certain stock price-based triggering events (the earn-out shares). The earn-out shares were converted in the same manner as all other shares of EQRx common stock under the Merger Agreement and holders of rights to earn-out shares were entitled to receive up to 
5,560,000
 shares of common stock of the Company, subject to the triggering events. 
No
 triggering events occurred and the rights to the earn-out shares expired on 
December 17, 2024
.

Money market funds are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices. U.S. government debt securities, government agency bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate bonds are measured at fair value, which is derived from independent pricing sources based on quoted prices in active markets for similar securities.
There were 
no
 transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 for any of the periods presented.
The fair value of the warrant liabilities was based on observable listed prices for such warrants. The fair value of the public warrants is categorized as Level 1. The fair value of the private warrants is categorized as Level 2 as they are equivalent to the public warrants as they have substantially the same terms; however, they are not actively traded.
The contingent earn-out liability accounted for under ASC 815 is categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates projections utilizing unobservable inputs.

Commitments and contingencies
Leases
In January 2015, as amended in September 2016, the Company entered into an operating lease for approximately 
42,000
 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 700 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 700 Building), with a term through 
April 2023
. In April 2020, the Company amended the lease to lease an additional 
19,000
 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space located at 300 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 300 Building), and to extend the lease term through 
December 2030
. In November 2021, the Company amended the lease to lease an additional 
41,000
 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space located at 800 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 800 Building), and to extend the lease term through 
November 2033
. In March 2023, the Company amended the lease to lease an additional approximately 
40,000
 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space located at 900 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 900 Building), and to extend the lease term through December 31, 2035. 
The Company has the option to extend the lease for an additional 
ten years
 after December 31, 2035. The Company obtained possession of the 900 Building in October 2023.
 In July 2024, the Company amended its Redwood City lease to lease an additional approximately 
43,000
 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space located at 500 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 500 Building). 
The Company has the option to extend the lease for an additional 
ten years
 after the first anniversary of the lease commencement date of the 500 Building.
 In November 2024, the Company amended its Redwood City lease to lease an additional approximately 
46,961
 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space located at 600 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California (the 600 Building). 
The Company has the option to extend the lease for an additional 
ten years
 after the first anniversary of the lease commencement date of the 600 Building.
 Additionally, in November 2024, the Company also entered into a sublease agreement pursuant to which approximately 
23,481
 square feet of office space located on the first floor of the 600 Building was subleased. 
The term of the sublease is through October 2027, with no options to extend.
 The sublease is accounted for as an operating lease.
The Company maintains letters of credit for the benefit of the landlord which are classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash related to letters of credit due to the landlord was $
3.7
 million
 and $
2.4
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Through December 31, 2024
, the landlord had provided the Company with $
16.3
 million in tenant improvement allowances, which were recognized as lease incentives. The lease incentives are being amortized as an offset to rent expense over the lease term in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

121

Upon the execution of the lease amendment in March 2023, which was deemed to be a lease modification, the Company re-evaluated the assumptions used during the lease amendment in November 2021. The Company determined the amendment consists of two separate contracts under ASC 842. One contract is related to a new right-of-use asset for the 900 Building, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, and the other is related to the modification of the lease term, as amended in November 2021, for the 700 Building, 300 Building and 800 Building. As a result, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset and a lease liability of $
25.0
 million for the 900 Building and an aggregate increase of $
0.3
 million to the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the 700 Building, 300 Building and 800 Building upon execution of the lease amendment. The Company is recognizing rent expense for the buildings on a straight-line basis through the remaining extended term of the lease.
Upon the execution of the lease in July 2024, the Company determined that the contract is related to a new right-of-use asset for the 500 Building, which is being accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842. Upon obtaining possession of the building in October 2024, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset of $
18.2
 million, a lease liability of $
21.8
 million and a lease receivable of $
3.6
 million for the 500 Building. The Company is recognizing rent expense for the buildings on a straight-line basis through the term of the lease.
Upon the execution of the lease in November 2024, the Company determined that the contract is related to a new right-of-use asset for the 600 Building, which is being accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842. The Company recorded a right-of-use asset and a lease liability of $
26.3
 million for the 600 Building. The Company is recognizing rent expense for the buildings on a straight-line basis through the remaining extended term of the lease.

Operating lease liabilities are based on the net present value of the remaining lease payments over the remaining lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability was 
7.66
%. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the weighted-average remaining lease term is 
11.0
 years and 
12.0
 years, respectively.
Legal matters
From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business activities. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
On December 9, 2024, 
Nemeth v. Casdin, et al
., Case No. 2024-1268-KSJM (Del. Ch.), was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Complaint) arising from CM Life Sciences III., Inc.’s (CMLS III) December 17, 2021 merger with EQRx., Inc. (Legacy EQRx) (the Merger). The Complaint was filed by former stockholders of CMLS III and brings claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against members of CMLS III’s board of directors, CMLS III’s officers, and CMLS III’s sponsor in connection with the Merger. The Complaint also brings claims for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against certain investment firms involved with the merger process, the Company, solely as successor-in-interest to EQRx, and Legacy EQRx’s former Executive Chairman and CEO, Alexis Borisy, who is also on the Company’s board of directors. Defendants’ response to the Complaint is due on February 28, 2025.

At this juncture, the Company does not believe this action will have a material adverse impact on its operations or financial position. The Company is currently unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss, if any, nor estimate a range of possible loss.
Indemnification
The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these arrangements is not determinable. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the fair value of these agreements is minimal.

Other
The Company enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical trial materials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes which are generally cancelable at any time by the Company upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice.

9. Sanofi collaboration agreement
In June 2018, the Company entered into a collaborative research, development and commercialization agreement (the Sanofi Agreement) with Aventis, Inc. (an affiliate of Sanofi) to research and develop SHP2 inhibitors, including RMC-4630, for any indications. The Sanofi Agreement was assigned to Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi affiliate, in December 2018. For the purposes of this discussion, the Company refers to Genzyme Corporation as Sanofi. The Sanofi Agreement was terminated in June 2023.
Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, the Company granted Sanofi a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable (subject to the Company’s consent in certain circumstances) license under certain of the Company’s patents and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize SHP2 inhibitors, including RMC-4630, for any and all uses, subject to the Company’s exercise of rights and performance of obligations under the Sanofi Agreement.
Under the Sanofi Agreement, the Company had primary responsibility for early clinical development of RMC-4630 pursuant to an approved development plan. Sanofi was responsible for reimbursing the Company for all internal and external costs and expenses to perform its activities under approved development plans, except for costs and expenses related to the RMC-4630-03 study, for which Sanofi reimbursed the Company 
50
% of the costs and expenses.

123

Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $
50
 million from Sanofi in July 2018. The Sanofi Agreement included obligations for Sanofi to make certain milestone payments and royalty payments, all of which expired on termination of the Sanofi Agreement.
Upon termination of the Sanofi Agreement, the licenses granted to Sanofi thereunder became fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable and all rights and obligations of Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement reverted to the Company.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company recognized 
zero
, $
11.6
 million and $
35.4
 million of 
collaboration revenue 
associated with this agreement, respectively.

10. Common stock
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company’s certificate of incorporation authorized the Company to issue 
300,000,000
 shares of common stock, at a par value of $
0.0001
 per share. 
Each share of common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote
. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the Board of Directors. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
no
 dividends have been declared to date.
The Company evaluated the pre-funded warrants issued in conjunction with the December 2024 underwritten public offering and concluded that they met the criteria to be classified as equity within additional paid-in-capital. The pre-funded warrants have been classified as equity because they (1) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock, (2) are immediately exercisable, (3) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (4) permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (5) are indexed to the Company’s common stock and (6) meet the equity classification criteria. All of the shares underlying the pre-funded warrants have been included in the weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because the shares may be issued for little or no consideration, are fully vested and are exercisable after the original issuance date of the pre-funded warrants.
The Company has reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:

11. Stock-based compensation
2020 Incentive Award Plan
In February 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan). The 2020 Plan became effective on February 11, 2020. The 2020 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance bonus awards, performance stock unit awards, dividend equivalents, or other stock or cash based awards. Under the 2020 Plan, the Company generally grants stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions only. Options and restricted stock unit awards granted typically vest over a 
four-year
 period, but may be granted with different vesting terms.
Following the effectiveness of the 2020 Plan, the Company ceased making grants under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan). However, the 2014 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under it. Shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2014 Plan that are forfeited or lapse unexercised and which following the effective date of the 2020 Plan were not issued under the 2014 Plan are available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.

124

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In February 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP). Under the ESPP, employees have the ability to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a discount during a series of offering periods of 24 months, each comprised of four six-month purchase periods. The purchase price will be the lower of 
85
% of the closing trading price per share of the Company’s common stock on the first day of an offering period in which an employee is enrolled or 85% of the closing trading price per share on the purchase date, which will occur on the last trading day of each purchase period.
As of December 31, 2024, there have been 
265,470
 shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
3,775,682
 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
4.9
 million
 of unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP.

The aggregate intrinsic values of options outstanding, exercisable, vested and expected to vest were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the options and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock by the Board of Directors. The intrinsic value of the options exercised for the years December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
29.4
 million
, $
10.7
 million and $
3.8
 million, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted was $
22.07
, $
17.82
 and $
12.33
 per share, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024, there was $
118.8
 million
 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.65
 years.
The fair value of employee and director stock option awards was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes model assumptions that determine the fair value of stock-based awards include:
Expected term
—The expected term is calculated using the simplified method, which is available where there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method.
Expected volatility
—Given the Company does not have sufficient trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility of the Company and comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies over a period

125

equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.
Risk-free interest rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
Expected dividend
—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero.
Restricted stock units
Restricted stock units (RSUs) have been granted to employees and directors. The fair value of an RSU award is based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The shares underlying the RSU awards are not issued until the RSUs vest. Upon vesting, each RSU converts into one share of the Company’s common stock. The Company has granted RSUs pursuant to the 2020 plan.

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $
0.8
 million
, 
$
3.5
 million and $
0.4
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which reflects a blended state tax rate applied to the indefinite lived intangibles recorded as part of the Company’s acquisition of Warp Drive Bio in 2018. The Company has incurred net pre-tax losses in the United States for all periods presented. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse.
The benefit from income taxes differs from the amount expected by applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before taxes as follows:

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Due to the lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance excluding certain indefinite lived intangibles. The valuation allowance increased by $
187.2
 million, $
152.6
 million and $
80.7
 million during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
 respectively. The Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
151.8
 million and $
74.7
 million, respectively, as presented in the table above, as of 
December 31, 2024
. The federal net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 
2035
, with the exception of $
132.2
 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely. State net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 
2035
. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), federal net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 do not expire and cannot be carried back. However, the TCJA limits the amount of federal net operating losses that can be used annually to 
80
% of taxable income for periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Existing federal net operating losses arising in years ending on or before December 31, 2017 are not affected by these provisions.
The Company also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $
48.2
 million and $
17.8
 million, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2024
. The federal research credits will expire beginning in 
2034
 if not utilized and the state research credits will expire beginning in 
2031
, with the exception of $
16.8
 million in California research credits, which can be carried forward indefinitely. 
Federal and state tax laws impose significant restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Section 382). The Company performed a study in which it determined that it had experienced changes in ownership in 2014, 2020 and 2023 as defined by Section 382. The Company's deferred tax assets have been reduced by the amount of net operating loss carryforwards expected to expire due to the limitation. In addition, in the future the Company may experience ownership changes, which may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes.
The TCJA amended Internal Revenue Code Section 174 requiring capitalization of specified research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 and amortizing over a period of 5 or 15 years. This resulted in a deferred tax asset for capitalized research expenses in 2024, 2023 and 2022
.

 which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized; however, recognition would be in the form of a deferred tax attribute which would likely be offset by a valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. The Company has recognized 
no
 interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions for the periods presented.

Income tax returns are filed in the United States. The years 2010 through 2024 remain open to examination by the domestic taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. Net operating losses generated on a tax return basis by the Company for 
2010 through 2024

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accou

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent limitation on the effectiveness over financial reporting

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
