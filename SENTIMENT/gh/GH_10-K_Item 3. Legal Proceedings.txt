Overview
We are a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer. We are transforming patient care by providing critical insights into what drives disease through our advanced blood and tissue tests, and real-world data. Our tests help improve outcomes across all stages of care, including screening to find cancer early, monitoring for recurrence in early-stage cancer, and helping doctors select the best treatment for patients with advanced cancer. For patients with advanced-stage cancer, we have commercially launched Guardant360 laboratory developed test, or LDT, and Guardant360 CDx, the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to provide tumor mutation profiling with solid tumors and to be used as a companion diagnostic in connection with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and breast cancer. We have also launched the Guardant360 TissueNext tissue test for advanced-stage cancer, Guardant Reveal blood test to detect residual and recurring disease in early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancer patients, and Guardant360 Response blood test to predict patient response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy eight weeks earlier than current standard-of-care imaging. 
We also collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in clinical studies by providing the above-mentioned tests, as well as the GuardantOMNI blood test for advanced-stage cancer, and the GuardantINFINITY blood test, a next-generation Smart Liquid Biopsy that provides new, multi-dimensional insights into the complexities of tumor molecular profiles and immune response to advance cancer research and therapy development. Using data collected from our tests, we have also developed our GuardantINFORM platform to help biopharmaceutical companies accelerate precision oncology drug development through the use of this in-silico research platform to unlock further insights into tumor evolution and treatment resistance across various biomarker-driven cancers.
For early cancer detection, in May 2022, we launched the Shield LDT test to address the needs of individuals eligible for colorectal cancer screening. From a simple blood draw, Shield uses a novel multimodal approach to detect colorectal cancer signals in the bloodstream, including DNA that is shed by tumors. In December 2022, we announced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of our Shield blood test for detecting colorectal cancer in average-risk adults, met co-primary endpoints. In addition, in March 2023, we submitted a premarket approval application, or PMA, for our Shield blood test to the FDA. In July 2024, we received FDA approval of our Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who are at average risk for the disease, and in August 2024, our Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the FDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning healthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended in screening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for colorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare. We also expect to expand into lung cancer screening and multi-cancer detection with our Shield platform. 
We currently perform clinical, research use only, and investigation use only tests in our laboratory located in Redwood City, California. Our Redwood City laboratory is certified pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, permitted by the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, and licensed in California and four other states. We also perform research use only tests in our laboratory located in San Diego, California. In addition, our Redwood City, San Diego and Palo Alto, California laboratories are currently operated as centers for our research and technology development.  
We generated total revenue of $739.0 million, $563.9 million and $449.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also incurred net losses of $436.4 million, $479.4 million and $654.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We have funded our operations to date 
76
Table of Contents
principally from the sale of our stock, convertible senior notes, and revenue from our precision oncology testing and development services and other. In May 2023, we completed a follow-on underwritten public offering, in which we issued and sold 14,375,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $28.00 per share, and received net proceeds of $381.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $21.1 million. In December 2023, we completed a registered direct offering with an investment management firm, in which we issued and sold 3,387,446 shares of our common stock at a price of $26.77 per share, and received net proceeds of $90.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities of approximately $944.2 million.
Factors affecting our performance
We believe there are several important factors that have impacted and that we expect will impact our operating performance and results of operations, including:
•
Testing volume, pricing and customer mix
.

Our revenue and costs are affected by the volume of testing and mix of customers from period to period. We evaluate both the volume of tests that we perform for patients on behalf of clinicians and the number of tests we perform for biopharmaceutical companies. Our performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden adoption with existing customers, as well as attract new customers. We believe that the test volume we receive from clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are indicators of growth in each of these customer verticals. Customer mix for our tests has the potential to significantly affect our results of operations, as the average selling price for biopharmaceutical sample testing is currently higher than our average reimbursement for clinical tests because we are not a contracted provider for, or our tests are not covered by clinical patients’ insurance for, the majority of the tests that we perform for patients on behalf of clinicians. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests for patients covered and administered by Medicare represented approximately 39%, 43% and 45% of our precision oncology revenue from clinical customers for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
•
Payer coverage and reimbursement
.
 Our revenue depends on achieving broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests from third-party payers, including both commercial and government payers. Precision oncology revenue from tests for clinical customers is calculated based on our expected cash collections, using the estimated variable consideration. The variable consideration is estimated based on historical collection patterns as well as the potential for changes in future reimbursement behavior by one or more payers. Estimation of the impact of the potential for changes in reimbursement requires significant judgment and considers payers' past patterns of changes in reimbursement as well as any stated plans to implement changes. Any cash collections over the expected reimbursement period exceeding the estimated variable consideration are recorded in future periods based on actual cash received. Payment from commercial payers can vary depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “participating provider” or do not have a contract and are considered a “non-participating provider”. Payers often reimburse non-participating providers, if at all, at a lower amount than participating providers. Because we are not contracted with these payers, they determine the amount that they are willing to reimburse us for any of our tests and they can prospectively and retrospectively adjust the amount of reimbursement, adding to the complexity in estimating the variable consideration. When we contract with a payer to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements by the payer are generally made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications or where prior approval has been obtained. Becoming a participating provider can result in higher reimbursement amounts for covered uses of our tests and, potentially, no reimbursement for non-covered uses identified under the payer’s policies or the contract. As a result, the potential for more favorable reimbursement associated with becoming a participating provider may be offset by a potential loss of reimbursement for non-covered uses of our tests. Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, coding plays a significant role in how our tests are reimbursed both from commercial and governmental payers. In addition, Z-Code Identifiers are used by certain payers, including under Medicare's Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, or MolDx, to supplement CPT codes for our molecular diagnostics tests. Changes to the codes used to report to payers may result in significant changes in its reimbursement. If their policies were to change in the future to cover additional cancer indications, we anticipate that our total reimbursement would increase. 
In March 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, approved advanced diagnostic laboratory test, or ADLT, status to our Guardant360 CDx test, based on which Medicare paid us at the lowest available commercial rate per test, from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, Medicare started to reimburse Guardant360 CDx services at the median rate of claims paid by commercial payers. In March 2022, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare administrative contractor for MolDX, conveyed coverage for our Guardant360 TissueNext test under the existing local coverage determination. The policy covers our Guardant360 TissueNext test for Medicare fee-for-service patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. In July 
77
Table of Contents
2022, Palmetto GBA conveyed coverage for our Guardant Reveal test for fee-for-service Medicare patients in the United States with stage II or III colorectal cancer whose testing is initiated within three months following curative intent therapy, with an effective date of December 2021. In April 2023, Palmetto GBA conveyed coverage for our Guardant360 Response test for fee-for-service Medicare patients in the U.S. with metastatic or inoperable solid tumors who are on an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, tested four to ten weeks from therapy initiation. Effective January 1, 2024, Medicare has increased the reimbursement rate for our Guardant360 LDT test to the same rate as our Guardant360 CDx test. In January 2025, Palmetto GBA granted coverage for our Guardant Reveal test to monitor disease recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer in the surveillance setting following curative intent therapy. This represents an expansion from the prior Medicare coverage of our Guardant Reveal test for colorectal cancer in the early post-surgical setting only.
In August 2024, following the FDA approval, our Shield blood test met the coverage requirements by Medicare based on the criteria established in its National Coverage Determination for blood-based colorectal cancer screening tests. The test is covered once every three years for eligible Medicare beneficiaries.
Due to the inherent variability and unpredictability of the reimbursement landscape, including related to the amount that payers reimburse us for any of our tests, we estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized at the time a test is provided and record revenue adjustments if and when the cash subsequently received differs from the revenue recorded. Due to this variability and unpredictability, previously recorded revenue adjustments are not indicative of future revenue adjustments from actual cash collections, which may fluctuate significantly. Additionally, if coding changes were to occur, payments for certain uses of our tests could be reduced, put on hold, or eliminated. This variability and unpredictability could increase the risk of future revenue reversal and result in our failing to meet any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide. 
•
Biopharmaceutical customers
.

Our revenue also depends on our ability to attract, maintain and expand relationships with biopharmaceutical customers. As we continue to develop these relationships, we expect to support a growing number of clinical studies globally and continue to have opportunities to offer our platform to such customers for development services, including companion diagnostic development, novel target discovery and validation, as well as clinical study enrollment. For example, our tests are being developed as companion diagnostics under collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies.
•
Research and development. 
A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development, including the development of new products. In particular, we have invested heavily in clinical studies as we believe these studies are critical to gaining physician adoption and driving favorable coverage decisions by payers. With respect to Guardant Reveal, in October 2021, we initiated a 1,000-patient prospective, observational, multi-center study, which we refer to as the ORACLE study, designed to evaluate the performance of our Guardant Reveal liquid biopsy test to predict cancer recurrence after curative intent treatment, across 11 solid tumor types. In addition, with respect to Guardant Reveal, in December 2022, we entered into a partnership with Susan G. Komen®, the world’s leading breast cancer organization, to bring the patient perspective to the development of clinical studies that help identify early-stage breast cancer patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence and may benefit from additional monitoring or therapy. With respect to Shield, in December 2022, we announced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of our Shield blood test for detecting colorectal cancer in average-risk adults, met co-primary endpoints. The test demonstrated 83% sensitivity in detecting individuals with colorectal cancer. Specificity was 90% in both individuals without advanced neoplasia and in those who had a negative colonoscopy result. These results exceed the performance criteria set forth by the CMS for reimbursement. This test also demonstrated 13% sensitivity in detecting advanced adenomas. Based on these study results, in March 2023, we submitted a PMA to the FDA for our Shield blood test. In July 2024, we received FDA approval of our Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who are at average risk for the disease, and in August 2024, our Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the FDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning healthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended in screening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for colorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare. To clinically validate the performance of our next-generation Shield blood test in lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals ages 50-80, in January 2022, we initiated a nearly 10,000-patient prospective, registrational study, which we refer to as the SHIELD LUNG study. In addition, in January 2025, our Shield multi-cancer detection, or MCD, test was selected for the Vanguard study funded by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. The Vanguard study is a four-year pilot study which will enroll up to 24,000 people to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of MCD tests for cancer screening. We have expended considerable resources, and expect to increase such expenditures over the next few years, to support our research and development programs with the goal of fueling further innovation.

International expansion. 
A component of our long-term growth strategy is to expand our commercial footprint internationally, and we expect to increase our sales and marketing expense to execute on this strategy. We currently offer our tests in countries outside the United States primarily through distributor relationships, direct contracts with hospitals, and partnerships with local research organizations and laboratory companies. 
In May 2018, we formed and capitalized Guardant Health AMEA, Inc., with SoftBank, relating to the sale, marketing and distribution of our tests generally outside the Americas and Europe, and to accelerate commercialization of our products in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In June 2022, we purchased all of the shares held by SoftBank and its affiliates, and upon completion of the transaction, we obtained full control over operations of Guardant Health AMEA, Inc. 
In July 2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted national reimbursement approval for our 
Guardant360 CDx test for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers in Japan. 

In December 2020, we signed our first public private partnership agreement with Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, or VHIO, one of Europe’s leading cancer research institutions, and in May 2022, the first blood-based cancer testing services in Europe based on our digital sequencing platform became available at the VHIO testing facility in Spain. In October 2021, we signed a partnership agreement with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, or Royal Marsden, a premier cancer center within the United Kingdom, or the UK, for patient care, research and teaching of all types of cancer, and in April 2023, the blood-based cancer testing services based on our digital sequencing platform became available at Royal Marsden testing facility in the UK.
 In September 2024, we signed a partnership agreement with the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic Foundation IRCCS, one of Italy’s largest and most renowned hospitals known for its advanced oncology services, including diagnostics, treatment, and research, to establish an in-house liquid biopsy testing service within its hospital system.
In June 2022, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with Adicon Holdings Limited, or Adicon, a leading independent clinical laboratory company based in China, and in December 2023, the blood-based cancer testing services based on our digital sequencing platform became available at Adicon's testing facility, which offers our industry-leading comprehensive genomic profiling tests to biopharmaceutical companies to advance clinical research and the development of new cancer therapies in China.  
The success of our international expansion strategy depends on a number of factors, including the internal and external constraints placed on our international laboratory partners and biopharmaceutical companies in the context of broader global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. For example, deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China may impact international trade, government spending, regional stability and macroeconomic conditions. The impact of these potential developments, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed against governmental or other entities in, for example, China, may contribute to disruption of our international partnerships and instability and volatility in the global markets, which in turn could adversely impact our operations and weaken our financial results.
•
Sales and marketing expense
. 
Our financial results have historically, and will likely continue to, fluctuate significantly based upon the impact of our sales and marketing expense, increase in headcount, and in particular, our various marketing programs around existing and new product introductions. 
•
General and administrative expense
. 
Our financial results have historically, and will likely continue to, fluctuate significantly based upon the impact of our general and administrative expense, and in particular, our stock-based compensation expense. Our equity awards, including market-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are intended to retain and incentivize employees to lead us to sustained, long-term superior financial and operational performance.
•
Other operating expense
. Our financial results might fluctuate significantly based upon the impact of our other operating expense, and in particular, our legal settlement costs, which could potentially decrease or increase significantly. 
While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See Part I, Item 1A, 
“Risk Factors
” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Components of results of operations
Revenue
We derive our revenue from two sources: (i) precision oncology testing, and (ii) development services and other.
Precision oncology testing.
 Precision oncology testing revenue is generated from sales of our tests to clinical and biopharmaceutical customers, including those tests delivered by labs operated by our strategic partners. In the United States, through December 31, 2024, we generally performed tests as an out-of-network service provider without contracts with health insurance companies. We submit claims for payment for tests performed for patients covered by U.S. private payers. We also submit claims to Medicare for reimbursement for our Guardant360 CDx, Guardant360 LDT, Guardant360 TissueNext, Guardant Reveal and Guardant360 Response clinical testing performed for qualifying patients. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests for patients covered and administered by Medicare represented approximately 39%, 43% and 45% of our precision oncology revenue from clinical customers for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Development services and other.
 Development services revenue primarily represents services that we provide to biopharmaceutical companies, large medical institutions and international laboratory partners. We collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in the development and clinical studies of new drugs. As part of these collaborations, we provide services related to regulatory filings to support companion diagnostic device submissions for our test panels. Under these arrangements, we generate revenue from progression of our collaboration efforts, as well as from provision of on-going support. In addition to companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services, we also provide other development services, including clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. Other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing our technologies, kit fulfillment and delivery of our Shield screening tests.
Costs and operating expenses
Cost of precision oncology testing. 
Cost of precision oncology testing generally consists of cost of materials, including inventory write-downs; cost of labor, including employee benefits, bonus, and stock-based compensation; equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing test samples, such as sample accessioning, library preparation, sequencing, and quality control analyses; freight; curation of test results for physicians; phlebotomy; and license fees due to third parties. Infrastructure expenses include depreciation of laboratory equipment, rent costs, depreciation of leasehold improvements and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing our tests are recorded as the tests are performed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to the tests. While we do not believe the technologies underlying the third-party licenses are necessary to permit us to provide our tests, we do believe these technologies are potentially valuable and of possible strategic importance to us or our competitors. 
We expect the cost of precision oncology testing to generally increase in line with the increase in the number of tests we perform, but we expect the cost per test to decrease modestly over time due to the efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases, and from automation and other cost reductions.
Cost of development services and other
. Cost of development services and other primarily includes costs incurred for the performance of development services requested by our biopharmaceutical customers, and costs associated with our partnership agreements and delivery of Shield screening tests, which comprise of labor and material costs including any inventory write-downs. For development of new products, costs incurred before technological feasibility has been achieved are reported as research and development expenses, while costs incurred thereafter are reported as cost of revenue. Cost of development services and other will vary depending on the nature, timing and scope of customer projects.
Research and development expense
. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to develop technology and include salaries and benefits including stock-based compensation, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including facility occupancy and information technology costs, contract services, other outside costs and costs to develop our technology capabilities. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical companies before technological feasibility has been achieved. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are received or services are rendered. Costs to develop our technology capabilities are recorded as research and development unless they meet the criteria to be capitalized as internal-use software costs. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to innovate and develop additional products, expand our genomic and medical data management resources and conduct our ongoing and new clinical studies.

Table of Contents
Sales and marketing expense.
 Our sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct sales force and sales management, client services, marketing and reimbursement, medical affairs, as well as business development personnel who are focused on our biopharmaceutical customers. These expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, travel expenses and stock-based compensation, as well as marketing, sales incentives, and educational activities and overhead expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, increase our presence within and outside of the United States, and increase our marketing activities to drive further awareness and adoption of our tests. 
General and administrative expense
. Our general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and finance, information technology, legal and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, travel expenses and stock-based compensation, as well as professional services fees such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, and general corporate costs and overhead expenses. In addition, our general and administrative expenses also include severance costs related to workforce reduction. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we incur additional costs to support the growth of our business. These expenses, though expected to increase in absolute dollars, are expected to decrease modestly as a percentage of revenue in the long term, though they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses being incurred.
Interest income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities. 
Interest expense
Interest expense consists primarily of charges relating to amortization of debt issuance costs. 
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net consists of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, unrealized and realized gains and losses of marketable equity securities, and impairment of non-marketable equity securities and other related assets. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Provision for income tax
Income taxes are recorded using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if current evidence indicates that it is considered more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a regular basis. The evaluations are based on a number of factors, including changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of the audit, and effective settlement of audit issues. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any accruals that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

In November 2020 and May 2021, we granted restricted stock units with certain performance metrics, or PSUs, consisting of a performance period of 4 years combined with an additional service period requirement of six months should the vesting criteria be met, with a grant date fair value of $113.40 per share and $148.19 per share, respectively. Before 2024, no compensation expense for these PSUs had been recorded since the achievement of the performance metrics did not meet the criteria for accrual. In 2024, the performance metrics of these PSUs were considered to be achieved; as such we recorded $24.8 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these PSUs, based on 219,161 shares granted with fair values of $113.40 per share and $148.19 per share, of which $2.4 million was recorded to cost of development services and other, and $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.1 million was recorded as components of research and development expense, sales and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense, respectively.

Precision oncology testing revenue increased to $687.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $514.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $173.7 million, or 34%. 
Precision oncology revenue from tests for clinical customers was $542.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, up 34% from $403.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in clinical testing revenue was driven primarily by an increase in sample volume and an increase in reimbursement for our tests. Total tests for clinical customers increased to approximately 206,700 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from approximately 172,900 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in reimbursement for our tests for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in Medicare reimbursement for our Guardant360 LDT test to $5,000, effective January 1, 2024; and increases in Medicare Advantage and commercial payer reimbursement. 
Precision oncology revenue from tests for biopharmaceutical customers was $145.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, up 31% from $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in sample volume. Total tests for biopharmaceutical customers increased to approximately 40,500 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from approximately 29,900 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Development services and other revenue increased to $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.4 million, or 3%. This increase in development services and other revenue was primarily due to an increase of $9.1 million associated with our companion diagnostics collaboration projects and other service agreements with biopharmaceutical customers, partially offset by a decrease of $7.2 million associated with our partnership agreements, and a reduction of $3.2 million in royalty revenue. The increase in other revenue was also attributable to $4.1 million derived from the delivery of approximately 6,400 of our Shield screening tests for the three months ended December 31, 2024, following the FDA approval.

Liquidity and capital resources
We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and as of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.6 billion. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the near future and our operating expenses will increase as we continue to invest in clinical studies and develop new products, expand our sales organization, and increase our marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our tests. As demand for our tests are expected to continue to increase from physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements could also increase if we require additional laboratory capacity.
We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of stock, convertible debt and through revenue from precision oncology testing and development services and other. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities of $944.2 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to provide liquidity while ensuring capital preservation. Additionally, we have investments held in marketable debt securities consisting primarily of United States treasury securities that can be immediately liquid. 
Based on our current business plan, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities and anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for more than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may consider raising additional capital to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons. As revenue from precision oncology testing and development services and other is expected to grow long-term, we expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase. Any increase in accounts receivable and inventory may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which could impact our working capital balances.
If our available cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities and anticipated cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements because of lower demand for our products as a result of lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from our customers or other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may seek to sell additional common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all.
At-The-Market Offering Program
In August 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or the Agent, with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $400.0 million through the Agent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, no shares of our common stock were sold under the Sales Agreement.
Convertible Notes Exchange
In February 2025, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible senior notes due 2027. See Note 17, 
Subsequent Events

Critical accounting policies and estimates
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue recognition
We derive revenue from the provision of precision oncology testing services, as well as from development services and other. Precision oncology testing revenue includes amounts derived from the delivery of our precision oncology tests, including those tests delivered by labs operated by our strategic partners. Development services include companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval, clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. Other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing our technologies, kit fulfillment, and delivery of our Shield screening tests. We currently receive payments from third-party commercial and governmental payers, certain hospitals and oncology centers and individual patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, research institutes, international laboratory partners and distributors.
Revenues are recognized when control of services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. FASB ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, provides for a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Precision oncology testing
We recognize revenue from the sale of our precision oncology tests for clinical customers, including certain hospitals, cancer centers, other institutions and patients, at the time results of the test are reported to physicians. Most precision oncology tests requested by clinical customers are sold without a written agreement; however, we determine an implied contract exists with our clinical customers. We identify each sale of our test to a clinical customer as a single performance obligation. With the exception of certain limited contracted arrangements with insurance carriers and other institutions where the transaction price is fixed, a stated contract price does not exist and the transaction price for each implied contract with our clinical customers represents variable consideration. We estimate the variable consideration under the portfolio approach and consider the historical reimbursement data from third-party commercial and governmental payers and patients, as well as known or anticipated reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. We monitor the estimated amount to be collected in the portfolio at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the estimate and any subsequent revision contain uncertainty and require the use of significant judgment in the estimation of the variable consideration and application of the constraint for such variable consideration. We analyze actual cash collections over the expected reimbursement period and compare it with the estimated variable consideration for each portfolio and any difference is recognized as an adjustment to estimated revenue after the expected reimbursement period, subject to assessment of the risk of cumulative future revenue reversal.
Revenue from sales of precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are based on a negotiated price per test or on the basis of an agreement to provide certain testing volume over a defined period. We identify our promise to transfer a number of distinct tests to biopharmaceutical customers as a single performance obligation. Precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are generally billed at a fixed price for each test performed. For agreements involving testing volume to be satisfied over a defined period, revenue is recognized over time based on the number of tests performed as the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Results of our precision oncology services are delivered electronically, and as such there are no shipping or handling fees incurred by us or billed to customers.

Table of Contents
Development services and other
We perform development services for our biopharmaceutical customers utilizing our precision oncology information platform. Development services typically represent a single performance obligation as we perform a significant integration service, such as analytical validation and regulatory submissions. The individual promises are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, are not distinct. However, under certain contracts, a biopharmaceutical customer may engage us for multiple distinct development services which are both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, distinct performance obligations.
We collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in the development of new drugs. As part of these collaborations, we provide services related to regulatory filings to support companion diagnostic device submissions for our testing panels. Under these collaborations, we generate revenue from achievement of milestones, as well as provision of on-going support. For the companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services performed, we are compensated through a combination of an upfront fee and performance-based, non-refundable regulatory and other developmental milestone payments. The transaction price of these contracts typically represents variable consideration. Application of the constraint for variable consideration to milestone payments is an area that requires significant judgment. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be managed to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone. In making this assessment, we consider our historical experience with similar milestones, the degree of complexity and uncertainty associated with each milestone, and whether achievement of the milestone is dependent on parties other than us. The constraint for variable consideration is applied to the transaction price such that it is probable a significant cumulative reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingency is resolved. Application of the constraint for variable consideration is assessed and updated at each reporting period as a revision to the estimated transaction price.
We recognize companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services revenue over the period in which biopharmaceutical research and development services are provided. Specifically, we recognize revenue using an input method to measure progress, utilizing costs incurred to-date relative to total expected costs as its measure of progress. We assess the changes to the total expected cost estimates as well as any incremental fees negotiated resulting from changes to the scope of the original contract in determining the revenue recognition at each reporting period. For development of new products or services under these arrangements, costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are included as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, while costs incurred thereafter are recorded as cost of development services and other.
We also recognize revenue from other development services, in addition to companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services noted above, such as clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect, and GuardantINFORM. These revenues are generally recognized over time based on an input method to measure progress in the period when the associated services have been performed.  
In addition, we license our digital sequencing technologies to our domestic customers and international laboratory partners. For the licensed technology, we are compensated through royalty-based payments, non-refundable upfront payments, guaranteed minimum payments, and/or sample milestone payments. Depending on the nature of the technology licensing arrangements, and considering factors including but not limited to enforceable right to payment and payment terms, and if an asset with alternative use is created, these technology licensing revenues are recognized in the period when royalty-bearing sales occur, when the technology transfer is complete, or over the technology transfer period. Other revenue also includes kit fulfillment, which is recognized when such products are delivered. In addition, other revenue includes amounts derived from delivery of our Shield screening tests.
Contracts with multiple performance obligations
Contracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners may include multiple distinct performance obligations, such as provision of precision oncology testing, the above-mentioned development services, and digital sequencing technology licensing, among others. We evaluate the terms and conditions included within our contracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners to ensure appropriate revenue recognition, including whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. We first identify material promises, in contrast to immaterial promises or administrative tasks, under the contract, and then evaluate whether these promises are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. In assessing whether a promised service is capable of being distinct, we consider whether the customer could benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, including factors such as the research, development, and commercialization capabilities of a third party as well as the availability of the associated expertise in the general 
89
Table of Contents
marketplace. In assessing whether a promised service is distinct within the context of the contract, we consider whether we provide a significant integration of the services, whether the services significantly modify or customize one another, or whether the services are highly interdependent or interrelated.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine standalone selling price by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay, competitive pricing of other vendors, industry publications and current pricing practices, and expected costs of satisfying each performance obligation plus appropriate margin; or by using the residual approach if standalone selling price is not observable, by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
Stock-based compensation
We measure the grant date fair value of our service-based and performance-based restricted stock units issued to employees and non-employees based on the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock units with only service-based vesting conditions, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics, or PSUs, is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, and is recognized using an accelerated attribution model over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. No stock-based compensation expense is recorded for PSUs, unless it is determined to be probable that the related performance metrics will be met. In addition, a cumulative adjustment will be recorded in the period when the probability of achieving the related performance metrics is adjusted. Any PSUs that remain unvested at the end of the performance period will be forfeited. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
We measure stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees, directors, and non-employees on the date of grant based on the fair value of the awards and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Compensation expense for stock options with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant. 
We estimate the fair value of our stock options on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of assumptions regarding a number of variables that are complex, subjective and generally require significant judgment to determine. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our stock options, were:
Fair Value of Common Stock
The fair value of our common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of our common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

The expected term represents the period that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) as we have concluded that our stock option exercise history does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
Expected Volatility
Prior to the commencement of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 4, 2018 in connection with our initial public offering, there was no active trading market for our common stock. Due to limited historical data for the trading of our common stock, expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded peer group companies in the same industry plus our expected volatility for the available periods. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate, with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options.

We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis, including probabilities of meeting performance metrics for our PSUs. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. 
Interest rate risk
We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities and our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities of $944.2 million held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds and U.S. government debt securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in immaterial decline or increase of the fair value of our investments. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.
Foreign currency risk
The majority of our revenue is generated in the United States. Through December 31, 2024, we have generated an insignificant amount of revenues denominated in foreign currencies. As we expand our presence in the international market, our results of operations and cash flows are expected to increasingly be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2024, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Guardant Health, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Guardant Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Precision Oncology Testing Revenue – Estimated Transaction Price for Clinical Customers — Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of precision oncology tests for clinical customers at the time results of the test are reported to physicians. Most precision oncology tests requested by clinical customers are sold without a written agreement; however, the Company determines an implied contract exists with its clinical customers. Except for certain limited contracted arrangements with insurance carriers and other institutions where the transaction price is fixed, a stated contract price does not exist and the transaction price for each implied contract with clinical customers represents variable consideration. The Company estimates the variable consideration under the portfolio approach and considers the historical reimbursement data from third-party commercial and governmental payers and patients, as well as known or anticipated reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data.
The estimated transaction price under the portfolio approach represents consideration the Company expects to receive based on historical payment data from third-party payers and patients, adjusted for known and forecasted changes in payment patterns and subject to a constraint such that revenue recognized is not expected to be reversed. 
93
The Company analyzes its actual cash collections over the expected reimbursement period and compares it with the estimated variable consideration for each portfolio and any difference is recognized as an adjustment to estimated revenue after the expected reimbursement period, subject to assessment of the risk of future revenue reversal. Both the estimate and any subsequent revision contain uncertainty and require the use of significant judgment in the estimation of the variable consideration and application of the constraint for such variable consideration.
We identified management’s estimation of the transaction price for precision oncology tests for clinical customers as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments required by management to estimate payer reimbursements. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of more experienced engagement team members, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the estimated transaction prices for precision oncology tests.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to estimated transaction prices for precision oncology tests for clinical customers, included the following, among others:
•
We understood and tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of the assumptions used and the related review and approval of the estimated transaction prices.
•
We developed an independent expectation of the estimated transaction prices for precision oncology tests for clinical customers in developing an independent expectation of revenue and comparing the recorded amount to our expectation.
•
We tested the assumptions used in our independent expectation of the estimated transaction prices for precision oncology tests for clinical customer by:
•
Testing the historical cash receipts from payers used in the estimate of transaction prices, by making selections and agreeing the selected information to source documents.
▪
Testing the completeness and accuracy of the precision oncology tests for clinical customers reported to physicians used in our independent expectation, by making selections and agreeing the selected information to source documents.
•
We tested management’s ability to estimate transaction prices accurately by comparing recorded revenue to cash receipts received through December 2024.
•
We evaluated trends in estimated transaction prices and revenue compared to previous periods to identify evidence that is inconsistent with management’s assumptions regarding estimated transaction prices.

Guardant Health, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
Description of Business
Guardant Health, Inc., or the Company, is a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer. The Company is transforming patient care by providing critical insights into what drives disease through its advanced blood and tissue tests, and real-world data. The Company's tests help improve outcomes across all stages of care, including screening to find cancer early, monitoring for recurrence in early-stage cancer, and helping doctors select the best treatment for patients with advanced cancer. For patients with advanced stage cancer, the Company has commercially launched Guardant360 LDT and Guardant360 CDx, the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to provide tumor mutation profiling with solid tumors and to be used as a companion diagnostic in connection with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and breast cancer. The Company has also launched the Guardant360 TissueNext tissue test for advanced-stage cancer, Guardant Reveal blood test to detect residual and recurring disease in early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancer patients, and Guardant360 Response blood test to predict patient response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy eight weeks earlier than current standard-of-care imaging. 
The Company also collaborates with biopharmaceutical companies in clinical studies by providing the above-mentioned tests, as well as the GuardantOMNI blood test for advanced-stage cancer, and the GuardantINFINITY blood test, a next-generation Smart Liquid Biopsy that provides new, multi-dimensional insights into the complexities of tumor molecular profiles and immune response to advance cancer research and therapy development. Using data collected from its tests, the Company has also developed its GuardantINFORM platform to help biopharmaceutical companies accelerate precision oncology drug development through the use of this in-silico research platform to unlock further insights into tumor evolution and treatment resistance across various biomarker-driven cancers.
For early cancer detection, in May 2022, the Company launched the Shield LDT test to address the needs of individuals eligible for colorectal cancer screening. From a simple blood draw, Shield uses a novel multimodal approach to detect colorectal cancer signals in the bloodstream, including DNA that is shed by tumors. In December 2022, the Company announced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of its Shield blood test for detecting colorectal cancer in average-risk adults, met co-primary endpoints. In addition, in March 2023, the Company submitted a premarket approval application, or PMA, for its Shield blood test to the FDA. In July 2024, the Company received FDA approval of its Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who are at average risk for the disease, and in August 2024, the Company's Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the FDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning healthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended in screening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for colorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare. 
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in December 2011 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Guardant Health, Inc., its consolidated Joint Venture (see Note 3, 
Joint Venture
), and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company adjusted the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 to separately present accounts payable and accrued expenses, inclusive of accrued compensation. In addition, certain other reclassifications of prior period amounts were made to conform with the current period presentation. The Company determined the adjustment is immaterial based on consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors.
The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2024 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least a period of one year after the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are issued. As the Company continues to incur losses, its transition to profitability is dependent upon a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost 
101
Table of Contents
structure. If the Company’s transition to profitability is not consistent with its current operating plan, the Company may have to seek additional capital.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are used in several areas including, but not limited to, estimation of variable consideration, estimation of credit losses, standalone selling price allocation included in contracts with multiple performance obligations, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, stock-based compensation, incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, contingencies, certain inputs into the provision for income taxes, including related reserves, valuation of non-marketable securities, among others. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments, involve the analysis of historical results and prediction of future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve and are subject to change from period to period. Actual results may differ materially from management’s estimates.

Segment Information
The Company operates as 
one
 operating and reportable segment. The Company's chief operating decision makers are its Co-Chief Executive Officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. Cash equivalents include bank demand deposits and money market accounts that invest primarily in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had restricted cash balance of $
104.2
 million, of which $
103.6
 million was related to cash held as collateral under surety bond requirements related to the intellectual property dispute with TwinStrand Biosciences, Inc. and the University of Washington, as described in Note 9 
Commitments and Contingencies
 - Legal Proceedings to the Company's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's restricted cash balance was immaterial. 
Marketable Debt Securities
Marketable debt securities consist primarily of high-grade U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. Marketable debt securities with original maturities at the time of purchase between three and twelve months from balance sheet dates are classified as short-term marketable debt securities and those with maturities over twelve months from balance sheet dates are classified as long-term marketable debt securities. The Company classifies all marketable debt securities as available-for-sale, which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit). Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. 
The Company periodically evaluates its available-for-sale marketable debt securities for impairment. When the fair value of a marketable debt security is below its amortized cost, the amortized cost is reduced to its fair value if it is more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the impaired security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or the Company has the intention to sell the security. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company determines whether the impairment is due to credit losses by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows of the security with its amortized cost basis. The amount of impairment recognized is limited to the excess of the amortized cost over the fair value of the security. An allowance for credit losses for the excess of amortized cost over the expected cash flows is recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment losses that are not credit-related are included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit).
Non-Marketable Securities
The Company acquires certain equity investments in private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. The Company's investments in non-marketable equity securities do not give the Company the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the investees. One of the investees is concluded to be a variable interest entity, or 
102
Table of Contents
VIE, but the Company is deemed not to be the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. The Company's non-marketable equity and other related investments totaled $
16.1
 million and $
8.6
 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Non-marketable securities are recorded at cost, subject to periodic impairment reviews and adjustments for observable price changes from orderly transactions. The Company's evaluation of impairment of such non-marketable securities is based on adverse changes in market conditions and the regulatory or economic environment; qualitative and quantitative analysis of the operating performance and financial condition of the investee; changes in operating structure or management of the investee; and additional funding requirements of the investee. As a result of the evaluation, the Company recorded an impairment of $
22.1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 for 
one
 of its non-marketable equity security investments, included in other income (expense), net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In addition, in connection with the investment in non-marketable securities purchased by the Company, the Company acquired rights to purchase the investee at a pre-determined price subject to additional adjustments based on the performance of the investee, on or before December 31, 2022. In September 2022, the Company decided not to exercise such rights to purchase the investee and recorded an impairment of $
5.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in other income (expense), net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
Pursuant to another investment in non-marketable securities purchased by the Company, the Company acquired rights to purchase the investee at a pre-determined price subject to additional adjustments based on the performance of the Company, on or before October 1, 2023, and acquired rights to obtain the exclusive license of the investee's certain technologies. In June 2023, the Company decided not to exercise such rights and recorded an impairment of $
7.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in other income (expense), net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
No other impairment or downward adjustments to the carrying value of the Company's non-marketable securities have been otherwise recorded.

Concentration of Risk
The Company is subject to credit risk from its portfolio of cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities. The Company limits its exposure to credit losses by investing in money market funds through a U.S. bank with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash may consist of deposits held with banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits, however, its exposure to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institution is limited to the extent of amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure.
The Company also invests in investment‑grade debt instruments and has policy limits for the amount it can invest in any one type of security, except for securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. The goals of the Company’s investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after‑tax rate of return. Under its investment policy, the Company limits amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, investment type and issuer, as a result, the Company is not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments.
The Company is subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable. The majority of the Company’s accounts receivable arises from the provision of precision oncology services and development services and other, primarily with biopharmaceutical companies and international laboratory partners, all of which have high credit ratings. The Company has not experienced any material losses related to receivables from individual customers, or groups of customers. The Company does not require collateral. 
Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for credit losses, if any.

A significant customer is any biopharmaceutical customer, clinical testing payer, or international laboratory partner that represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue or accounts receivable balance. Revenue attributable to each significant customer, including its affiliated entities, as a percentage of the Company’s total revenue, for the respective period, and accounts receivable balance attributable to each significant customers, including its affiliated entities, as a percentage of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance, at the respective consolidated balance sheet date, are as follows:

Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable represent valid claims against commercial and governmental payers, biopharmaceutical companies, research institutes, international laboratory partners and distributors, including unbilled receivables, and royalty payments due from third parties for licensing the Company’s technologies. Unbilled receivables include balances due from biopharmaceutical customers related to development services and other revenues that are recognized upon the achievement of performance-based milestones but prior to the achievement of contractual billing rights. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had unbilled receivables of $
3.4
 million and $
4.9
 million, respectively.
The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external market factors and provides for an allowance for potential credit losses based on management’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
 The Company recorded immaterial credit losses related to its accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Inventory, Net
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consisted entirely of supplies, which are consumed when providing tests, and therefore the Company does not maintain any finished goods inventory.
In order to assess the ultimate realization of inventories, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared to current or committed inventory levels. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by the Company, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Amounts written-down due to unmarketable inventory are recorded in cost of precision oncology testing and cost of development services and other, as appropriate.

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed over estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The Company periodically reviews the depreciable lives assigned to property and equipment placed in service and changes the estimates of useful lives, if necessary. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or if circumstances indicate its value may no longer be recoverable. The Company continues to operate in 
one
 segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit and, therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. As of December 31, 2024, there has been 
no
 impairment of goodwill.
Intangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The Company does not have intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible asset's useful life, which is approximately 
6
—
12
 years.

Impairment for Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, and right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
 The Company had immaterial amount of impairment for long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets and operating leases liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received or receivable. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when the Company is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company also has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components from lease components for the Company’s facility leases. The Company also elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for leases with terms of 12 months or less.
Convertible Senior Notes
Convertible senior notes are accounted for as a liability and measured at their amortized cost. Transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes are netted with the liability and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes, using an effective interest rate method.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from the provision of precision oncology testing services, as well as from development services and other. Precision oncology testing revenue includes amounts derived from the delivery of the Company's precision oncology tests, including those tests delivered by labs operated by our strategic partners. Development services include companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval, clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. Other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing the Company's technologies, kit fulfillment, and delivery of the Company's Shield screening tests. The Company currently receives payments from third-party commercial and governmental payers, certain hospitals and oncology centers and individual patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, research institutes, international laboratory partners and distributors.
105
Table of Contents
Revenues are recognized when control of services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. FASB ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, provides for a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Precision oncology testing
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its precision oncology tests for clinical customers, including certain hospitals, cancer centers, other institutions and patients, at the time results of the test are reported to physicians. Most precision oncology tests requested by clinical customers are sold without a written agreement; however, the Company determines an implied contract exists with its clinical customers. The Company identifies each sale of its test to a clinical customer as a single performance obligation. With the exception of certain limited contracted arrangements with insurance carriers and other institutions where the transaction price is fixed, a stated contract price does not exist and the transaction price for each implied contract with clinical customers represents variable consideration. The Company estimates the variable consideration under the portfolio approach and considers the historical reimbursement data from third-party commercial and governmental payers and patients, as well as known or anticipated reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. The Company monitors the estimated amount to be collected in the portfolio at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the estimate and any subsequent revision contain uncertainty and require the use of significant judgment in the estimation of the variable consideration and application of the constraint for such variable consideration. The Company analyzes its actual cash collections over the expected reimbursement period and compares it with the estimated variable consideration for each portfolio and any difference is recognized as an adjustment to estimated revenue after the expected reimbursement period, subject to assessment of the risk of cumulative future revenue reversal. 
Revenue from sales of precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are based on a negotiated price per test or on the basis of an agreement to provide certain testing volume over a defined period. The Company identifies its promise to transfer a series of distinct tests to biopharmaceutical customers as a single performance obligation. Precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are generally billed at a fixed price for each test performed. For agreements involving testing volume to be satisfied over a defined period, revenue is recognized over time based on the number of tests performed as the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Results of the Company’s precision oncology services are delivered electronically, and as such there are no shipping or handling fees incurred by the Company or billed to customers.
Development services and other
The Company performs development services for its biopharmaceutical customers utilizing its precision oncology information platform. Development services typically represent a single performance obligation as the Company performs a significant integration service, such as analytical validation and regulatory submissions. The individual promises are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, are not distinct. However, under certain contracts, a biopharmaceutical customer may engage the Company for multiple distinct development services which are both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, distinct performance obligations. 
The Company collaborates with biopharmaceutical companies in the development of new drugs. As part of these collaborations, the Company provides services related to regulatory filings to support companion diagnostic device submissions for the Company’s testing panels. Under these collaborations, the Company generates revenue from achievement of milestones, as well as provision of on-going support. For the companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services performed, the Company is compensated through a combination of an upfront fee and performance-based, non-refundable regulatory and other developmental milestone payments. The transaction price of these contracts typically represents variable consideration. Application of the constraint for variable consideration to milestone payments is an area that requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be managed to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone. In making this assessment, the Company considers its historical experience with similar milestones, the degree of complexity and uncertainty associated with each milestone, and whether achievement of the milestone is dependent on parties other than the Company. The constraint for variable consideration is applied to the contract price such that it is probable a significant cumulative reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingency is resolved. Application of the constraint for variable consideration is assessed and updated at each reporting period as a revision to the estimated transaction price. 
106
Table of Contents
The Company recognizes companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services revenue over the period in which biopharmaceutical research and development services are provided. Specifically, the Company recognizes revenue using an input method to measure progress, utilizing costs incurred to-date relative to total expected costs as its measure of progress. The Company assesses the changes to the total expected cost estimates as well as any incremental fees negotiated resulting from changes to the scope of the original contract in determining the revenue recognition at each reporting period. For development of new products or services under these arrangements, costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are included as research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, while costs incurred thereafter are recorded as cost of development services and other.
The Company also recognizes revenue from other development services, in addition to companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services noted above, such as clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. These revenues are generally recognized over time based on an input method to measure progress in the period when the associated services have been performed. 
In addition, the Company licenses its digital sequencing technologies to its domestic customers and international laboratory partners. For the licensed technology, the Company is compensated through royalty-based payments, non-refundable upfront payments, guaranteed minimum payments, and/or sample milestone payments. Depending on the nature of the technology licensing arrangements, and considering factors including but not limited to enforceable right to payment and payment terms, and if an asset with alternative use is created, these revenues are recognized in the period when royalty-bearing sales occur, when the technology transfer is complete or over the technology transfer period. Other revenue also includes kit fulfillment, which is recognized when such products are delivered. In addition, other revenue includes amounts derived from delivery of the Company's Shield screening tests.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
35.3
 million, $
14.2
 million and $
8.8
 million, respectively, as revenue related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. 
Contracts with multiple performance obligations
Contracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners may include multiple distinct performance obligations, such as provision of precision oncology testing, the above-mentioned development services, and digital sequencing technology licensing, among others. The Company evaluates the terms and conditions included within its contracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners to ensure appropriate revenue recognition, including whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. The Company first identifies material promises, in contrast to immaterial promises or administrative tasks, under the contract, and then evaluates whether these promises are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. In assessing whether a promised service is capable of being distinct, the Company considers whether the customer could benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, including factors such as the research, development, and commercialization capabilities of a third party as well as the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In assessing whether a promised service is distinct within the context of the contract, the Company considers whether it provides a significant integration of the services, whether the services significantly modify or customize one another, or whether the services are highly interdependent or interrelated. 
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines standalone selling price by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay, competitive pricing of other vendors, industry publications and current pricing practices, and expected costs of satisfying each performance obligation plus appropriate margin; or by using the residual approach if standalone selling price is not observable, by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
Deferred revenue
Deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition from contracts with customers. For example, development services and other contracts with biopharmaceutical customers often contain upfront payments which results in the recording of deferred revenue to the extent cash is received prior to the Company’s performance of the related services. Contract liabilities are

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The Company expects to recognize substantially all of the remaining transaction price in the next 
1

2
 years.
Costs of Precision Oncology Testing
Cost of precision oncology testing generally consists of cost of materials, cost of labor, including bonus, benefit and stock-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing test samples (including sample accessioning, library preparation, sequencing, and quality control analyses), freight, curation of test results for physicians, phlebotomy, and license fees due to third parties. Infrastructure expenses include depreciation of laboratory equipment, lease costs, amortization of leasehold improvements, and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing the Company’s tests are recorded as the tests are performed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test.

Cost of Development Services and Other
Cost of development services and other primarily includes costs incurred for the performance of development services requested by the Company’s biopharmaceutical customers, and costs associated with the Company's partnership agreements and delivery of the Company's Shield screening tests. For development of new products, costs incurred before technological feasibility has been achieved are reported as research and development expenses, while costs incurred thereafter are reported as cost of development services and other.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to develop technology and include salaries and benefits including stock-based compensation, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including facility occupancy and information technology costs, contract services, other outside costs and costs to develop the Company's technology capabilities. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical companies before technological feasibility has been achieved. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are received or services are rendered. Costs to develop technology capabilities are recorded as research and development expenses unless they meet the criteria to be capitalized as internal-use software costs.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company's advertising costs were 
no
t material to the consolidated financial statements.
Stock‑Based Compensation
Stock‑based compensation related to stock options granted to the Company’s and the Joint Venture's employees, directors and nonemployees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Compensation expense for stock options with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant.
The Company uses the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the 2012 Stock Plan (as amended and restated), or the 2012 Plan, the 2018 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2018 Plan, the former Joint Venture's 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (see Note 11, 
Stock-Based Compensation
), and the 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan, or the 2023 Plan, and stock purchase rights granted under the 2018 
108
Table of Contents
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions to be made related to the expected term of an award, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.  
The Company measures the grant date fair value of its service-based and performance-based restricted stock units issued to employees and non-employees based on the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock units with only service-based vesting conditions, compensation expense is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics, or PSUs, is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, and is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations using an accelerated attribution model over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. No stock-based compensation expense is recorded for PSUs, unless it is determined to be probable that the related performance metrics will be met. In addition, a cumulative adjustment will be recorded in the period when the probability of achieving the related performance metrics is adjusted. Any PSUs that remain unvested at the end of the performance period will be forfeited. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
For market-based restricted stock units, or MSUs, the Company derived the grant date fair value and requisite service period using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the related compensation expense was recognized over the derived service period using an accelerated attribution model commencing on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense was recorded regardless of whether the market conditions were achieved or not. The MSUs were fully expensed as of June 30, 2022.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if current evidence indicates that it is considered more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
The Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a regular basis. The evaluations are based on a number of factors, including changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of the audit, and effective settlement of audit issues. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any accruals that the Company believes are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Net Loss Per Share 
The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock method or the as-if converted method, as appropriate. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, restricted stock units, shares issuable pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan, and contingently issuable shares under the convertible senior notes are considered common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and will be effective for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, and should be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted this pronouncement retrospectively in

Segment and Geographic Information
 to the consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which amended existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosures on the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. The Company expects to provide required disclosures upon the effective date.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
, which requires additional disclosures of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027, and for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2028, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this accounting pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.
3. 
Joint Venture
In May 2018, the Company and an affiliate of SoftBank formed and capitalized Guardant Health AMEA, Inc., the Joint Venture, for the sale, marketing and distribution of the Company’s tests generally outside the Americas and Europe, and to accelerate commercialization of its products in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, each party held an approximately 
50
% ownership interest in the Joint Venture and 
two
 seats on the board of the Joint Venture. 
In June 2022, the Company purchased all of the shares held by SoftBank and its affiliates in consideration for a cash payment of the aggregate purchase price of $
177.8
 million, which resulted in $
99.8
 million of fair value adjustments to the noncontrolling interest liability for the year ended December 31, 2022. In connection with the Joint Venture Acquisition, the Company also issued a tender offer to purchase the Joint Venture's Class B common stock issued and issuable upon exercise of vested Joint Venture's stock options held by the Joint Venture's employees (see Note 11, 
Stock-Based Compensation
). 
Prior to the completion of the Joint Venture Acquisition, the Joint Venture was deemed to be a VIE, and the Company had been identified as the VIE’s primary beneficiary. As the primary beneficiary, the Company had consolidated the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Joint Venture in its financial statements and all intercompany balances had been eliminated in consolidation. Upon completion of the Joint Venture Acquisition and the tender offer, Guardant Health AMEA, Inc. became the Company's wholly owned subsidiary.

Fair Value Measurements, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets, net, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at fair value. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, net, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The identification of market participant assumptions provides a basis for determining what inputs are to be used for pricing each asset or liability. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
A fair value hierarchy has been established which gives precedence to fair value measurements calculated using observable inputs over those using unobservable inputs. This hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three broad levels as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
111
Table of Contents
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis and the level of inputs used in such measurements were as follows:

The Company measures the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Income deposit funds and U.S. government debt securities are valued taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities; prepayment/default projections based on historical data; and other observable inputs.
In July 2022, one of the Company's equity investees, Lunit Inc., or Lunit, completed its initial public offering, or IPO, subsequent to which, the Company started to account for the investment in Lunit at fair value on a recurring basis, and classified the investment as marketable equity securities within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as the 
112
Table of Contents
investment is valued using the quoted market price. The Company was subject to a 
2-year
 lock-up period from Lunit's IPO date, during which the Company shall not transfer Lunit's shares between accounts, establish or cancel pledges, sell, or withdraw such shares, without approval from the Korea Exchange. In November 2023, Lunit issued bonus shares to its existing shareholders by allocating 
one
 new share for each existing share, and the Company was subject to the same lock-up period with the same restrictions for these bonus shares which expired in July 2024. In 2024, the Company sold all of its investment in Lunit. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Company's investment in Lunit was $
98.0
 million, included in other assets, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company recorded $
79.7
 million unrealized gains and $
7.8
 million unrealized losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, on its investment in Lunit, respectively, included in other income (expense), net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the periods presented.
Acquisition-related contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis and changes in estimated contingent consideration to be paid are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is estimated using a multiple-outcome discounted cash flow valuation technique. Contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as it is based on a probability that includes significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs include a probability-weighted estimate of achievement of certain commercialization milestones, and discount rate to present value the expected payments. A significant change in any of these input factors in isolation could have a material impact to fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's acquisition-related contingent consideration liability was $
6.1
 million and  $
6.5
 million, respectively, of which $
2.1
 million and $
5.0
 million was considered long-term and recorded within other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Prior to the completion of the Joint Venture Acquisition in June 2022, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest liability was considered to be a Level 3 measurement and was determined based on an annual internal rate of return of 
20
% on the initial amount of $
41.0
 million invested by SoftBank in May 2018, to the date of Company's exercising the call right in November 2021. The noncontrolling interest liability was fully paid by June 30, 2022 (see Note 3, 
Joint Venture
).

The Company considers the fair value of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024 to be a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of the Convertible Notes is primarily affected by the trading price of the Company's common stock and market interest rates. As such, the carrying value of the Convertible Notes does not reflect the market rate. See Note 7, 
Debt
, for additional information related to the Convertible Notes.

Debt
Convertible Senior Notes
In November 2020, the Company issued $
1.15
 billion principal amount of its 
0
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027, or the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes do not bear interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the 2027 Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 
0.50
% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events such as the failure to file certain reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2027, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted earlier. 
Before August 15, 2027, holders of the 2027 Notes will have the right to convert their 2027 Notes only under the following circumstances:
•
during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, or the sale price condition;
•
during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
ten
 consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the measurement period is less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; or
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events
115
From and after August 15, 2027, holders of the 2027 Notes may convert their 2027 Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. 
The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. 
The initial conversion rate is 7.1523 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
139.82
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.
The Company may not redeem the 2027 Notes at its option at any time before November 20, 2024. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after November 20, 2024 and on or before the 25th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.
If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, holders of Notes may require the Company to repurchase their 2027 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock.
Since the 2027 Notes were not convertible as of December 31, 2024, the net carrying amount of the 2027 Notes was classified as a long-term liability.
In February 2025, the Company entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of its 2027 Notes. See Note 17, 
Subsequent Events,
 for additional information related to this transaction.
The following table sets forth the net carrying amounts of the 2027 Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Note Hedges
To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the 2027 Note Hedges, with respect to its common stock concurrent with the issuance of the Notes. The 2027 Note Hedges cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. The strike price of the 2027 Note Hedges will initially be approximately $
182.60
 per share, which represents a premium of 
75
% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $
104.34
 per share on November 16, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2027 Note Hedges.
The 2027 Note Hedges will expire upon maturity of the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. Holders of the 2027 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the 2027 Note Hedges. The shares receivable related to the 2027 Note Hedges are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive.
As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2027 Note Hedges are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The Company paid an aggregate amount of $
90.0
 million for the 2027 Note Hedges, which has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured.

8. 
Leases
The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, data center, lab and warehouse use, with remaining terms ranging from 
0.2
 to 
8.5
 years, some of which include one or more options to renew. As leases approach maturity, the Company considers various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether it will renew the lease, as such, the Company does not include renewal options in its lease terms for calculating its lease liability, as the renewal options allow it to maintain operational flexibility and the Company is not reasonably certain it will exercise these renewal options at the time of the lease commencement.
Operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
31.1
 million, $
29.7
 million and $
28.6

Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnification Agreements
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with certain directors and officers that require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. To date, no such matters have arisen and the Company does not believe that the outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material adverse effect on its financial positions, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a liability related to such indemnifications as of December 31, 2024.
Legal Proceedings
In addition to commitments and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, from time to time the Company may be subject to a variety of claims and legal proceedings, including claims from customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, governmental investigations and other matters. For example, the Company has received, and may in the future continue to receive letters, claims or complaints from others alleging false advertising, patent infringement, violation of employment practices and trademark infringement. The Company has also instituted, and may in the future institute, additional legal proceedings to enforce its rights and seek remedies, such as monetary damages, injunctive relief and declaratory relief. The Company cannot predict the results of any such disputes, and despite the potential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse material impact on the Company because of diversion of management time and attention as well as the financial costs related to resolving such disputes.
The Company and its affiliates are parties to the legal claims and proceedings described below. The Company is vigorously defending itself against those claims and in those proceedings. Significant developments in those matters are described below. If the Company is unsuccessful in defending, or if it determines to settle, any of these matters, it may be required to pay substantial sums, be subject to injunction and/or be forced to change how it operates its business, which could have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Unless otherwise stated, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible loss for the matters described below. Often, it is not reasonably possible for the Company to determine that a loss is probable for a claim, or to reasonably estimate the amount of loss or a range of loss, because of the limited information available and the potential effects of future events and decisions by third parties, such as courts and regulators, that will determine the ultimate resolution of the claim. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages, raise novel theories of liability or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over a number of years. The Company reviews loss contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the loss probability has changed and whether it can make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. When the Company determines that a loss from a claim is probable and reasonably estimable, it records a liability in the amount of its estimate for the ultimate loss. The Company also provides disclosure when it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed its recorded liability.

Intellectual Property Disputes
In August 2021, TwinStrand Biosciences, Inc., or TwinStrand Biosciences, and the University of Washington filed a patent infringement suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 10,287,631; 10,689,699; 10,752,951; and 10,760,127. The Company answered the complaint in October 2021, denying TwinStrand Biosciences’ allegations and asserted counterclaims of invalidity, unenforceability due to inequitable conduct and infringement of 
four
 of the Company’s patents. Discovery in the case has concluded. In October 2023, the District Court dismissed with prejudice TwinStrand’s infringement claims related to U.S. Patent Nos. 10,689,699 and 10,752,951. 
On November 14, 2023, a jury verdict was entered in favor of TwinStrand Biosciences and the University of Washington and against the Company. The jury found that the Company willfully infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 10,287,631 and 10,760,127, and awarded TwinStrand Biosciences and the University of Washington $
83.4
 million in damages, representing a 
6
% royalty on past sales. As a result, the Company recorded a liability of $
83.4
 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was reflected as a charge to other operating expense on its consolidated statements of operations, and as a component of other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. Post-trial motions were filed on March 4, 2024, where the Company moved to overturn the jury’s verdict, seek a new trial, and/or amend the judgment, and TwinStrand Biosciences moved for enhanced damages based on the jury’s finding of willful infringement, pre- and post-judgment interest, and a go-forward running royalty. A hearing date has not yet been set on the post-trial motions. The Company strongly disagrees with the jury verdict and will vigorously contest the verdict and judgment through post-trial motions in the District Court, and if needed, through appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
On June 11, 2024, the Company filed a patent infringement suit against Tempus AI, Inc. or Tempus, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Tempus infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 11,149,306; 9,902,992; 10,501,810; 10,793,916; and 11,643,693. The Company is seeking an injunction to stop Tempus’ infringement and compensatory damages. The case 
Guardant Health, Inc. v. Tempus AI, Inc.
, Case No. 1:24-cv-00687, has been assigned to Judge Richard Andrews and does not yet have a scheduling order. On October 21, 2024, Tempus moved to dismiss the Company’s suit alleging that some of the asserted patents were invalid. The Company disagrees and will be responding accordingly.
False Advertising Disputes
In May 2021, the Company also filed a lawsuit against Natera, Inc., or Natera, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, wherein the Company alleged that Natera is misleading healthcare providers about the performance of the Company’s new oncology test, Guardant Reveal, by suggesting the test is inaccurate and/or insensitive, and inferior to Natera’s Signatera assay. The Company is seeking an injunction to prevent Natera from continuing to make false and misleading statements and to require Natera to take corrective actions. Natera asserted counterclaims of false and misleading statements, false advertising, unlawful trade practices and unfair competition. The Company moved to dismiss Natera’s counterclaims, and in January 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion to dismiss.
On November 25, 2024, after a three-week trial before Judge Edward M. Chen, the jury unanimously found in favor of the Company on all of its claims against Natera for false advertising and unfair competition. The jury awarded the Company $
292.5
 million, including $
175.5
 million in punitive damages. The jury also unanimously rejected all of Natera’s counterclaims against the Company. Both parties have filed post-trial briefing, which will be considered by Judge Chen at a hearing scheduled for March 2025.
On January 13, 2025, Tempus sent the Company a letter alleging that the Company made certain false or misleading statements in its advertising related to Guardant360 and Tempus’ xF+ assay. The Company strongly disagrees with Tempus’ allegations and responded to each allegation. On January 17, 2025, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Tempus in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking to show that Tempus’ allegations are without merit.

2.2
 years.
Performance-based Restricted Stock Units
Since November 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors started to approve, and the Company started to grant performance-based restricted stock units, or PSUs, to its employees and non-employees. The PSUs granted consist of financial and/or operational metrics to be met over a performance period of approximately 
0.6
 to 
4
 years and an additional service period requirement of up to 
2
 years after the performance metrics are met. In addition, granted units might be adjusted when certain performance metrics are met. The PSUs are expected to be expensed over a period of approximately 
0.6
 to 
4.5
 years subject to meeting the respective performance metrics and service requirements. 
In November 2020 and May 2021, and as part of these PSU programs, the Company granted PSUs consisting of a performance period of 
4
 years combined with an additional service period requirement of 
six months
 should the vesting criteria be met with a grant date fair value of $
113.40
 per share and $
148.19
 per share, respectively. Before 2024, 
no
 compensation expense for these PSUs had been recorded since the achievement of the performance metrics did not meet the criteria for accrual. In 2024, the performance metrics of these PSUs were considered to be achieved; as such the Company recorded $
24.8
 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these PSUs, based on 
219,161
 shares granted with fair values of $
113.40
 per share and $
148.19
 per share.

Market-based Restricted Stock Units
In May 2020, the Board of Directors approved and granted 
1,695,574
 market-based restricted stock units, or MSUs, under the 2018 Plan to each of the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers, which is subject to the achievement of market-based share price goals established by the Board of Directors. The MSUs consist of 
three
 separate tranches and the vesting of each tranche is subject to the Company's common stock closing price being maintained at or above a predetermined share price goal for a period of 
30
 consecutive calendar days. The grant date fair values of the MSUs were determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model for each tranche. The related stock-based compensation expense for each tranche was recognized based on an accelerated attribution method over the estimated derived service period, which was the median duration of the successful stock price paths to meet the price goal for each tranche as simulated in the Monte Carlo valuation model. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the MSUs was $
67.00
 per share and the weighted-average derived service period was estimated to be in the range of 
0.83
 – 
2.07
 years. 
All three tranches of the MSUs were fully expensed as of June 30, 2022. Stock-based compensation for the MSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $
16.1
 million, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
On January 1, 2021, Tranche 1 of the MSUs became vested because it had met both service requirement and market-based performance metrics. 
No
 MSUs were granted, vested or canceled during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. As of December 31, 2023, 
2,260,764
 shares of the MSUs, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $
65.20
 per share, were outstanding under the 2018 Plan. In March 2024, the Board of Directors approved to cancel the unvested MSUs and concurrently approved to grant new awards to the Co-Chief Executive Officers, which was accounted for as a modification, however no stock-based compensation expense was reversed as the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers had fulfilled the service requirement.
AMEA 2020 Equity Incentive Plan
In August 2020, the board of directors of the Joint Venture approved its 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, or the AMEA 2020 Plan, under which the Joint Venture may grant equity incentive awards to its employees and non-employees.

In June 2022, in connection with the Joint Venture Acquisition, the Company issued a tender offer to purchase the Joint Venture's Class B common stock issued and issuable upon exercise of vested Joint Venture's stock options, at a price of $
4.44
 per share determined pursuant to an independent valuation. In July 2022, the Company settled the tender offer with the 
39
 grantees for a total amount of $
13.7
 million. In addition, in connection with the Joint Venture Acquisition, the unvested Joint Venture's stock options were cancelled and such grantees received replacement awards covering a number of shares of the Company's common stock. The replacement awards, valued at $
4.1
 million, are subject to the same vesting schedule that applied to the unvested Joint Venture's stock option immediately prior to the close of the Joint Venture Acquisition transaction, to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.2
 years. The Company accounted for this as a modification which resulted in an immaterial incremental stock-based compensation expense. After the settlement of the tender offer in July 2022, the Company cancelled the AMEA 2020 Plan.

Table of Contents
The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the estimated fair value of common stock of the Company, as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables that are complex, subjective and generally require significant judgment to determine. The valuation assumptions were determined as follows:
Fair Value of Common Stock
The fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
Expected Term
The expected term represents the period that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) as the Company has concluded that its stock option exercise history does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
Expected Volatility
Prior to the commencement of trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 4, 2018 in connection with its IPO, there was no active trading market for the Company’s common stock. Due to limited historical data for the trading of the Company’s common stock, expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded peer group companies in the same industry plus the Company's expected volatility for the available periods. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate, with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options.
Expected Dividend Yield
The Company does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.
2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In September 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted and its stockholders approved the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. A total of 
922,250
 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. On the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on and including January 1, 2028, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP may be increased by the least of (i) 
1,106,700
 shares, (ii) 
1
% of the shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year, assuming the conversion of any shares of preferred stock, but excluding shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of stock options, warrants or other equity securities with respect to which shares have not actually been issued, and (iii) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. Effective as of January 1, 2020, March 2, 2023 and February 23, 2024, an additional 
942,614
, 
1,026,194
 and 
1,106,700
 shares of common stock became available for issuance under the ESPP.
Subject to any plan limitations, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, normally through payroll deductions, up to 
10
% of their earnings for the purchase of the Company’s common stock at a discounted price per share. The price at which common stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to 
85
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The ESPP provides for separate 
six-month
 offering periods beginning on May 15 and November 15 of each year.
Shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP were 
577,758
, 
464,870
 and 
307,953
, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total compensation expense related to the ESPP was $
4.7
 million, $
5.1
 million and $
4.6
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The grant date fair value of the stock purchase right granted under the ESPP was estimated on the first day of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions used in the valuation were substantially consistent with the assumptions used to value stock options with the exception of the expected term which was based on the term of each purchase period:

The Company’s actual tax expense differed from the statutory federal income tax expense using a tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, state income taxes net of federal benefits, withholding taxes, research and development tax credits, and stock-based compensation expenses.  
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $
1.6
 billion and $
1.4
 billion for federal purposes, and $
1.4
 billion and $
1.0
 billion for state and local purposes, respectively, which may be subject to limitations as described below. If not utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031 for federal purposes, and 2025 for state and local purposes. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. Some but not all states conform to the federal treatment of net operating losses.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
47.9
 million, net of reserve of $
25.8
 million, and $
29.7
 million, net of reserve of $
16.0
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
41.9
 million, net of reserve of $
22.6
 million, and $
26.1
 million, net of reserve of $
14.0
 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2032. The Company’s state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire.
Utilization of the net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization. Current laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL carryforwards and credits in the event of an “ownership change” within a three-year period as defined by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382, or Section 382. If there should be an ownership change, the Company’s ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards and credits could be limited. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis.
Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Due to the Company’s history of U.S. operating losses, the Company believes that the recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not more likely than not to be realized and, accordingly, have provided a full valuation allowance against net U.S. deferred tax assets. The net change in total valuation allowance was an increase of $
92.7
 million, an increase of $
114.7
 million and an increase of $
175.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Company considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. The Company has not recorded a provision for deferred U.S. federal and state income tax expense and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $
3.7
 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If the foreign earnings are repatriated, the income tax provision would be adjusted in the period the earnings are determined to be no longer indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, taxes as a current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.
128
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company records unrecognized tax benefits, where appropriate, for all uncertain income tax positions. The Company recorded unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $
42.1
 million and $
36.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which, if recognized, would not affect the effective income tax rate due to the valuation allowance that currently offsets the deferred tax assets. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized 
no
 interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. There are 
no
 tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date.
Due to the net operating loss carryforwards, all years remain open for income tax examination by tax authorities in the United States, various states and foreign tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns.

14. 
Employee Benefit Plan
The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, or a 401(k) plan, and pursuant to its terms, eligible employees can elect to contribute to the 401(k) plan, subject to certain limitations, up to the lesser of the statutory maximum or 
100
% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed $
7.9
 million, $
7.1
 million and $
6.7
 million, respectively, to match employee contributions as permitted by the plan. The Company pays the administrative costs for the plan.
15. 
Segment and Geographic Information
The Company operates as 
one
 operating segment, and the Company's chief operating decision makers, or the CODMs, are its Co-Chief Executive Officers. The CODMs review segment financial information presented on a consolidated basis, including revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, net loss and adjusted EBITDA, and considers budget-to-actual variances for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. The CODMs do not evaluate operating segment performance using asset information.

Related Party Transactions
As discussed in Note 3, 
Joint Venture
, in May 2018, the Company and an affiliate of SoftBank formed and capitalized the Joint Venture to accelerate commercialization of its products in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Prior to the completion of the Joint Venture Acquisition in June 2022, the Company had consolidated the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Joint Venture in its financial statements and all intercompany balances had been eliminated in consolidation.
17. 
Subsequent Events
In February 2025, the Company entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of its 2027 Notes, pursuant to which the Company issued $
600.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
1.25
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, or the New Notes, in exchange for the retirement of $
659.3
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, or the Transaction. The Company will settle conversions of the New Notes by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. The initial conversion rate of the New Notes is 16.0716 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the New Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
62.22
 per share of common stock, which reflects a conversion premium of approximately 
35
% to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on February 6, 2025. The conversion rate and conversion price is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Following the closing of the Transaction, $
490.7
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes remain outstanding with terms unchanged. 
In connection with the Transaction, in February 2025, the Company repurchased $
45.0
 million of shares of its common stock from certain participants in the Transaction through a financial intermediary at a price of $
46.09
 per share, which was the last reported sale price of its common stock on February 6, 2025.

Our management, with the participation of our co-chief executive officers, or Co-CEOs, and chief financial officer, or CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Co-CEOs and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such required information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-CEOs and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management report on internal control over financial reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-CEOs and CFO, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of our assessment under the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in internal control
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management, including our Co-CEOs and CFO, do not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Guardant Health, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Guardant Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
