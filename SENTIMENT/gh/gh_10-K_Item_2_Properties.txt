Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California, where we lease approximately 249,500 square feet of office and lab space. The lease for the Palo Alto office was entered into in July 2020 and has a term of 12 years with an option to renew the lease term for an additional 10 years. In addition, we have approximately 200,000 square feet of additional office and lab space in Redwood City and San Diego, California, with current lease expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2029. We also maintain domestic leased office spaces in Dallas and Spring, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Long Island City, New York; and Washington, D.C.; and warehouse space in Union City, California. In addition, for international locations, we maintain leased office space in Japan, Singapore and India. While we believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current requirements, we expect to expand our facilities as our operations grow over time. We believe we will be able to obtain such additional space on acceptable and commercially reasonable terms.
